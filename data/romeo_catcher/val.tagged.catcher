here I [catcher0] born, an what my lousy childhood [catcher3] like, and how my parents were occupied [catcher5] before they [catcher7] me, [catcher7] that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.
They're nice [catcher0]
I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come [catcher8] here and take it easy.
I [catcher0] that's all I told D.B. about, and he's my brother and all.
That isn't too far from this crumby place, and [catcher3] comes over and visits me practically every week end.
One of those little English jobs that can do around [catcher3] hundred miles an hour.
He used to be just a regular writer, when [catcher3] home.
The best one in it [catcher1] The Secret Goldfish.
It [catcher0] about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money.
Don't even mention [catcher1] to me.
Like as if all you ever did at Pencey [catcher3] play polo all the time.
And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: Since 1888 [catcher4] have [catcher5] molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men.
And I didn't know anybody there that [catcher2] splendid and clear-thinking and all.
Maybe [catcher0] guys.
And [catcher0] probably came to Pencey that way.
with Saxon Hall [catcher1] supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey.
It [catcher0] the last game
Anyway, it [catcher0] the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall.
I wasn't supposed to come The reason I [catcher2] standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't win.
I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I [catcher2] standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that [catcher8] in the Revolutionary War and all.
You could see the whole field from there, and you could [catcher3] the [catcher4] teams bashing each other all over the place.
You couldn't [catcher0] the grandstand too hot, but you could hear [catcher3] all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me [catcher9] there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.
It [catcher0] a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it.
Old Selma Thurmer--she [catcher1] the headmaster's daughter--showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad with desire.
She [catcher0] a pretty nice girl, though.
She [catcher0] a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking
and she [catcher0] on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but
you [catcher0] sort of sorry for her.
She probably knew what a phony slob [catcher2] was.
[catcher0] because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team.
I [catcher0] the goddam manager of the fencing team.
I [catcher0] to keep getting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to get off.
So [catcher0] got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime.
It [catcher0] pretty funny, in a way.
The other reason I wasn't down at the game [catcher3] because I [catcher4] on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher.
He [catcher0] the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started.
He wrote me this note saying [catcher2] wanted to see me before I went home.
back after Christmas vacation on account of I [catcher2] flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all.
Anyway, it [catcher0] December and all, and it [catcher2] cold as a witch's teat, especially on top of that stupid hill.
I only [catcher0] on my reversible and no gloves or anything.
The week before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right [catcher3] of my room, with my fur- lined gloves right in the pocket and all.
Pencey [catcher0] full of crooks.
Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it [catcher4] full of crooks anyway.
What I [catcher0] really hanging around for, I [catcher2] trying to feel some kind
It [catcher0] icy as hell of a good-by.
I didn't even know I [catcher1] leaving them.
I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad goodby, but when I leave a place I [catcher6] to know I'm leaving it.
I [catcher0] lucky.
All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I [catcher4] getting the hell out.
It [catcher0] just before dinner and it [catcher2] getting pretty dark out, but [catcher4] kept chucking the ball around anyway.
It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly [catcher3] the ball any more, but [catcher5] didn't want to stop doing what [catcher7] were doing.
Finally [catcher0] had to.
That's also how I practically got t.b. and came [catcher3] here for all these goddam checkups and stuff.
I don't even know what I [catcher2] running for--I guess I just felt like it.
After I got across the road, I felt like I [catcher3] sort of disappearing.
It [catcher0] that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun [catcher4] or anything, and you [catcher6] like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.
, I said right [catcher1] loud, almost, somebody open the door.
I think she [catcher1] glad to see me.
She [catcher0] sort of deaf.
I [catcher0] really Boy, did I get in that house fast.
She didn't hear me ask her how Mr. I've [catcher3] just fine, Holden.
They got a bang [catcher1] of things, though--in a haif-assed way, of course.
I know that sounds mean to say, but I don't [catcher3] it mean.
I just [catcher0] that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you wondered what the heck [catcher9] still living for.
I [catcher0] all stooped over, and [catcher2] had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever [catcher5] dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard, some guy in the first row always [catcher11] to get up and pick it up and hand it to him.
But if you thought about him just enough and not too much, you could figure it [catcher5] that [catcher6] wasn't doing too bad for himself.
For instance, one Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, [catcher5] showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that [catcher8] and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in Yellowstone Park.
You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big bang [catcher5] of buying a blanket.
could see where [catcher1] sitting.
He [catcher0] sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up in that blanket
[catcher0] yelled.
He [catcher0] always yelling, outside class.
The minute I went in, I [catcher2] sort of sorry I'd come.
He [catcher0] reading the Atlantic Monthly, and there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled like Vicks Nose Drops.
It [catcher0] pretty depressing.
What made it even more depressing, old Spencer [catcher2] on this very sad, ratty old bathrobe that [catcher5] probably born in or something.
I don't [catcher0] like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway.
Then [catcher0] finally straightened himself [catcher1] and said, Why aren't you down at the game?
I thought this [catcher1] the day of the big game.
Boy, his bed [catcher1] like a rock.
You never [catcher0] if [catcher1] nodding a lot because he [catcher3] thinking and all, or just because [catcher6] a nice old guy that didn't know his ass from his elbow.
M'boy, if I [catcher1] any better I'd have to send for the doctor, old Spencer said.
That His door [catcher1] open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all.
I [catcher0] would.
[catcher0]
He said [catcher0] going to write [catcher2] Monday.
No, sir, I haven't communicated with them, because I'll probably see [catcher3]
I understand you [catcher1] quite a little chat.
Yes, [catcher0] did.
I [catcher0] in his office for around two hours, I guess.
What'd [catcher0] say to you?
