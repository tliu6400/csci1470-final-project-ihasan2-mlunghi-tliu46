here I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.
They're nice and all
I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy.
I mean that's all I told D.B. about, and he's my brother and all.
That isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end.
One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour.
He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home.
The best one in it was The Secret Goldfish.
It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money.
Don't even mention them to me.
Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time.
And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men.
And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all.
Maybe two guys.
And they probably came to Pencey that way.
with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey.
It was the last game
Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall.
I wasn't supposed to come The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't win.
I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all.
You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place.
You couldn't see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.
It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it.
Old Selma Thurmer--she was the headmaster's daughter--showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad with desire.
She was a pretty nice girl, though.
She had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking
and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but
you felt sort of sorry for her.
She probably knew what a phony slob he was.
was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team.
I was the goddam manager of the fencing team.
I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to get off.
So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime.
It was pretty funny, in a way.
The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher.
He had the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started.
He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home.
back after Christmas vacation on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all.
Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on top of that stupid hill.
I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything.
The week before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur- lined gloves right in the pocket and all.
Pencey was full of crooks.
Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway.
What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind
It was icy as hell of a good-by.
I didn't even know I was leaving them.
I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad goodby, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm leaving it.
I was lucky.
All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was getting the hell out.
It was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway.
It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn't want to stop doing what we were doing.
Finally we had to.
That's also how I practically got t.b. and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff.
I don't even know what I was running for--I guess I just felt like it.
After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing.
It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.
, I said right out loud, almost, somebody open the door.
I think she was glad to see me.
She was sort of deaf.
I was really Boy, did I get in that house fast.
She didn't hear me ask her how Mr. I've been just fine, Holden.
They got a bang out of things, though--in a haif-assed way, of course.
I know that sounds mean to say, but I don't mean it mean.
I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you wondered what the heck he was still living for.
I mean he was all stooped over, and he had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him.
But if you thought about him just enough and not too much, you could figure it out that he wasn't doing too bad for himself.
For instance, one Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in Yellowstone Park.
You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket.
could see where he was sitting.
He was sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up in that blanket
he yelled.
He was always yelling, outside class.
The minute I went in, I was sort of sorry I'd come.
He was reading the Atlantic Monthly, and there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled like Vicks Nose Drops.
It was pretty depressing.
What made it even more depressing, old Spencer had on this very sad, ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something.
I don't much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway.
Then he finally straightened himself out and said, Why aren't you down at the game?
I thought this was the day of the big game.
Boy, his bed was like a rock.
You never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was thinking and all, or just because he was a nice old guy that didn't know his ass from his elbow.
M'boy, if I felt any better I'd have to send for the doctor, old Spencer said.
That His door was open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all.
I knew he would.
he
He said he was going to write them Monday.
No, sir, I haven't communicated with them, because I'll probably see them
I understand you had quite a little chat.
Yes, we did.
I was in his office for around two hours, I guess.
What'd he say to you?
