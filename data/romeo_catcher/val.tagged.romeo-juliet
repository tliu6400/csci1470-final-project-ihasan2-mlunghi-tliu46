JULIET appears above at a [romeo-juliet1]
But, soft! what light through yonder [romeo-juliet2] breaks?
That thou her maid art far more fair [romeo-juliet2] she:
She speaks [romeo-juliet0] she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I [romeo-juliet1] answer it.
The brightness of her cheek [romeo-juliet1] shame those stars,
That birds [romeo-juliet0] sing and think it were not night.
As glorious to this night, being o'er my [romeo-juliet2]
By [romeo-juliet0] name [romeo-juliet1] smell as sweet;
Henceforth I never [romeo-juliet1] be Romeo.
Had I it written, I [romeo-juliet1] tear the word.
My ears have not [romeo-juliet1] drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, [romeo-juliet1] I know the sound:
Art thou [romeo-juliet0] Romeo and a Montague?
If any [romeo-juliet0] kinsmen find thee here.
If they do see thee, they [romeo-juliet2] murder thee.
I [romeo-juliet0] not for the world they saw thee here.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as [romeo-juliet2]
I [romeo-juliet0] adventure for such merchandise.
Else [romeo-juliet0] a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
Fain [romeo-juliet0] I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
And I will take thy word: [romeo-juliet2] if thou swear'st,
O, swear [romeo-juliet0] by the moon, the inconstant moon,
Do [romeo-juliet0] swear at all;
Which is the god [romeo-juliet1] idolatry,
And [romeo-juliet0] I [romeo-juliet1] it were to give again.
And [romeo-juliet0] I wish but for the thing I have:
Thy purpose marriage, [romeo-juliet1] me word to-morrow,
To-morrow [romeo-juliet0] I send.
Love goes [romeo-juliet0] love, as schoolboys from
But love from love, [romeo-juliet1] school with heavy looks.
Else [romeo-juliet0] I tear the cave where Echo lies,
With repetition [romeo-juliet0] Romeo's name.
I [romeo-juliet0] fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
And I'll [romeo-juliet0] stay, to have thee [romeo-juliet2] forget,
'Tis almost morning; I [romeo-juliet1] have thee gone:
And [romeo-juliet0] no further [romeo-juliet1] a wanton's bird;
I [romeo-juliet0] I were thy bird.
Sweet, so [romeo-juliet0] I:
Hence [romeo-juliet0] I to my ghostly father's cell,
