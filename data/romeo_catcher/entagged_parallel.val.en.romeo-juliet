JULIET appears above at a window
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
By any other name would smell as sweet;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
I would adventure for such merchandise.
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
Do not swear at all;
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And yet I would it were to give again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
To-morrow will I send.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
I would I were thy bird.
Sweet, so would I:
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
