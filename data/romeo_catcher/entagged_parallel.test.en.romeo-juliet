JULIET appears above at a window
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
By any other name would smell as sweet;
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
I would adventure for such merchandise.
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
And yet I would it were to give again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
Stay but a little, I will come again.
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
To-morrow will I send.
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.
Shall I send to thee?
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
I would I were thy bird.
Sweet, so would I:
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
