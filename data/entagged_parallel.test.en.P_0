clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , " mahoney said .

the new language is highlighted on page 2 of the appendix and states the following : " further and with respect to customer only , customer represents and warrants to company continuing throughout the term of this agreement as follows : ( i ) all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this agreement have been duly adopted , ( ii ) with respect to the contractual obligations hereunder and performance thereof , it is not entitled to claim immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or similar grounds with respect to itself or its revenues , ( iii ) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures to which it is a party .
my reading is that enron seeks a continuing representation that ( i ) all transactions have the appropriate approval , waiving any defense of lack of authority , ( ii ) there is no sovereign immunity ( something is left out of thelanguage ) defense to any transaction , ( iii ) payment for the gas will be first in the flow of funds , and ( iv ) the obligations are not subject to debt restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the texas constitution , statutes or cps constituency documents .

there is a mistake on page 5 regarding the percentage top that needs to pass outside merit order dispatch ( it 's 75 % rather than 78 % ) .
the " catch " is in two places : first , whether dispatch of dpc power meets the test ( shubh told me recently it did -- does this continue to hold true , mohan ? ) , and second , the recovery of the power purchase costs due to the variance ( the difference between what is authorized in the order and what is actually dispatched . )
thus , i have a query : let 's assume that the merc does not have jurisdiction to determine least cost purchases or merit order dispatch or to determine a blend of the two .
mohan - my gut feel is that there will not be a 75 % despatch on all three blocks .

kay , ed , question : i have not contacted tdc to determine if they have filed a claim with the court .
jeff , in general , i agree with you that absent market power price caps are bad policy .
my only comment is that , in our view , the price cap ( which would cover all capacity in the secondary market ) is simply bad economic policy and wo n't address any problems -- in fact it will only create problems .
will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them ?
anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill - advised ?
except for the little bombshell about extending commission jurisdiction over gas marketers , i see little in the rpd to warrant our opposition .
i admit that i have made a few errors , however , it is clear to me that the real issue is the fact that the program that pam uses to query deal tracker is innacurate .
the majority of " mistakes " are just instances where ibook does not pull accurately from dealtracker .

how did it become a crime to defend one 's own life in the once - great british empire ?
when the smoke cleared , 17 people were dead .
the british public , already de - sensitized by eighty years of " gun control " , demanded even tougher restrictions .
( the seizure of all privately owned handguns was the objective even though ryan used a rifle . )
nine years later , at dunblane , scotland , thomas hamilton used a semi - automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at a public school .
for many years , the media had portrayed all gun owners as mentally unstable , or worse , criminals .
during the years in which the british government incrementally took away most gun rights , the notion that a citizen had the right to armed self - defense came to be seen as vigilantism .
authorities refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened , claiming that self - defense was no longer considered a reason to own a gun .
citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were charged while the real criminals were released .
all of martin 's neighbors had been robbed numerous times , and several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young thugs who had no fear of the consequences .
martin himself , a collector of antiques , had seen most of his collection trashed or stolen by burglars .
when the dunblane inquiry ended , citizens who owned handguns were given three months to turn them over to local authorities .
how did the authorities know who had handguns ?

the longhorn defense was so dominant that it scored two touchdowns , and houston , which has one of the nation 's most potent offenses , got inside the texas 20-yard line only two times .
mckinley was one of the nation 's top passers heading into the game after three straight 300-yard passing game , but a fierce texas pass rush limited him to 173 yards through the air on 14 of 34 passing and sacked him nine times for minus 59 yards .
the cougars came right back with their only sustained drive of the game , zipping from their own 22 to the ut 6 , but de cory redding sacked mckinley and he fumbled , with redding covering the loose ball .

enron 's skilling cites stock - price plunge as main reason for leaving ceo post by john r. emshwiller 08/16/2001
jeffrey k. skilling said that the pressure he felt from enron corp. 's plummeting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign tuesday as the energy giant 's chief executive officer after only about six months in the job .
on tuesday , mr. skilling insisted he had resigned for " personal reasons " unrelated to enron 's business activities .
in the interview , he reiterated that he was n't under any pressure to resign from the company 's board or chairman kenneth lay , who has resumed the ceo 's duties at the nation 's biggest energy trader .
however , yesterday mr. skilling said that his " personal reasons " were deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business area during his brief tenure as ceo .
mr. skilling , who had been at enron 11 years , said the depressed stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow enron employees , many of whom are shareholders .

price insiders say manipulation also strained equipment christian berthelsen , scott winokur , chronicle staff writers sunday , may 20 , 2001 , 2001 san francisco chronicle large power companies have driven up electricity prices in california by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages , according to dozens of interviews with regulators , lawyers and energy industry workers .
otherwise , why would they do that ?
according to the accounts of three plant operators , reliant 's operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease , then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt etiwanda plant .
this happened as many as four or five times an hour .
the workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market .
they and other power companies , including aes corp. and a partnership between nrg energy inc. and dynegy inc. , have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging , decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet california 's needs .
while acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every 10 minutes , company officials said it was done at the instructions of the iso to maintain supply - demand balance .
frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which reliant schedulers in houston ordered dispatch changes without the iso directing them to do it first .
iso was not calling reliant every 10 minutes for that , " said one of the operators .
when power companies bid on hourly contracts , they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour .
a computer analysis by the chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day period shows reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns .
plants owned by reliant , aes , mirant corp. and duke energy inc. accounted for more than half of the state 's unplanned shutdowns , even though their generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state 's total capacity from all sources .
reliant , one of california 's largest and most profitable out - of - state generators , reported 319 shutdowns during the period in march and april .
reliant 's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 megawatts over the 40-day period , an average of 1,368 per day - enough power for 1.4 million homes for one hour .
but the operators said the issue is not so clear - cut .
rampant sources say reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice .
one way to obtain those high prices , the plant workers said , was the simple method of demanding a sky - high price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met .
on one occasion , one operator said , reliant ordered a unit at etiwanda to be shut off because the iso would not meet the price of $ 1,000 per megawatt hour , even though the legal price cap at the time was $ 750 .
also , always avoid annoying alliteration .

for all the deal flow these days , it 's suddenly become apparent that many people are n't entirely sure what it is they 've been trading :
is this a product that is supposed to pay off on credit impairment , or is it a product intended to protect capital in case of a cataclysmic inability to recover ones principal ?
although delivery is typically based on physical settlement of loans or bonds at their par value , contracts are sometimes written for cash settlement of par value minus any recovery from the sale of the asset .
there are increasing pressures on banks to mark loans to market , and when a loan is restructured , it is clearly a loss of value - often a step taken just to avoid an immediate default , " explains hetty harlan , a managing director in charge of credit derivatives trading for bofa 's portfolio management group .
harlan thus considers structurings " de facto " or " prepackaged " defaults and a legitimate credit event under standard isda document .
and if people do n't recognize it as such , what 's the point of buying credit protection in the first place ?

for example , cellular phone fees of cellular phone companies are billed to the enduser by its local phone company as a separate line item and are not included in its gross receipts .
the marketer 's logic appears to be that since they did not receive the invoiced amount directly they do not have to pay gross receipts taxes on the amounts collected by the producer but would only have to pay on the net amount .
we reviewed the documentation used by the marketer and reviewed the legal and tax issues with outside counsel and our tax advisors and came to the conclusion that the methodology used by this marketer is not legally sufficient to avoid the tax liability .
such operational netting does not change the fact that legally the marketer is deemed to have received the full gross amount from the enduser even if they did not physically receive the invoiced amounts .
the marketer 's documentation i reviewed was , while internally inconsistent and vague , legally insufficient to actually result in an assignment of the obligation to deliver gas to the producer which would have been the only way to allow the marketer to avoid the gross receipts tax .
the fact that ypf agrees to invoice third parties adds nothing to bolster the merits of the marketer 's scheme .
there is no tax or legal liability assumed by ypf or any other producer for agreeing to bill third parties so there is no risk for the producer to do so and no tax scheme endorsement can be argued .
the tax law is clearly based on gross receipts not net receipts and our counsel and tax advisors tell us that this scheme does not result in the marketer being able to legally declare its net receipts as its gross receipts .

las vegas sun : statistics point to more than random error in florida vote
: gore might lose a second round : media suppressed the bush vote 6 chicago sun times : how democrats steal elections 1 court upholds florida vote deadline the associated press tuesday , nov. 14 , 2000 ; 1:04 p.m. est tallahassee , fla. --
a florida judge ruled tuesday that state officials may cut off the vote recount in the state 's fiercely contested presidential election at 5 p.m. est .
they believe the american people are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts and recounts until one side achieves the results it seeks .
in fact , the gore campaign specifically selected overwhelmingly democratic precincts in these counties to recount .
and yesterday , the florida secretary of state reiterated that florida law unambiguously requires every canvassing board to certify its election returns by 5:00pm today .
that 's why today secretary james a. baker offered the following common sense proposal to solve the impasse : governor bush has objected to the manual recount .
economics professor tom carroll began running statistical equations thursday on the net gains both gore , who gained more than 2,200 votes , and texas gov. george w. bush , who added about 700 votes , have made in the recount .
with florida 's election results so close , charges of voter confusion and intimidation fill the air .
because of the closeness of the race , problems that have been ignored in the past are difficult to ignore now .
heavily republican duval county apparently had over 25,000 similarly spoiled ballots .
buchanan 's votes are actually not an anomaly .
with 16,695 registered members of the american reform , reform and independent parties , palm beach is a hotbed of reform party activity .
by prematurely declaring gore the winner shortly before polls had closed in florida 's conservative western panhandle , the media ended up suppressing the republican vote .
city and suburban officials said 122,859 of the 1,987,954 people who cast ballots in the county either did not punch a choice in the top contest or spoiled their ballot for that race by punching more than one hole .

this is n't the first time that nhtsa has failed its mission , argues michael i. krauss , law professor at george mason university and author of the recent independent institute book fire and smoke : government , lawsuits and the rule of law .
nhtsa , the agency responsible for minimum fuel economy standards ( found by a court to have likely cost many lives by forcing manufacturers to produce light , dangerous cars ) and for illegal - to - disable , baby - killing airbags , does not deserve to be rewarded for its asleep - at - the - switch approach to the tire problem , " krauss wrote recently .
however , when nhtsa fails , self - proclaimed " consumer advocates " call for a parallel absurdity : lavishing the agency with more regulatory authority and taxpayer funds .
in this light , perhaps what most needs to be recalled and held accountable for sloppy workmanship and false advertising is : the defective regulatory state .

( the independent institute , 2000 ) , see paul craig roberts on the war on crime election - year promises always renew the risk that peaceful americans will see their rights sacrificed for the sake of political expediency .
although one " anti - crime " bill ( or " anti - privacy " according to its critics ) was recently defeated , another " anti - crime " bill -- this one strengthening asset forfeiture laws -- has just been introduced .
unfortunately , says roberts , asset forfeiture laws violate due process and are any easy way for politicians to look " tough on crime " even though such laws harm innocent americans far more than criminals .
the house judiciary committee led by henry hyde , r - ill . , has documented the most extraordinary abuses of the asset forfeiture laws , " writes roberts .
privatization and community in criminal justice , by bruce benson , at medicare reform :
this omission , which has stalled any genuine reform of medicare , is largely the fault of economists , says economist robert b. helms in the new issue of the independent review .
my criticism is not directed to the economists who have attempted for many years to apply market principles to health - care issues , but to the larger number of economists who have not , " helms writes .
moreover , my criticism pertains to the failure of economists to teach the fundamental principles of economics to educated americans , rather than to the failure of ' economics . '
without a concerted effort to impart these principles to a wider audience , helms argues , medicare reform -- and other necessary health - policy reforms -- will become victim of political maneuvering , much to the detriment of the lives and well - being of the american public .
this lack of education in economics is appallingly evident in washington , d.c. , especially on capitol hill , " says helms .

your act trenton - former governor christine todd whitman has had plenty to say about republican gubernatorial candidate bret schundler .
the bloom was off the rose by december 21 , 1995 , when governor whitman told schundler she planned to block his attempts to enact a payroll tax in jersey city because it was a really bad idea :
a court ruled his tax was illegal and ordered him to refund jersey city businesses the $ 2.85 million he had improperly collected .
schundler waged a court battle for two years to defend his illegal tax for two years , until the state supreme court finally turned him down .
by late 1999 , governor whitman took the gloves off and took her anti - schundler message directly to the people of jersey city .
[ letter from gov. whitman to jersey city residents , 11/24/99 , attached ] whitman administration accuses schundler of wrong doing when whitman put her key advisor , dca commissioner jane kenny , on the schundler attack , it got even worse : *

pg&e transmissions deal one thing that is still uncertain is
the principal concern on the price front is that pg&e wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit .
there is no way pg&e will get more than that , whatever they think , " according to the leader of one main consumer groups .

what are we still waiting on from them ?
this is the story of the night my ten - year - old cat , rudy , got his head stuck in the garbage disposal .
getting him out was n't easy , though , and the process included numerous home remedies , a plumber , two cops , an emergency overnight veterinary clinic , a case of mistaken identity , five hours of panic , and fifteen minutes of fame .
bill had just ground up the skin of some smoked salmon in the garbage disposal , and when he left the room , rudy ( whom we always did call a pinhead ) had gone in after it .
this is an animal that i have slept with nightly for ten years , who burrows under the covers and purrs against my side , and who now looked like a desperate , fur - covered turkey carcass , set to defrost in the sink while it 's still alive and kicking .
it was also disturbing to see bill , mr. calm - in - any - emergency , at his wits end , trying to soothe rudy , trying to undo the garbage disposal , failing at both , and basically freaking out .
i called the 1 - 800 number for insinkerator ( no response ) , a pest removal service that advertises 24-hour service ( no response ) , an all - night emergency veterinary clinic ( who had no experience in this matter , and so , no advice ) , and finally , in desperation , 911 .
i 'm from the sixties , and even if i am currently a fine upstanding citizen , i had never considered calling the cops and asking them to come to my house , on purpose .
they were , of course , quite astonished by the situation : " i 've never seen anything like this , " officer mike kept saying .
you know , " he said , " i think the reason we ca n't get him out is the angle of his head and body .
the sink was lifted gently out of the countertop , with one guy holding the garbage disposal ( which contained rudy 's head ) up close to the sink ( which contained rudy 's body ) .
instead , my sweet , gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger , hard , really hard and would n't let go .
the cop , who was not mike , rolled down his window and asked , " why are you following me ?
once bill and i recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked , led us quickly to the emergency vet , where mike greeted us by holding open the door , exclaiming , " where were you guys ?
they took his temperature ( which was down 10-degrees ) and his oxygen level ( which was half of normal ) , and the vet declared : " this cat is in serious shock .
they laid rudy on a cart , where one person hooked up iv fluids , another put little socks on his paws ( " you 'd be amazed how much heat they lose through their pads , " she said ) , one covered him with hot water bottles and a blanket , and another took a blow - dryer to warm up rudy 's now very gunky head .
the fur on his head dried in stiff little spikes , making him look rather pathetically punk as he lay there , limp and motionless .
i told mike he did n't have to stay , but he just stood there , shaking his head .
mr. huskey had somehow inferred that i called 911 because i thought bill , my husband , was going into shock , although how he concluded this from my comment that his pads were turning blue , i do n't quite understand .
when i called a tree surgeon about my dying red oak , he asked if i knew the person on that street whose cat had been in the garbage disposal .
and when i went to get my hair cut , the shampoo person told me the funny story her grandma had read in the paper , about a cat that got stuck in the garbage disposal .

the average price of electricity on the now - defunct power exchange soared to $ 120 per megawatt hour in june , five times higher than the same month the previous year , and remained roughly at that level until skyrocketing to $ 377 in december .
the executive director of a san diego consumers group , the utility consumers ' action network , thinks the generators and the marketers of power , using sophisticated computer methods , learned something as the heat wave drove up the demand for power .
the former iso chairman , who represents generators , cited an iso report attributing the price increase last may to the heat wave , power plant outages , less hydroelectric power and higher prices for the natural gas used by power plants .
why power prices remained at high levels and even soared last winter , instead of dropping as usual , is more difficult to explain .
staff and wire services body : ? ?
california stepped up its war on the power industry thursday as state legislators offered to pay millions of dollars to " bounty hunters " who provide information leading to the arrest and conviction of energy executives and others who manipulate the electricity market . ? ? ?
california " is being plundered by an energy cartel , " said lt . gov. cruz bustamente , who is promoting a bill that would level criminal penalties for exploiting energy markets . ?
if what they are doing is n't illegal , it ought to be . " ? ? ?
bustamente was one of a crowd of state leaders who went before microphones . ? ? ?
on the floor of the assembly , speaker bob hertzberg , d - van nuys , rallied his democratic colleagues behind a bill to create a state power authority with equally blistering attacks on private power suppliers . ? ? ?
but after thursday 's hearing before a senate committee formed to investigate alleged price - fixing in the energy market , committee chairman joe dunn , d - garden grove , told a reporter : " i 've never seen this much smoke when there was n't a fire . " ? ? ?
power generators insist they are operating fairly and say there is no evidence of them acting outside the law . ? ? ?
jan smutny - jones , executive director of the independent energy producers association , dismissed the harsh rhetoric as unproductive .
putting people in prison is n't going to encourage more generation , " smutny - jones said , warning that the political posturing would make energy generators think twice about investing in california . ? ? ?
also on thursday , experts said federally ordered caps on wholesale electricity prices wo n't necessarily mean california will escape rolling blackouts this summer .
santa clara county agreed thursday to join a lawsuit against power suppliers , alleging they conspired to raise prices and boost profits while subjecting consumers to higher bills and rolling blackouts . ? ?
the suit seeks refunds for consumers of more than $ 1 billion in alleged excess electricity profits . ? ?
we looked at the evidence on which those allegations were grounded and found they were indeed supported by the evidence , expert and otherwise . " ? ?
the suit names a dozen electricity generating and marketing companies , including duke energy and enron energy marketing . ? ?
similar claims have been filed by three water districts in the san diego area , and two class - action lawsuits by private attorneys on behalf of consumers are pending against power suppliers . ? ?
the companies have vigorously denied the charges . ? ?
i do n't think there will be any evidence of illegal activity by anyone , " said jan smutny - jones , executive director of the independent energy producers association , when asked about various government probes . ? ?
the surcharge idea faces stiff opposition from some state officials , one of whom said it amounts to an " unwarranted intrusion " into state jurisdiction .

there are some retired pg&e employees and officers , including at least one of the company 's former chief executive officers . ? ?

pg&e spokesman ron low said the list includes everyone to whom the utility wrote a check in the last two years , such as homeowners who received energy conservation rebates and retirees who received checks related to benefits . ? ?
it was an attempt to notify anybody who possibly could have a claim against the company and to cast the widest net possible , " he said . ? ?
several pg&e retirees , such as robert w. oliver of berkeley , were baffled by their inclusion on the list .
another retiree on the list is former chief executive richard a. clarke . ? ?
he and about 10 other former high - ranking pg&e executives or their survivors have retained an attorney to help ensure that their retirement benefits are protected during the bankruptcy case . ? ?
hansen said some retired executives have deferred - compensation packages that might be considered a general unsecured bankruptcy claim . ? ?
one concern , he said , is that pg&e chairman robert d. glynn jr. wrote recently in a san francisco chronicle op - ed article that health care plans and other benefits " for employees and most retirees " will continue . ? ?
that means their claims will be handled in bankruptcy court with those of other unsecured creditors whose debts are not backed by utility assets . ? ?
the firm replaces keys and locks for pg&e offices and trucks . ? ?
many businesses and individuals said they had no idea why the company believes it owes them money . ? ?
a number of vendors said pg&e 's account is paid up . ? ?
many creditors are health clubs and health care providers : medical and dental offices , foot and joint specialists , pharmacies , chiropractors . ? ?
then executive director bonnie dettmer came to the line . ? ?
i would bet they belong to every chamber of commerce . " ? ?
one creditor is the state agency that pg&e says drove the company into insolvency by not allowing full recovery of its wholesale power costs . ? ?
and republicans are beginning to demand that the state spend billions in general tax money to cushion electricity rate hikes of up to 40 % being imposed on consumers and businesses . ? ?
even before summer temperatures hit , sacramento shelled out $ 90 million to buy electricity in a single day last week . ? ?
but even as budget writers were exhaling , the payments merely offered proof that the economy was strong last year , back when then - president bill clinton was heralding the longest period of economic growth in u.s. history , and californians ' lexicon did not include the term " rolling blackout . " ? ?
the bond debt would be paid off over a period of perhaps 15 years . ? ?
republican legislators are balking at the idea . ? ?
that will be a de facto tax cut , " said senate republican leader jim brulte of rancho cucamonga .
in recent years , legislators have grown used to the multibillion - dollar windfalls of tax payments , which allowed them to deliver new swimming pools , school programs , museums , parks , social and health care spending , and tax cuts to their constituents .
indeed , the budget in davis ' first two years grew 37 % , even as the democratic governor and legislators cut taxes by $ 3.9 billion . ? ?
jean ross of the california budget project , a private budget watchdog and advocacy group , said davis and legislators not only must pay attention to the economy . ? ?
he wo n't reveal those decisions until he releases his revised spending plan .
839 words headline : commentary ; will the ferc see the light on the law ?
frank a. wolak , an economics professor at stanford university , is , chairman of the market surveillance committee of the california , independent system operator body : ? ?
they are , claim many observers , exercising their market power to raise wholesale electricity prices . ? ?
although it is not illegal under california or u.s. antitrust law for a firm to exercise its market power , it is illegal to do so under the federal power act .
the federal energy regulatory commission , or ferc , which regulates the california wholesale electricity market , is the entity charged with enforcing this law .
in 1935 , congress passed the federal power act and required the federal power commission ( the predecessor to ferc ) to set " just and reasonable " wholesale electricity prices .
moreover , if the ferc finds that wholesale electricity prices are unjust and unreasonable , the federal power act gives it wide - ranging discretion to take actions that result in just and reasonable prices .
however , there is no guarantee that market prices meet the just and reasonable standard required by the federal power act .
in such a circumstance , the price set by the market satisfies the just and reasonable standard of the federal power act . ? ?
in other words , each market participant must submit sworn testimony to the ferc demonstrating it does not have the ability to raise market prices and profit from this behavior . ? ?
the events of the past 10 months have demonstrated that contrary to their filings stating otherwise , all of the out - of - state generators possess significant market power . ? ?
moreover , in its dec. 15 , 2000 report on the california electricity market , the ferc concluded that wholesale electricity prices during the summer and autumn of 2000 were unjust and unreasonable and reflected the exercise of significant market power . ? ?
fortunately for california consumers , the california public utilities commission and gov. gray davis refused to be accomplices in the ferc 's decision not to enforce the federal power act .
they refused to pass on to california consumers prices that the ferc itself had determined were unjust and unreasonable . ? ?
it has before it several proposals that would enforce all provisions of the federal power act .
its owner is not byline : ?
still , such transfers of assets were fundamental to deregulation plans in two dozen states , and they were encouraged by federal rules designed to build a new wholesale marketplace in electricity . ? ?
and today , the offspring of the nation 's utilities dominate that market , after industry leader enron . ?
eight of the nation 's 10 largest power marketers are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities , controlling about 42 percent of power trading . ? ?
it is largely these unregulated power producers and traders whose sales of power in california have prompted accusations by state leaders of price gouging , and demands for the price caps that federal regulators took their first , halting steps toward embracing last week . ? ?
the profitability of the utilities ' unregulated operations is becoming clear as companies report earnings for the first three months of the year . ? ?
and the california public utilities commission is investigating whether pg & e and edison international , whose southern california edison utility unit is also near insolvency , have improperly transferred cash to their parents and to unregulated sister companies . ? ?
southern california edison transferred $ 4.8 billion to its parent company between 1996 and november 2000 , a separate audit showed ; edison international invested $ 2.5 billion in its unregulated mission group subsidiaries during the same period . ? ?
audits have shown that " we followed the rules and did n't do anything wrong , " said pg & e 's chief executive , robert glynn .
mr. glynn said that pg & e had done nothing wrong and that the company has responded to justice department requests for information . ? ?
to wall street , the utility companies ' investments in unregulated businesses were a necessary survival tactic , as investors demanded faster - growing profits . ? ?
separately , in 1999 , the utility agreed to pay about $ 29 million to settle charges that consumers were endangered because it failed to trim trees near high - voltage power lines . ? ?
several hundred million dollars did n't get spent for maintenance , and that ultimately falls to the bottom line as profit , " mr. florio said . ? ?
glynn said the utility had always spent appropriate sums on maintenance , coming within one - half of one percent of the amount built into rates over a 20-year period . ? ?
newsmaker profile ; nettie hoge ; taking on power ; consumer advocate revels in uphill battle source :
given a choice , nettie hoge would rather be out in her garden right about now , digging in the dirt . ? ? ?
instead , the head of the utility reform network is digging into california 's energy mess , making sure the average joe does n't take it in the kisser as lawmakers , regulators and utility brass hats try to keep the lights on and utilities afloat . ? ? ?
they are , in short , professional gadflies who represent the public in a system that some say favors big business . ? ? ?
the biggest protector of the consumer , by far , has been turn , " said bob gnaizda , public policy director for the greenlining institute in san francisco .
( hoge ) has made turn into the leading consumer utility advocate in the nation . " ? ? ?
and , truth be told , most folks have no idea
the youngest of four children , hoge bounced around the middle of the country as she grew up , following her career army officer father from kansas to oklahoma to texas . ? ? ?
all the places where you can shoot big guns , " she joked . ? ? ?
wash. after a stint at the university of southern california , she graduated phi beta kappa from washington state university and earned a law degree from the university of san francisco . ? ? ?
they include persuading the public utilities commission to create a $ 352 million fund to underwrite rural telephone service and bringing an end to ratepayer subsidies of pg&e 's diablo canyon nuclear power plant in 2002 . ? ? ?
hoge , a stickler for detail , has a reputation for giving exhaustive answers to even mundane questions . ? ? ?
everybody agrees she knows what she 's talking about , " said harvey rosenfield , president of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights .
those of us who are deeply involved in this issue rely upon nettie to lay out the facts for us . " ? ? ?
hoge is surprised people think her wonkish , but admits she is circumspect . ? ? ?
it was the same story with southern california edison and many of the legislators who have criticized hoge and turn in recent years . ? ? ?
hoge is n't surprised her adversaries are keeping mum . ? ? ?
there 's nothing for them to gain by saying anything negative about us because the public is on our side , " she said . ? ? ?
still , turn has drawn criticism from carl wood , generally considered the most ardent consumer advocate on the puc . ? ? ?
and he said hoge places too much emphasis on the utilities ' role in the energy mess instead of focusing on the profiteering of power generators . ? ? ?
the utilities have some culpability , but they are not the main driver behind the crisis , " wood said .
still , he gave turn high marks and credited hoge with making it a far more effective advocate . ? ? ?
hoge admits she has had her hands full with the energy crisis , saying she and her staff " are trying to keep our health and sanity .
still , hoge does n't plan to give up the fight anytime soon . ? ? ?

bachelor 's degree in communications , phi beta kappa , from washington state university , 1976 .
the rest of the united states is virtually certain to escape rolling blackouts this summer like the ones that have plagued california , but record price hikes for electricity are likely in many places , energy experts agree . ? ? ?
despite their confidence that they can survive everything but an extremely hot summer without power outages , managers of the nation 's interconnecting electrical power grids are anxiously awaiting new power plants that are scheduled to come on - line .
they are also promoting more frugal consumption by power customers and seeking ways to avoid distribution logjams during peak demand periods this summer . ? ? ?
that leaves parts of the nation vulnerable to outages if there are prolonged heat waves this summer , or if utilities are unable to start up new or rebuilt gas - fired power plants as scheduled , according to energy experts . ? ? ?
despite all those potential problems , there is no reason to believe that california 's power nightmares will spread to the rest of the country , officials said . ? ? ?
california , in a sense , has been serving as a stalking horse for other states , some of which also deregulated their electricity systems and are consciously avoiding doing anything that resembles the california model . ? ? ?
apart from california , the worst problems are expected in adjoining western states , as golden state electrical grid managers scramble to buy electricity at a time when power production at the region 's hydroelectric dams is already being cut because of shrinking water levels in reservoirs . ? ? ?
but in interviews , officials of many of the 10 regional reliability councils that comprise the national grid system appeared fairly sanguine about the prospect of avoiding widespread brownouts this summer . ? ? ?
assuming normal weather and assuming our generating units come off maintenance on schedule , we do n't anticipate any particular problems meeting our loads , " said bill reinke , executive director of the southeastern electricity reliability council . ? ? ?
residents and conservationists are appealing court approval of the generators on environmental grounds . ? ? ?
harris cited several reasons " why we are not like california , " including a decision to centralize all planning , which california did not ; the creation of a regional market instead of a state - based marketplace like california 's , and a policy of only slow , incremental changes in the grid . ? ? ?
but keeping pace with the nearly 6 percent increase in demand is the addition of 5,470 megawatts of capacity , bulley said . ? ? ?
although no one expects all of that to come on - line , the state 's total generating capacity is just under 34,000 megawatts , meaning that even if only a modest amount of the anticipated power was added , the region would have a cushion , even in a hot summer . ? ? ?
the materials in the ap file were compiled by the associated press . ?
by the associated press body : ? ?
- members of the assembly subcommittee on natural gas costs and availability unveil legislation to cut natural gas prices . ?
the state remains free of power alerts as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent . ? ?
one megawatt is roughly enough power for 750 homes . ? ?

-the state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent . ? ?
electricity and natural gas suppliers , scared off by the two companies ' poor credit ratings , are refusing to sell to them , leading the state in january to start buying power for the utilities ' nearly 9 million residential and business customers .
the 350-degree steam rushes more than 1,500 feet up from the earth , spinning turbines that create a constant flow of electricity . ? ?
the geothermal decline comes as california already faces short supplies of hydroelectricity from the drought - ridden pacific northwest and growing competition for megawatts from other power - starved states . ? ?
the plants ' cooling towers release plumes of white steam , which can be seen for miles on a clear day . ? ?
the water and the condensed steam is pumped back into the earth . ? ?
geothermal energy is second only to hydroelectricity as a continuous , cheap source of power , said jan stewart , calpine 's public relations manager . ? ?
in the 1960s and ' 70s when the geysers got started , there was ' ' a real wildcatter 's mentality ' ' among power generators , said rich ferguson , energy chairman for sierra club california . ? ? '
basically , they took out the water in the form of steam faster than mother nature was putting it back in , ' ' he said . ? ?
it began three years ago , when lake county stopped pumping its treated waste water into clear lake . ? ?
now , more than 8 million gallons of treated waste water is returned daily to the earth .
calpine is building a 50-mile pipeline to santa rosa and plans to pump another 11 million of treated waste water daily from that city .
only one engineer staffs each of the 19 calpine plants in the geysers . ? ?
' many of these sites were looked at in the ' 80s , but then nothing happened because in the ' 90s natural gas was too cheap to meter , ' ' he said . ? ?
ferguson said the state spent $ 540 million over the last four years on incentives for renewable energy projects , including geothermal , solar , wind and biomass , and he expects the plan will be renewed when it expires in december . ? ? ' '
steam from the earth is piped to the power plant , where it spins turbines to create electricity .
after the remaining steam condenses back to liquid , it is returned to the earth . ? ? ?
the water is returned to the earth as is the condensed steam . ? ? ?
backers of a bill to prevent holders of concealed handgun licenses from bringing their weapons onto school property will spend the coming week trying to force a senate vote on the issue . ? ?
the guns - in - schools bill has been on life support for weeks , with a key senate committee chairman refusing to schedule a hearing on the bill on grounds that it is overly contentious and would n't pass anyway . ? ?
gun owner groups say sb508 is unnecessary because there have been no documented cases of law - abiding carriers of concealed handguns causing any problems at schools . ? ?
i do n't think we should wait to have dead children before we ban guns in schools , " said burdick , who was a chief sponsor of a measure passed by voters last fall expanding background checks at gun shows . ? ?
still , simmons says that drought conditions and the power market turmoil caused by california 's energy crisis require reconsideration of the law . ? ?
for that reason , the house speaker is planning hearings this week on his proposal to enact a 15-month delay in oregon 's electricity restructuring efforts . ? ?
because of its botched deregulation attempts , california bears a lot of the blame - but not all of it , said susan f. tierney , a former assistant secretary in the energy department , now a consultant for lexecon , a cambridge , mass. , consulting firm . ? ?
so they sold off their power plants and bought power on the wholesale market , where it was cheap and plentiful . ? ?
when wholesale power prices went up , they could n't pass those increases on to consumers . ? ?
at the time , they did not realize that in a couple of years there would not be an adequate power supply , " tierney said . ? ?
the internet , with all its server farms and data hotels , also became a heavy power user . ? ?
because demand is so high this year , generators can charge exorbitant prices , knowing that california and the northwest have nowhere else to buy power . ? ?
why is los angeles an island of tranquillity in the electric - power crisis that has rocked california and threatens to spread across the nation ? ? ?
by staying clear of the state 's 1996 deregulation scheme for private utilities , the department of water and power was able to hold onto its power plants . ? ?
but when we ask how los angeles came to enjoy public power in the first place , the answer commonly given makes a hash of history . ? ?
meyer lissner , a reform attorney often portrayed as a champion of public power , opposed the holding of a decisive 1911 citywide straw poll on the subject because he knew most angelenos would cast their ballots for municipal ownership .
the most steadfast partisans of public power were not progressive reformers like lissner but the city 's much - maligned labor unions , and for a simple reason .
without organized labor 's dogged campaign for " gas and water socialism , " as well as its willingness to hand control of these resources to the anti - union regimes of mayors george alexander and henry rose , there would be no dwp today . ? ?
from that day on , l.a. 's unions never wavered in their call for a public water supply publicly managed .
the aqueduct was the sine qua non of public power .
at a time when most progressive reformers were mute on the subject , organized labor insisted that the aqueduct be used to generate electricity for the city 's streets , homes and businesses . ? ?
a broad consensus backed the city 's construction of hydroelectric plants while the aqueduct was being built , but most of the city 's politicians and corporate lobbyists were committed to public subsidies , not public ownership , of aqueduct power .
the 1911 straw poll , in which city voters declared their support for municipal ownership and distribution of owens river power , upset their plans . ? ?
the most consistent fighters for public power during the decades after the straw poll were the central labor council , international brotherhood of electrical workers , other unions and city employees who stuffed campaign envelopes , canvassed precincts and got out the vote .
voters who favored municipally owned power and initiatives bolstering the dwp tended to be working class and democratic ; those opposed were mainly middle and upper class and republican . ? ?
in this polarized political climate , mayor alexander called for a $ 6.5-million bond issue to complete the aqueduct - power distribution network ; he left open the question of who would sell the power to consumers .
wheeler led a successful fight against an attempt to split the power - bond issue into two separate ballot propositions , one to complete the aqueduct 's generating stations , the other to create a city - owned distribution system .
such a division would probably have doomed public power . ? ?
the large majority of unionists who favored public power had little time to savor wheeler 's victory .
while pressing the attack on the three electric companies , they faced a small but angry split in their own ranks .
dissenters in the building trades council and a few of its unions argued that labor 's grievances against the progressive regimes of 1909 - 14 had turned the argument for municipal ownership on its head .
what good was municipal ownership in the hands of a council and mayor who had caused the arrest of hundreds of peaceful picketers during the citywide strikes of 1910 , had underpaid aqueduct workers and fed them bad food and had denied unionists influential city jobs ?
was it not folly to reward labor 's foes with control of the aqueduct 's power ? ? ?
on its own , as well as in coalition with other groups , the labor movement marshaled its rank and file on behalf of public power .
the pro - bond unions never did win over the dissenting faction ; rather , they overwhelmed it at the polls .
most people see it only when their own lights go out . ? ?
california has been a pioneer in power conservation , and its citizens will listen to persuasive reasoning . ? ?
she told of one businessman in her district who reported he will lose an estimated $ 30,000 every time his power is cut .
why not at least schedule blackouts so people can plan for them ?
the study did not include the $ 5.1 billion the state has spent so far to buy power for the insolvent private utilities . ? ?
republicans in the legislature are stalling bills that would float a $ 10-billion revenue bond issue to finance power purchases and keep the state fiscally above water .
but davis put the new program on a fast track friday and made a smart choice in s. david freeman , former chief of the los angeles department of water and power , to run the conservation effort . ? ?
so what if president bush has opposed electricity price controls sought by california officials ?
or that he has proposed cutting aid to states for incarcerating illegal immigrants convicted of crimes ?
or that he has visited 26 states in his first 100 days in office -- but not the most populous ? ? ?
the bush administration 's treatment of california started at indifference , moved to neglect and has now reached actual harm , " complained phil schiliro , chief of staff for rep. henry a. waxman ( d - los angeles ) . ? ?
her response from the white house : a form letter with her name misspelled . ? ?
and he provided no money in his proposed budget to clean up a pile of uranium processing waste in utah leaking into the colorado river . ? ?
john j. pitney jr. , associate professor of government at claremont mckenna college , said bush 's apparent indifference makes political sense . ? ?
the 2000 election suggested that he can not carry the state no matter how hard he tries .
but , khachigian said , " there 's a fine line between taking responsibility for a problem and claiming that california is n't part of the united states . " ? ?
in dealing with heavily democratic california , bush has made this much clear : he is no bill clinton . ? ?
and california in return showered him with buckets of campaign dollars and electoral votes . ? ?
his wife already has done so . ? ?
as proof that california is on their mind , administration officials point to the three californians in the cabinet -- ann m. veneman of agriculture , norman y. mineta of transportation and anthony j. principi of veterans affairs -- and others in top white house jobs . ? ?
bush also has appointed california latinos to high - level posts : huntington park councilwoman rosario marin as treasurer , los angeles entrepreneur hector v. barreto jr. as head of the small business administration and former san mateo county supervisor ruben barrales as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs . ? ?
the proposed agriculture budget , for example , provides only $ 5 million -- not the $ 15 million that california lawmakers said they need -- to fight the glassy winged sharpshooter , an agricultural pest that threatens the state 's wine industry . ? ?
his proposed budget includes additional money to crack down on illegal immigration and drug smuggling and unsafe trucks crossing into california from mexico .
steve maviglio , a spokesman for davis , said bush and his aides " got off to a strong start " by extending federal orders sought by the state to keep power flowing into california . ? ?
in a reference to price controls , he added : " they 're skirting around the edges of the problem without taking the bold action they need to take . " ? ?
the feds are the only ones who can step in and bring some sanity to the cost of electricity in california , " thompson said . ? ?
administration officials said they have taken steps " from our first hours in office " to address the energy crisis .
they said they have responded favorably to all the state 's requests except price controls , which bush contends would discourage the building of power plants . ? ?
and even those who support them argue that the issue misses the larger point . ? ?
randy " duke " cunningham ( r - san diego ) , an advocate of price controls , nevertheless said : " i agree with the administration that the state alone remains responsible for solving this crisis . " ? ?
" i do n't believe bush should bear the brunt of responsibility that the clinton administration left over . " ? ?
tim ransdell , executive director of the california institute for federal policy research , doubted that bush would ignore california .
one in eight americans ca n't be ignored .

power crisis zaps state bond rating ; price controls okd :
separately , federal regulators approved a plan to control electricity prices in california during times of supply shortages .
just before the release of the first report , the recording industry assn . of america had blunted some of the criticism by introducing a policy against ads for such albums on tv shows or in publications whose audience is mostly 16 years old or younger .
gas prices continue upward spiral : the average price of self - serve regular gasoline spurted higher again in california and around the nation on an increase in demand and a switch by refiners to the more costly summer gasoline blend required in parts of the country by air - quality regulations .
powell also told broadcasters meeting in las vegas that viacom inc. was likely to prevail in its challenge of federal rules that prevent any broadcaster from owning stations that reach more than 35 % of the nation 's television viewers . ? ?
ford takes more heat over explorer tires : ford motor co. came under the most direct criticism leveled against it yet regarding last year 's massive firestone tire recall .
two prominent consumer safety groups issued a report saying that the auto maker was largely to blame for accidents in which ford explorer sport - utility vehicles , equipped with firestone tires , spun out of control after the tires lost their treads .
american airlines sued over health coverage :
a flight attendant filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission in los angeles , charging that american airlines discriminated against some employees by refusing to offer insurance coverage for birth control , pap tests and infertility treatments .
he just did n't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue ; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee - jerk leftists , who blame greedy capitalists for every problem , be it third - world poverty or high apartment rents .
" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims . ? ?
but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state -- and nobody will believe it . ? ? ?
and even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators . ? ?
the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand .
a rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently -- and very profitably -- short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought to be lots of excess capacity . ? ?
indeed , the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote , with william massey -- the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls -- voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual . ? ?
first , it caps prices only in emergency conditions -- ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no emergency .
in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that it is not . ? ?
second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes , offering extensive opportunities for what mr. wolak calls " megawatt laundering " -- selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for example , the controls do not apply to " imports " from neighboring states ) , then selling it back into the california market .
there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there -- indeed , last fall mr. wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts -- but ferc has ignored all of them . ? ?
the charitable interpretation is that ferc still does n't get it , that it just ca n't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real .
whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the administration have yet to offer california any significant relief . ? ?
and they 'll be spewing the same pollution - only more so , because most are old , with little or no emissions controls . ? ?
and unlike trucks and other vehicles , they 've largely escaped 30 years of air pollution restrictions because they were intended only for emergencies , as when a storm or earthquake knocks out power . ? ?
the hot weather that taxes air conditioners and drains electricity supplies also accelerates the conversion of engine exhaust to ozone gas , the ingredient in smog that inflames airways and impairs breathing . ? ?
on those hot days when we want people to stop driving and doing things that pollute the air , the generators will kick in , and air quality will worsen , " salaver said . ? ?
no one knows how many diesel generators are scattered around the state at hospitals , universities , factories and businesses .
- that 's what it 's like , " said michael scheible , deputy executive officer of the state air resources board , which regulates engines and fuels . ? ?
but in recent months , farmers and manufacturers have pressured regulators to redefine an emergency and allow generators to be used well before a blackout is ordered . ? ?
in addition , california will be losing one of its largest generators of electricity today when one of two units at the diablo canyon nuclear power plant is taken off - line for 35 days of scheduled refueling . ? ?
small businesses , farmers , manufacturers - all are rushing to buy generators before the blackouts hit . ? ?
the bill , however , was blocked by a senate committee , and environmentalists say air districts have already relaxed their rules enough . ? ?
air board studies , she noted , have found that a person 's lifetime cancer risk increases 50 percent if he or she lives near a big diesel generator that runs 250 hours a year . ? ?
the san joaquin valley air pollution control district went even further , allowing businesses to run generators when state power reserves drop to 1.5 percent or when the iso predicts blackouts anywhere in the valley . ? ?
as a result , only 12 of the region 's estimated 5,000 generators are subject to pollution controls . ? ?

why edison , pg&e split on strategy
dale kasler bee staff writer body : ? ?
one utility was more entrepreneurial , accustomed to the rough - and - tumble of free markets - and apparently believed only a radical remedy would cure its ills . ? ?
pg&e , with fewer ties to government and possessed of an independent streak , walked away from davis and straight into u.s. bankruptcy court . ? ?
we now have two models ; it 'll be interesting to see who recovers the quickest , " said mitch wilk , a former puc president who is now an energy consultant in san francisco . ? ?
both utilities were afflicted with the same problem : runaway wholesale electricity costs they were n't able to recover from customers because of a state - mandated rate freeze .
both had been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy since january , when their losses depleted their cash reserves and credit . ? ?
the experience took pg&e out of the cozy world of the regulated monopoly - in which the utility had exclusive rights to its service territory but was subject to state price controls - and into the world of competition . ? ?
while the original deregulation called for the cap on customer prices to end in 2002 , davis was insisting the utility remain regulated for a decade . ? ?
i believe pg&e was in denial , " davis said in an interview with bee editors and reporters . ? ?
rather , what it wanted - and what davis ' negotiator michael peevey agreed to in principle - was to let the utility charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity , said pg&e spokesman ron low . ? ?
the discussions and negotiations broke down because they would not agree to the basic principles that were reached by ( pg&e chairman )
pg&e also became disgusted with a series of puc rulings in late march and early april that it believed would seriously hinder its ability to recover its debts . ? ?
the next morning , with glynn dismissing davis ' speech as " a lot of words , " the utility filed for bankruptcy protection . ? ?
that afternoon , davis called pg&e " selfish " and pointedly went into a negotiating session with john bryson , the chairman and chief executive of edison 's parent edison international . ? ?
although edison had tentatively agreed in february to sell its transmission lines , the deal was n't sewn up and davis was nervous the pg&e bankruptcy would prompt edison 's creditors to " jerk edison into bankruptcy , " davis said last week . ? ?
notably , bryson was president of the puc in the 1970s - when davis was gov. jerry brown 's chief of staff . ? ?
politically savvy , edison is one of the utility industry 's biggest contributors to national political campaigns , and it usually spends more than pg&e on california campaigns .
edison international 's board of directors includes los angeles attorney warren christopher , the former u.s. secretary of state and an elder statesman of the democratic party . ? ?
lawmakers then pressured the iso to make the changes . ? ?
according to industry consultant barbara barkovich , edison figured , why wrestle with the federal government over profits when it simply could raise billions through a cash sale ? ? ?
if edison winds up in bankruptcy court , it " wo n't be punished for it , " day said . ? ?
southern california edison headquarters : rosemead , los angeles county customers : 4.2 million in southern california chairman : john bryson performance : lost $ 1.94 billion in 2000 on revenue of $ 11.72 billion stock ticker symbol : eix ? ?
given the nearly $ 20 billion in power purchase debts that the utilities and the state have accumulated so far , the stubbornly high wholesale prices and other data , it 's not unreasonable to project that californians in private utility areas will see their rates double , or rise even higher . ? ?
gov. gray davis ' popularity has plummeted since he took charge of the crisis , laying waste to his intentions to seek an easy re - election next year as a middle - of - the - road , business - friendly , tough - on - crime education reformer . ? ?
with his popularity waning , davis may be compelled to turn left , shoring up his base by catering to demands of labor unions , environmentalists , trial lawyers and other liberal elements of the democratic party .
here 's a message for pampered and overindulged citizens of the golden state who complain unceasingly about high energy bills and the day - to - day prospect of rolling blackouts : stop whining . ? ? ?
callenbach 's work was a major influence on the alternative energy policies of former gov. jerry brown . ? ? ?
aside from the energy needs of the industry itself , the wealth it generated encouraged avaricious lifestyles that include power - swilling mansions and freeways clogged with monster sport utility vehicles . ? ? ?
as we brace for deregulated electric bills courtesy of the state public utilities commission , imagine what life was like for native americans who lived for millennia in a bounteous bay area without microwaves , waffle irons , air conditioning or 24-cubic - foot refrigerators .
but let 's consider the thought that we may actually be better off without the piles of appliances whose tangle of cords clogs our homes and offices . ? ? ?
smug californians love to point to the state 's ranking as a miserly consumer of energy -- only three other states consume less per capita -- to rebut accusations that we have become greedy energy hogs .
potential benefits extend from the spiritual ( a revival of the conservation ethic ) to the curative ( making the state immune to power - problem overloads ) to the liberating ( throwing off for good our dependence on the texas energy overlords ) . ? ? ?
alan ginsberg of satco products in hayward , who imports from china container - loads of squiggly shaped energy - saving fluorescent bulbs , says , " they 're flying out the door . " ? ? ?
it puts on the agenda of public debate the fundamental question of whether our energy system should be in the hands of giant utilities or run by municipalities or by the state .
it certainly unveiled the greed of out - of - state energy producers who have sucked billions of dollars from california . ? ? ?
the crisis has also made us focus on fundamental flaws in our energy grid , such as the 4,500-megawatt electricity shortage that emerged in the 1990s while we were all reveling in california 's boom times . ? ? ?
if that happens , gov. gray davis might yet confound critics who say his political prospects are sinking faster than you can say " megawatt . " ? ? ?
these days , the biggest challenge in gathering our daily bread is the hunt for a space in the supermarket parking lot . ? ? ?
and the british empire , dependent on raw materials from the colonies , began to collapse when it became too expensive to import goods across oceans . ? ? ?
if we get the message , " the net outcome ( of the energy crisis ) will be a quite profound shift in consciousness in energy conservation , " predicts michael lerner , executive director of commonweal , a health and environmental institute in bolinas . ? ? ?
closer to home , one of former gov. george deukmejian 's first acts was to abolish the office of appropriate technology established by gov. jerry brown to move us away from our dependence on non - renewable fossil fuels . ? ? ?
even record high gasoline prices have done nothing to depress the sales of suvs , which now account for the largest share of automobile and light truck sales ( 20 percent at last count ) . ? ? ?
the installation now puts surplus electricity back into the energy grid , instead of sucking more out of it . ? ? ?
reality is what 's needed for real policy governor : consumers deserve to get real facts from davis .
and everyone involved in the crisis expects blackouts this summer as demands for power soar and supplies dwindle . ? ?
the davis strategy , if there is one , is to continue the state 's massive power purchases while negotiating longer - term and presumably cheaper supply contracts , encourage conservation , help utilities pay off their debts by selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping ratepayers , and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch . ? ?
clearly , davis rushed into the edison deal just three days after pg&e filed bankruptcy , in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latter action , but its provisions are being labeled a " bailout " by critics .
it places only a token financial burden on edison international while guaranteeing the profitability of its utility subsidiary by charging its customers whatever is required to cover its costs and past debts . ? ?
meanwhile , the state is spending -- by davis ' own account -- about $ 70 million a day or $ 2-plus billion a month on spot power purchases , paying roughly five times what consumers are being charged at the retail level .
he said tuesday that davis , who has maintained secrecy on power purchases , must offer a comprehensive and public plan for dealing with the financial squeeze . ? ?
meanwhile , bankers are sending strong signals that the state government is becoming as poor a lending risk as the utilities . ? ?
davis , for some reason , is unwilling to declare this situation the emergency that it is truly becoming -- one that could take a toll of human life if major blackouts shut down air conditioners , respirators and traffic lights .
he insists on issuing his periodic -- and wholly unrealistic -- assurances that things will turn out all right , even declaring to reporters this past tuesday that " we think we 'll have this thing licked by the end of fall . " ? ?
exactly what 's happening , the downside financial and power supply risks , and what 's being done to deal with the looming disaster facing this state . ? ?
it 's time for politicians to treat us as adults who can face reality , not as children to be fed sugarcoated sound bites and slogans . ? ?
part a ; part 1 ; page 19 ; metro desk length : 679 words headline : officials call price stability plan illegal ;
two top state energy officials said friday that a federal plan to stabilize electricity prices in california could increase the odds of blackouts this summer and most likely is illegal . ? ?
in a barrage of complaints attacking the federal energy regulatory commission , the state 's top power regulator and the head of the board overseeing california 's transmission grid said they might challenge the federal order in court . ? ?
the order was approved on a 2 - 1 vote wednesday and released to the public late thursday . ? ?
we 're going to take whatever actions we can to oppose this to the extent our lawyers tell us it 's illegal , " said michael kahn , an attorney named by gov. gray davis to head the board overseeing the california independent system operator .
in a conference call with reporters , kahn and loretta lynch , president of the california public utilities commission , said the order also seems to indicate that ferc is unwilling to force power sellers to rebate any of the extraordinary profits earned before last october in california 's market , where wholesale electricity prices began soaring last may. ? ?
and , according to kahn , the federal order illegally ties limits on power prices to a requirement that california link its transmission grid with those of other states . ? ?
lynch and kahn said they do not believe it will bring down power costs or help the state avoid blackouts , as intended . ? ?
they 're creating a whole new , wholesale blackout system , " said lynch , referring to a section of the order that allows large customers , such as steel mills and food processors , to get paid to shut down when grid operators are struggling to find enough electricity to meet demand . ? ?
though a somewhat similar program has helped california avoid blackouts , the federal order requires state power buyers to name the price to which electricity must rise before they shut down customers . ? ?
the requirement of naming a price could lead to more blackouts , said stanford university economist frank wolak , because it prevents power buyers from paying more if that 's what it takes to keep electricity flowing . ? ?
lynch said that no matter how this aspect of the ferc order unfolds , " it ai n't for washington bureaucrats to decide when the lights go out in california . " ? ?
when cal - iso can not find enough power , it must order southern california edison , pacific gas & electric and san diego gas & electric to trigger rotating blackouts . ? ?
the proposal by republican rep. joe barton , the influential chairman of the house energy and air quality subcommittee , would permit producers of alternative and renewable energy to suspend their contracts with the state 's two biggest investor - owned utilities and sell their supplies to a third party . ? ?
meanwhile , the utilities would regain their financial footing by selling assets to the state in exchange for being allowed to recover a portion of their back debt through a surcharge on electricity bills . ? ?
added stephen e. frank , chairman , president and chief executive of southern california edison : " releasing them from their contractual obligations will simply exacerbate the problem , because they would then be selling into the market at additionally higher rates and just compound the state 's problems . " ? ?
if 3,000 megawatts are made available again , it will have a potentially profound effect on what people pay for power by bolstering overall electricity supplies , " peters said . ? ?
utility executives contend that only 1,200 megawatts are offline because of payment problems . ? ?
they differ from their big out - of - state counterparts , which have been getting paid by the state . ? ?
the provisions dealing with waivers of environmental rules have been among the most controversial , drawing opposition from environmentalists . ? ?
the puc told edison and sdg&e to begin listing on electricity bills by june 1 the " outage block " into which each customer falls . ?
carrie peyton bee staff writer body : ? ?
this is an opportunity that shall never come again , " the former culver city mayor told city and county officials gathered this week in sacramento . ? ?
every rate hike , every blackout , every corporate bonus is more evidence for believers that it 's time for local government to get into the power business .
more commonly , cities - including davis , lincoln and culver city - have studied the idea and rejected it , at least temporarily . ? ?
they all face the same question , said santa rosa city manager jeffrey kolin : ? ?
kolin 's city , like scores of others across the state , has decided it is time to study the issue anew , motivated by the prospect of soaring electric bills , repeated blackouts , and pacific gas and electric co. 's bankruptcy filing . ? ?
all their citizens are screaming , " said yvonne hunter , a lobbyist for the league of california cities . ? ?
an effort in the far north state to create a multicounty public power agency was rejected by state regulators because some local governments objected . ? ?
one of the things this crisis has proved is the value of local control , " said jerry jordan , head of the california municipal utilities association . ? ?
the county of san diego is trying to get special legislative authority to create a regional power agency without a popular vote . ? ?
pg&e contends that the factors that once made public power attractive - such as access to low - cost electricity from federal dams - have evaporated . ? ?
with so many unknowns , the next few years are likelier to produce more studies than new utilities , said a number of city officials who attended a seminar in sacramento this week , sponsored in part by the american public power association . ? ?
former new york state sen. al coppola told the group the session should have been titled : " independence from the greedy robber baron utilities . " ? ?
public power backers share three key beliefs : ? ?
they can charge customers less because they do n't have to pay dividends to investors or pay taxes on their sales ; they can respond to local preferences on issues like which customers pay the lowest rates and how blackouts are staged ; and existing utilities will do everything in their power to oppose them . ? ?
edison did the right thing - ( use ) fear , " to discourage culver city from creating an electric arm in 1995 , vera , the city 's former mayor , told the group . ? ?
pg&e sees new utilities as " competition for our business , " and it has a policy of lobbying hard against them , nelson said . ? ?
less than 18 months ago , it warned residents of the placer county town of lincoln that a city power enterprise would be costlier and less dependable than pg&e , and its officials labeled the effort a " tax dodge . " ? ?
but by january of this year , pg&e barely blinked when hercules set up a utility to deliver power and telecommunications service in new neighborhoods . ? ?
we got more resistance from at&t and pacbell , " said raj pankhania , assistant to the city manager of hercules . ? ?
hercules ' plans calls for the older two - thirds of its homes and businesses to retain their pg&e service and the newest third to be served by the city utility . ? ?

soon , a davis confederate ushers four men in 10-gallon hats into an office , shots ring out , and the aide , emerging blood - spattered , delivers the punch - line : " tell the governor his reliant problem is solved .
this is not a power grab , " the democratic governor says in an interview .
yet in the past six months , pushed by what he calls the " colossal failure " of a deregulation plan hatched under his republican predecessor , the governor has put the state deep into the power business .
mr. davis says that the authority is part of what he sees as a " hybrid " system where public power plays an important role augmenting private enterprise in the electricity business .
what does it mean for edison to take over the role [ of buying power ] if the state already has signed all these contracts ? " asks state sen. debra bowen , a democrat who heads the senate 's energy committee .
mr. davis has been deeply enmeshed in almost every aspect of the electricity mess this year , after having once been relatively aloof from the burgeoning crisis .
under the deregulation plan , the state 's investor - owned utilities sold off many of their power plants to other companies and repurchased that electricity through a state - sponsored auction .
consumer rates were frozen and customers were given the option to buy electricity from nonutility retail suppliers .
when mr. davis could n't get legislative permission to borrow money short - term for power purchases , he signed an executive order authorizing the state to borrow up to $ 5 billion from commercial lenders .
in another executive order , the governor suspended emission standards for power plants to let them run more hours during the peak - demand periods .
crisis of governance ' the electricity mess has produced " the most extraordinary crisis of governance we 've had in california in the postwar period , " says bruce cain , director of the institute of governmental studies at the university of california at berkeley .
under a law enacted in february , none of the tens of billions of dollars of state electricity purchases or related costs can be challenged as imprudent by the public utilities commission .
it scares the hell out of me , " says henry duque , a republican puc member appointed by former gov. pete wilson .
the governor 's press secretary , steve maviglio , says he does n't know whether they were asked about their holdings before being hired .
even so , mr. davis argues , state negotiators did well enough .
still , he and some other state leaders are urging the puc to revoke a fundamental tenet of deregulation : the right of consumers to shop around for low - cost electricity .
removing this option is essential to prevent a " jail break " of customers seeking prices lower than what the state must charge , says carl wood , one of mr. davis 's three democratic appointees to the five - member puc .
decisions are being made , with almost no public discussion , that foreclose other options , " says ms. bowen , the state senator , who is close enough to the governor that she played his therapist in the " sopranos " skit .
one voice ' the state 's enlarged role in the utility business was on display when negotiators convened recently at the federal energy regulatory commission in washington to discuss alleged supplier overcharges .
leonard pitts jr. the miami herald it 's my job to have something to say .

Re: Bullet Points on EPMI Intervention in Mirant proceeding against CAISO before FERC

intercompany charges are like any other intercompany item in my view , and should be agreed upfront by both the sender and receiver before someone automatically " charges " to someone else 's books .
if there is recourse ( i.e. , the ability to reject inappropriate charges or charges not agreed to ) , i see fewer potential problems .
the epsc charges are invariably incorrect , there is no recourse , and facilities does not act like a service provider .
if it is wrong you not only have to tell them it is wrong but have to tell them who it should have gone to - a real problem since it is debatable that you would know what they are responsible for knowing in order to charge costs out .
this is intended to allow networks to put these intercompany charges directly to your assets .

: fw : fuel management agreement gentlemen : i think this e - mail i received early saturday morning directly and succinctly answers the questions we posed to indian counsel .
there is no theory under indian law that enron could use , to make an enforceable claim against mseb in the context of the facts placed before us .
yes , our view is that enron has no enforceable claim against mseb on the basis of the facts placed before us and the provisions of the agreement .
enron 's right to the fixed fee from dpc under the agreement , is contingent upon dpc being paid the corresponding ppa fuel management fee by mseb .
as a result , enron has no claim against mseb for non - payment of the ppa fuel management fee to dpc and therefore has no claim against mseb under the agreement as there is no breach by mseb of its functions under the agreement .

california 's economy is soaring , the state 's tax coffers -- and davis ' own re - election treasury -- are bulging , voters are in a complacent mood , and there have been none of the devastating disasters that plagued the state during the early 1990s .
there is , however , a very dark cloud casting a shadow over davis ' governorship : the prospect of rolling blackouts as demand for electric power exceeds supply , accompanied by tremendous increases in californians ' power bills .
san diego utility customers were hit hard last summer as their local utility emerged from the mandatory rate freeze imposed by the state 's 1996 utility deregulation scheme .
they enacted legislation rolling back power bills temporarily , but leaving it unclear whether ratepayers , taxpayers , san diego gas and electric co. or power suppliers would eventually eat the wholesale costs that led to the spikes .
the two are still operating under the rate freeze , but have acquired at least $ 5 billion in unanticipated wholesale power costs that they want to pass on to their ratepayers .
california politicians have been demonizing the power suppliers , saying they took advantage of the deregulation program 's auction process to drive up costs far beyond reason .
davis ripped into the ferc response during a hearing earlier this month , accusing it of " gutting ( california 's ) ability to protect consumers " and proposing " new and completely untried market rules , making guinea pigs of california consumers in yet another reckless deregulation experiment . "
the utilities seem to be offering davis a deal : allow them to begin raising rates now to recover their " stranded costs " for wholesale power and they will avoid sticker - shock raises in 2002 .
the only certainty is that unless ferc reverses itself , davis will remain on the hook for whatever happens -- the sort of unpredictable situation that he hates to encounter .
any idea who to call about that one ?

the governor would like to solve this thing in one fell swoop , but if pg&e is sitting up there being obdurate , then this thing is severable , " davis political advisor garry south said in los angeles .
under the state 's limited deregulation plan , the companies were forced to buy wholesale power at market prices but were not allowed to pass along increased costs to customers .
davis had not decided whether he would join the talks directly , or leave that task to his aides , san francisco attorney michael kahn and former southern california edison executive michael peevey .
this month , dr. weintraub focuses on the argument that the treatment for the cause of the terrorist attacks lies in reducing poverty .
, number 22 the terrorist attack : treating the causes sidney weintraub
should the treatment deal with reversing the terrorists ' hatred for the united states , eliminating anti - jewish sentiment , correcting the lack of freedom in most middle - eastern countries , refighting the kosovo war and getting some americans killed , making too many or too few charges against foreign human rights violations , eliminating homosexuality and civil liberties in the united states ( as jerry falwell and pat robertson seem to believe ) , altering the capitalist system that prevails in the developed countries , changing the u.s. lifestyles that so infuriate muslim zealots , reducing poverty ?
i find it impossible that anyone can seriously believe that because there is much poverty in the middle east , terrorists who are not themselves poor concluded that the corrective was to attack the world trade center towers and the pentagon and kill thousands of innocent people .
i have not understood the motivations of the protesters who show up to disrupt meetings of international development and trade organizations because precisely these institutions have taken the lead to reduce poverty .
redistribution without growth merely rearranges the scenery , but does not get at the core of the problem .
poverty reduction , if all of these needs are met , must then be a conscious part of government programs , which is why bumper - sticker slogans like " reduce poverty " are fatuous .
yes , it does , but what is wrong with that ?
yet , the priorities of dictatorial leaders , whether religious or otherwise , are not economics - or reducing poverty - but a host of other issues , from religious fanaticism to political dominance to a hatred of neighbors .
is this situation mainly the fault of the united states ?
does the existence of israel impoverish its arab enemies ?

gray davis is relying on stringent conservation measures , increased electricity supply and quick legislative authority to proceed with a $ 12.5 billion revenue bond issue to head off blackouts this summer . ? ?
that 's because dwr cut long - term contracts covering a major part of the electricity needed during peak times , said ron nichols , senior managing director for navigant consulting inc. ? ?
much of that conservation , 2,484 megawatts , will come from three different conservation programs through the california independent system operator , keeper of the state 's power grid . ? ?
the rest of the cuts come from the sticker shock of higher consumer rates and by estimating how much less power californians are using this year compared to last year . ? ?
the public utilities commission ordered the utilities to pay those generators every other week starting april 1 , but the large debts have the generators fighting to stay open , said jan smutny - jones , executive director of the independent energy producers . ? ?
also monday , an assembly subcommittee unveiled four bills monday designed to increase supplies of natural gas , including streamlining approvals for gas storage and new pipelines . ? ?
meanwhile , the state remained free of power alerts tuesday morning as reserves stayed above 7 percent . ? ?
but davis said his advisors now are trying to sell the idea to a committee of pg&e creditors that hold a stake in the utility 's chapter 11 proceeding . ? ?
the creditors committee , representing the hundreds of companies owed money by pg&e , does not by itself hold the power to accept or reject the deal , which davis sees as a key to his plan to restructure the state 's crippled electricity system .
the advisors told the committee about the deal they struck with southern california edison to buy its share of the statewide transmission grid , and the similar deal that pg&e rejected . ? ?
the davis administration made public monday its most detailed breakdown yet on the costs it expects to incur purchasing electricity over the next years . ? ?
however , the extra information failed to satisfy republican lawmakers , who are holding up legislation needed to repay the state budget for the billions already spent on electricity . ? ?
several republicans took note of the date : it is the month of the 2002 gubernatorial election , when davis is expected to seek a second term . ? ?
davis administration officials defended the figures , saying that they were conservative . ? ?
a spokesman for davis said the republican - drafted legislation offers " a lot of things we do n't need , and fails to address the one thing we do need , " namely firm price controls on wholesale electricity sales . ? ?

california and the west ; the california energy crisis ; ; power marketer ordered by ferc to refund $ 8 million ; energy :
in the first action of its kind during the california energy crisis , federal regulators have ordered an out - of - state electricity marketer to refund $ 8 million in connection with allegations that plants were improperly shut down to hike power prices . ? ?
tulsa - based williams energy marketing & trading has agreed to pay the refund under an order issued monday by the federal energy regulatory commission . ? ?
while federal investigations of alleged overcharges by several firms are continuing , monday 's order marked the first time a major power merchant has been forced to pay back earnings since california forged into electricity deregulation in 1996 . ? ?
critics and the state 's independent grid operator have accused power sellers of unjustly ratcheting up electricity prices in part by taking plants offline . ? ?
williams markets power produced at california plants owned by aes corp. of arlington , va. ? ?
aes spokesman aaron thomas said the power plants in question were shut down because of mechanical problems .
he noted that his firm derived no profit from the replacement power sold by williams . ? ?
we literally get paid to convert williams ' gas into williams ' electricity , which they then sell into the marketplace , " thomas said .
we 're not paying any fines , and we did n't do anything wrong . " ? ?
as california 's electricity crisis exploded this year , so did lobbying by energy companies . ? ?
houston - based power producer reliant energy , for example , spent nearly $ 100,000 on lobbying firms through march 31 - -almost four times the $ 25,523 it spent during all of last year . ? ?
sempra energy , the parent firm of san diego gas & electric , spent $ 192,000 lobbying lawmakers in sacramento and regulators at the public utilities commission , roughly half of what it spent all of last year . ? ?
the utility also made campaign contributions to political parties and sacramento politicians , giving $ 250 to lt . gov. cruz bustamante , $ 750 each to assembly members keith richman ( r - northridge ) and george runner jr. ( r - lancaster ) and $ 1,000 to sen. kevin murray ( d - culver city ) , among others . ? ?

to celebrate , the provincial government ordered bc hydro to do something it had never done before .
bc hydro also guaranteed them no increases in electricity rates , which have not gone up for seven years . ? ?
when reminded that a march study by the california independent system operator , which runs that state 's power grid , accused bc hydro of market manipulation and profit gouging , mr. smith was less happy . ? ?
as paul pitzer , a columbia basin historian , has written , farmers here have always felt that " no price is too high to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill . " ? ?
on top of that , grant county 's public utility is paying many of the same farmers about $ 100 an acre not to farm their land . ? ?
still , the farmers , who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies that keep their irrigation system afloat , said they worried about the precedent they set when they traded water for cash . ? ?
several farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting the lifestyles of urban people , especially californians , who , those who were interviewed said , do not appreciate the food that the farmers put on their table . ? ?
we feel that americans are making decisions with their mouths full , " said tricia c. lubach , a marketing consultant whose husband is an irrigation farmer .
a couple of hundred miles northwest of george , in a penthouse conference room that overlooks vancouver harbor , mr. smith , the chairman of british columbia 's most profitable company , explained in mid - april what a pain it was selling electricity to californians . ? ?

power supplier to pay state byline :
an energy company accused of withholding power to drive up prices in california 's electricity market agreed to pay $ 8 million in a settlement approved monday by federal energy regulators . ? ?
the settlement is the first by a company accused of charging excessive electricity prices in the state . ? ?
the purchases were made in a 10-day period last april and
instead , the company was paid $ 750 a megawatt hour for electricity from other aes generating units during that period . ? ?
aes , which sells all power generated at its three plants in southern california to williams under a contract , did not share in the profits from the power sales . ? ?
officials at williams have repeatedly denied that the units were deliberately shut down .
as part of the settlement , the company did not admit wrongdoing . ? ?
federal officials had required williams and aes to justify more than $ 40 million charged to the iso .
in a separate matter , williams is one of several power providers accused by federal regulators of overcharging the iso $ 124 million for power in january and february .
the power providers are still disputing those charges . ? ?

knight ridder / tribune news service jose mercury news 1 , 2001 , tuesday section : state and regional news kr - acc - no : ?
for the first time in california 's current energy crisis , a power supplier accused of gouging the state 's wholesale electricity market has agreed to return a slice of its profits . ? ?
but williams admitted no wrongdoing and ferc specifically stated that it was not finding any violation of its rules .
the agreement was promptly criticized by state officials who contend that williams and other power suppliers have made billions in excess profits by selling in california 's troubled wholesale market . ? ?
an $ 8 million refund is nothing in the context of the excessive rates that these marketers , like williams , have been receiving , " charged carl wood , a member of the california public utilities commission . ? ?
the broader issue is like somebody walking out of a bank having robbed them of $ 1,000 and the cops stop them at the door and tell them : ' you 're going to have to hand back $ 10 , ' " wood complained .
california authorities had urged the federal commission to impose $ 33 million in penalties , or three times the $ 11 million in revenue that federal authorities initially estimated williams had made from the two plant shut - downs .
federal officials were n't available for comment monday and it was n't clear how the $ 8 million refund was determined . ? ?
she said the $ 8 million would simply be applied against the $ 252 million that williams is owed for other energy purchases by the iso and the state 's now - defunct power exchange . ? ?
in three other cases that do n't involve plant outages , ferc has ordered suppliers to justify their prices or refund up to $ 125 million in profits .
those cases are still pending . ? ?
in a separate proceeding , state authorities are urging ferc to reject williams ' application for permission to continue selling electricity in california at unregulated wholesale rates .
the episode occurred shortly before wholesale power prices began to skyrocket statewide last summer .
but because those units were n't subject to the same contract , a ferc statement said the iso was forced to pay williams a spot market price of nearly $ 750 per megawatt hour
an aes spokesman said his firm has no reason to manipulate plant outages because it has contracted to sell all of its power to williams at a pre - determined rate . ? ?
the energy woes of california and the nation can not be solved with price controls or conservation , but only by increasing the country 's supply of oil and natural gas and using more coal and nuclear power , vice president dick cheney said monday . ? ?
and the rest of america is starting to wonder when these rolling blackouts might roll over them , " cheney said in a toronto speech to the associated press . ? ?
without a clear , coherent energy strategy for the nation , all americans could one day go through what californians are experiencing now , or worse , " warned cheney who heads the administration 's high - level energy task force . ? ?
the aim here is efficiency , not austerity , " cheney said , rejecting the notion that americans should be told to " do more with less . " ? ?
conservation may be a sign of personal virtue , but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound , comprehensive energy policy , " he said . ? ?
earlier this month , davis approved an $ 850 million energy conservation plan that offers incentives to try to shave at least 2,000 megawatts a day off the state 's electricity usage . ? ?
davis on monday blasted bush and cheney for belittling conservation programs . ? ?
that is their bias , " davis said , referring to bush 's texas oil roots and cheney 's tenure as the head of
although federal regulators approved measures last week designed to rein in the cost of electricity in california , the plan fell far short of hard price caps . ? ?
cheney on monday restated the white house 's opposition to price caps , saying they were among a number of the " usual quick fixes " that have failed to solve the problem over the years . ? ?
the reality is that fossil fuels supply virtually a hundred percent of our transportation needs and an overwhelming share of our electricity requirements , " he said .
if we 're serious about environmental protection , then we must seriously question the wisdom of backing away from what is , as a matter of record , a safe , clean and very plentiful energy source . " ? ?
carl pope , executive director of the sierra club , said the white house is trying to convince people that their plan to ramp up energy production , even at the expense of environmental concerns , is the only way to solve the energy problems . ? ?
from the beginning , the administration has wanted to tell the american people that they did n't have any choice , that the only way they could transport themselves to work , heat their houses , toast their toast was to ruin the environment , " he said . ? ?
they 've been out pushing this agenda for a hundred days and the american people are rejecting it , " pope said . ? ?
she joined with more than 30 of her colleagues from california and washington to write to abraham monday and criticize the handling of the energy crisis . ? ?
federal energy regulators have proposed a surcharge on wholesale electricity sales in california to compensate generating companies , angering state officials who say the idea amounts to gouging consumers . ? ? ?
electric co. power companies accrued some $ 6 billion in unpaid bills from california 's struggling utilities in late 2000 and early this year , until the state stepped in to take over the purchasing of power . ? ? ?
dianne feinstein , d - calif . , who has been an outspoken critic of ferc 's policies in california , said the surcharge would " ensure that power generators get paid fully for their price gouging .
the dwr 's costs , in turn , are likely to be borne by california 's consumers and taxpayers . ? ? ?
if ( ferc 's ) concern is public policy and maintaining just and reasonable prices for consumers , i do n't quite understand why they would get into the middle of a legal wrangle about past bills ' getting paid , " said severin borenstein , director of the university of california energy institute in berkeley .
consumer advocates characterized the surcharge as a " gouging tax " that underscores the bush administration 's close ties to energy firms , many of which are based in president bush 's home state of texas . ? ? ?
this is evidence that ferc and the administration are more interested in protecting the energy industry than the consumers or taxpayers of california , " said doug heller , a consumer advocate with the los angeles - based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights .
it 's back - billing us to pay prices that were unjust and unreasonable per the ferc 's own analysis . " ? ? ?
ferc 's curt hebert , a mississippi republican whom president bush appointed chairman of the commission , was behind the surcharge proposal , which he told the wall street journal was a way " to stabilize the market .
the surcharge was proposed in ferc 's 39-page " mitigation " plan to alleviate wholesale electricity prices in california during power emergencies ; the plan was released last week .
ferc said it would accept public comment on the proposal for 30 days , after which it would decide whether to implement it . ? ? ?
i 'm not sure how federal regulators can pass a charge on wholesale costs which then ends up on consumers , without the state saying it 's ok .
the reference to " future unpaid bills " is puzzling since , with the state of california picking up the tab , electricity suppliers no longer are accumulating unpaid bills from the utilities . ? ? ?
the ferc proposal also implies that electricity generators have reduced production in california , an allegation the power companies themselves deny .
his methane project could save the university $ 15,000 annually in electricity costs while simultaneously reducing pollution and decreasing odors . ? ?
cows , in proportion to their weight , generate a lot of organic matter , " said williams , who grew up on a 480-acre farm that raised crops and livestock . ? ?
water and solid waste left over by the process are used for irrigation and fertilizer on cal poly crop lands , he added . ? ?
agricultural projects in tulare and kings counties have been rejected after neighbors lobbied against odors they anticipated from farms , he said . ? ?
and he has consulted with pig farmers in thailand and the philippines about methane power . ? ?
williams co. of tulsa , a major supplier of electricity to california , yesterday agreed to refund $ 8 million to the state to settle an investigation into alleged overcharging brought by the federal energy regulatory commission . ? ? ?
neither company admitted engaging in wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement , ferc said . ? ? ?
although ferc has directed more than a dozen california electricity suppliers to refund $ 124.5 million or justify their wholesale power bids to the state , the williams - aes case is
the only enforcement action ferc has brought so far involving california 's extraordinary wholesale power costs . ? ? ?
we are not paying a penny of this [ the ferc settlement ] , and i think that speaks volumes . " ? ? ?
california 's public utility commission had urged that companies face triple damages if found in violation of federal regulations , but ferc said the heavier sanctions were not warranted . ? ? ?
williams received a fee for this service and was also entitled to be reimbursed for plant operating costs at an hourly rate of about $ 63 per megawatt . ? ? ?
on different occasions in april and may , the state was notified that the plants were not in service and the state 's grid manager , the independent system operator , had to buy power from other aes units not covered by the supply contract .
the issue was whether the plants were legitimately out of service , the commission said . ? ? ?
an assembly electricity oversight committee releases report on its investigation of alleged natural gas price and supply manipulation . ? ?
- williams energy agrees to pay $ 8 million to settle charges by federal regulators that the company withheld power to drive up prices . ? ?
the bill moves to the senate . ? ?
but he asked her the same question , " do you notice anything different about me ? "
the young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied , " well its pretty hard to wear glasses with no f --- ing ears ! ! !
where did the energy crisis go ?
there is not and never was an energy " crisis .
one reason that supplies are ample is because natural gas inventories are now higher than usual .
these newspaper stories then go on to tell us that one of the main reasons for the drop in demand has been unseasonably cool weather .
the drop in electricity demand is actually something of a mystery .
unfortunately , most people missed the qualifications in the midst of the panic and braced themselves for a storm that was never sited in the first place .
when gasoline prices went up this spring , people bought less gasoline .
the moral of the story is that markets are n't " broke " when prices spike .
but no matter how unpleasant price spikes are in the short term , they 're absolutely necessary to remedy the underlying economic problems .
while it 's no surprise that liberals find such market success stories a constant revelation , the real surprise is that the ostensibly " hard - right " bush administration had such little faith in a free - market system it 's constantly praising .

b-10 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company sacramento -- facing criticism over possible conflicts of interest , davis administration officials on wednesday ordered consultants steering california through the energy crisis to sell off stock they own in power firms -- or lose their jobs .
a top legal aide to gov. gray davis said private consultants who were hanging on to power company stock had failed to uphold the state 's highest ethical standards .
for months , davis ' aides had not required the consultants to file financial disclosure forms to report their personal stock holdings .
barry goode , the governor 's legal affairs secretary , dispatched a letter early wednesday demanding that the consultants sell the stock by noon that day or face termination of their state contracts .
it is imperative that you give this instruction , immediately , to each of the consultants , " goode said in his letter to the state department of water resources , which has taken over from california 's beleaguered private utilities the job of buying power .

the letter seeks information about people with whom mr. cheney and other task force members met while developing the group 's policies , but not information about ' ' the deliberative process . ' '
but some democrats and other critics say energy industry executives and their lobbyists had too much influence over mr. cheney 's plan , while environmental and consumer groups were ignored or treated perfunctorily .
the idea that somehow only the energy industry has access just simply is n't true , ' '
the accounting office claims broad authority to examine government programs under the budget and accounting act of 1921 .
mr. cheney 's counsel , david s. addington , later questioned the appropriateness of the request and sent a letter challenging the accounting office 's legal authority .
it said the policy group was acting in a constitutional capacity as adviser to the president so it was not a government program subject to congressional oversight .

gorons truly believe that gore is a vietnam war hero , when in fact he was placed by family influence in a " cushy " correspondent 's job and the only action he saw was that of his brownie camera !
gorons actually believe that mr. gore is justified in illegally raising political funds from the office of the vp , simply because the vanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality .
gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums of political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows of poverty , since he again claimed ignorance .
gorons , incredibly , believe gore 's claim that he and tipper were the models for the book and movie , " love story " even though the book 's author , erich segal , says not .
gorons applaud mr. lieberman 's open rejection of president clinton 's immorality , but believe it was fine for mr. gore to remain silent on the subject , while simultaneously declaring mr. clinton " one of the greatest presidents of our history .
gorons hold the belief that gore is a compassionate man who will be the working man 's friend , in spite of the eviction notice he served to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down slum house that he was renting to them .

november 29 , 2000 -- some road to the presidency al gore is contesting the presidential election not from clawing ambition , his spinners tell us , but because he has divined that he really won .
the vice president in his monday speech to the nation repeated the professions of supermouthpiece david boies , for example , that there were 10,000 votes in miami - dade uncounted .
there were 175,000 such ballots across the state of florida , and 1.25 million across the nation .
the gore team currently argues that miami - dade is an undiscovered motherlode of gore votes because in the 135 of 614 precincts counted they produced a gore gain of 157 votes .
here they are literally arguing that poor judge burton and his colleagues did n't use sufficiently low dimple standards , what the lawsuit calls " incorrect legal standards , " to accept gore votes .
in seminole county , " independent " democrats have sued to kill absentee ballots certified for governor bush , who carried those votes by almost 2 to 1 .
we had a florida count nov. 7 , then a recount , and then we let al gore pick several famously democratic counties to hand - count ; we 've let various amounts of ambiguous chads be counted , let his party officials eyeball the ballots , often going his way by a 2 to 1 vote , let a gop counter in broward resign , extended the pre - established deadline and , let 's see , what else ?
this is not " counting every vote " ; it 's asking lawyers to overturn an election , not once but several times .
as to the democrats , a few have wavered publicly on joining the gore long march , but mostly the party is circling the two exhausted candidates , on the one hand standing behind mr. gore 's attempt to reverse the election , while simultaneously demanding to share power with the incoming bush administration .

copyright 2001 / the times mirror company government - owned utilities , including the los angeles department of water and power , were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels that helped ignite california 's exploding energy crisis during the summer and fall , according to public and confidential records .
no entity -- public or private -- earned as much in alleged excess profits as british columbia 's powerex , the state records show .
they had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in , " said sheffrin , who did not discuss any companies by name .
dwp general manager s. david freeman called the report 's findings " outrageous , " insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices .
it 's not as though we 're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down their throats .
yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in california 's deregulated market was the u.s. government 's bonneville power administration , a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal dams in the columbia - snake river basin .
bonneville was in the top five accused of taking excessive profits .
those rules -- and the bidding practices criticized by cal - iso -- so distorted the market that aquila power corp. of missouri , which tried to act responsibly , has bailed out .

former sec chairman arthur levitt , who left the agency in february , made financial fraud the agency 's chief enforcement priority during the last couple of years of his tenure .
last month , the sec filed fraud charges against arthur andersen , which agreed to pay $ 7 million to settle allegations it issued false audit reports about waste management inc. for five years .
the accounting crackdown comes amid intensifying scrutiny of wall street analysts ' power to influence stock prices .
accounting giant arthur andersen agreed to pay $ 7 million to settle charges it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management inc. in which the no . 1 u.s. trash - hauler overstated income by more than $ 1 billion , federal regulators said tuesday .
the fine was the largest - ever civil penalty against a big 5 accounting firm , said the securities and exchange commission in announcing the settlement against arthur andersen and four of its current or former partners .
arthur andersen , which did not admit or deny the sec charges , examined waste management 's books from 1992 through 1996 , and issued audit reports that falsely claimed that the statements had been prepared using generally accepted standards , the sec said .
arthur andersen and its partners failed to stand up to company management and thereby betrayed their ultimate allegiance to waste management 's shareholders and the investing public , " said richard walker , the sec 's top cop .

shippers condemn northwest 's must - flow ofos several northern nevada industrial gas users have accused northwest pipeline of violating its tariff by holding them hostage to the daily must - flow operational flow orders ( ofos ) that it has issued since early december in an effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system .
in a section 5 complaint filed friday , the industrial gas customers called on ferc to direct northwest to " cease and desist " the alleged violation of the tariff , which they claim is forcing them and other customers at the northern end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs of customers on the southern end of northwest 's system .
nevertheless , the pipeline 's daily must - flow ofos " have forced them into the volatile daily gas market to avoid extremely high non - compliance penalties , undermining their business decisions to rely on alternative fuels , " they told ferc [ rp01 - 189].
if one of the nevada industrial users , newmont mining corp. , had defied northwest 's order to flow 25 % of its contract demand , or 1,000/dth , on any december day , it would have been penalized $ 58,160 for that one day , they said .
if all of the nevada industrial customers had violated the pipeline 's order , the one - day penalty would have been $ 149,471 .
that 's because it requires one group of shippers , who see no additional benefits , to incur gas acquisition and transportation costs solely to subsidize service to another group of shippers , they argued .

F Y I -- News Articles re CFTC investigation of Avista Energy
avista corp. is also dealing with other legal problems that occurred during the tenure of avista chief executive officer tom matthews , who was replaced last month as ceo and resigned as chairman of the board friday .
pando is also one of the four avista energy traders who sued over their bonuses .
the cftc does not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation , " holden said .
the rumor is that someone leaked this trade in advance , " cutting into the potential profits of other traders , said the ex - trader , who asked not be named in this story .
he never worked in houston , where the trade was made , and has never traded futures contracts .
meanwhile , avista has settled three of the four energy traders ' lawsuits over their bonuses , said robert dunn , their spokane attorney .
in an interview last monday , former avista energy trader michael griswold said he made $ 25 million in profits for avista energy in 1998 before he left the company in the dispute over the bonuses .
hagens and berman represented washington , idaho and 11 other states as special attorneys general in the recent litigation against the tobacco industry spearheaded by washington attorney general christine gregoire .
it also won a settlement from junk bond financier michael milken on behalf of several washington state public employee pension funds .
investigators from the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) are checking into whether subsidiary avista energy illegally manipulated futures markets that in turn drove up the price of an electricity futures contract in 1998 .
it has the authority to bring civil charges into administrative or federal court , and also may refer alleged violations to the u.s. department of justice for criminal charges , according to attorney michael koblenz .
koblenz , a former cftc assistant director and regional counsel , is representing luis pando , a former avista energy senior analyst and trader , one of the four avista energy traders who sued the corporation for bonuses , and whose case is still pending .
avista corp. four former avista energy electricity traders sued the corporation , alleging that their managers reneged on profit bonuses in 1998 and 1999 .

but democratic controller points at governor carla marinucci , john wildermuth , chronicle political writers sunday , april 1 , 2001 , 2001
the politics of energy dominated the state democratic convention yesterday , as anxious delegates gave a lukewarm reception to embattled gov. gray davis , who clashed bitterly with party rival , controller kathleen connell .
speaking at the anaheim convention center , where dimmed lights were a constant reminder of yesterday 's stage 2 alert , davis blamed california 's energy woes on former gov. pete wilson , republican lawmakers and the federal energy regulatory commission , which , he charged , has failed to regulate greedy energy firms selling power at " out of control prices .
he insisted that he was not sure rate increases were necessary , refusing to say whether he would support huge hikes backed by the public utilities commission last week .
these republicans -- who were so enamored with deregulation just five years ago -- have become even more enamored with criticizing me as i try to clean up their mess , " the governor said to tepid applause from the 1,900 delegates .
this deregulation disaster was authored by a republican legislator , passed by a republican assembly , signed into law by a republican governor and implemented with undue haste by a republican puc .
but the governor 's republican - bashing was overshadowed politically by an attack by state controller connell , a candidate for los angeles mayor -- who rejected what she called davis ' " finger - pointing " and assailed his handling of the crisis .
there will be no excuses for democrats in this state , because we dominate state government , " connell said in a convention speech in which she also outlined proposals to require " power hogs , " such as malls , to install their own microgenerators .
this is why kathleen connell does n't have a friend in all los angeles , " he said .
it 's all air , " he said of her talk .
not only hot air but a foul wind .
unlike many democrats at the convention , festooned with " wilson did it " signs , she rejected as " irrelevant " the suggestion by davis that republicans were to blame for california 's energy woes .
but , she said , davis is a tough and smart politician , and " people are still going to be forgiving if ( the governor ) does something to attack the problem .
other democrats blame gop other democratic party leaders were also quick to defend davis and to blame republicans .
however , the plaintiffs are insisting that natwest , several of whose entities are corporations , provide two signatures instead of only one .

k.j. jennings , 36 , a walnut creek electrician , said he is crossing his fingers that his electricity bill will come down , now that wholesale prices are dropping .

the state stepped in in january when the utilities were unable to pay their bills and power generators threatened to stop selling them electricity .
this month , the price of one therm of gas was 48 cents , down dramatically from january , when it cost $ 1.42 , but still higher than january 2000 , when the rate was 31 cents per therm , according to homrig .
in warmer months , when furnaces get turned off , gas usage is usually less than half that in the winter , said homrig , and prices drop as a result .

in wake of ferc calif pwr order dow jones energy service , 11/03/00 ferc leaves calif pwr consumer relief in lap of congress dow jones energy service , 11/03/00 state utilities left with burden of reclaiming costs from crisis energy :
the california power exchange , the marketplace where the state 's three investor- owned utilities must buy electricity , is on the brink of losing its monopoly following this summer 's power - price surge .
the federal energy regulatory commission this week proposed eliminating a state rule that pg&e corp. , edison international and sempra energy purchase almost all their power through the exchange , which cost california consumers more than $ 100 million to create .
though intended to serve only california , the exchange now handles one - fourth of the power delivered in the western systems coordinating council , whose members supply 14 western states , two canadian provinces and parts of mexico .
even if pg&e , edison and sempra are allowed to obtain supplies through alternative means , the exchange is n't likely to go away , said jan smutny - jones , executive director of sacramento-
jones)- state regulators and legislators should re - regulate deregulated power markets after federal regulators left california consumers in the lurch , public citizen said friday .
the ralph nader - founded activist group decried an order by the u.s. federal energy regulatory commission wednesday , which found electricity rates in california were unjust and unreasonable , but failed to find legal reason to refund money to consumers .
ferc 's inability to protect consumers from unlawful price gouging reveals that state electricity deregulation has created unregulated monopolies and cartels that are free to fleece consumers for billions without fear of retribution , " higley said .
public citizen also called for the u.s. justice department to launch an investigation " to determine who is responsible for the unlawful abuse of california ratepayers by greedy power suppliers .
the u.s. federal energy regulatory commission wednesday issued an order in response to chronic power - supply problems in california that have sent wholesale power prices soaring .
while the order called for a sweeping restructuring of the market to lessen wholesale power price volatility , the commission found it lacked authority to refund money to consumers .
clearly federal legislative action is necessary because ferc did n't take the authority i think it has , " said rep. bob filner , r - calif .
rep. brian bilbray , r - calif . , who has made the power price shock an issue in his re - election campaign , criticized the commission for blaming the market structure dictated by state legislators , rather than power providers , for the soaring costs .
i 've never known a federal agency to override a state legislature like that , " bilbray said , accusing ferc of shrugging its shoulders by recognizing that market abuses occurred , but blaming the state lawmakers for it .
ferc 's pointing the fingers at the state and not the power companies , " he said .
filner said he is drafting legislation based on ferc 's conclusions to give ferc the authority to refund consumers the windfall profits of the state 's deregulated power producers .
the $ 6-billion wrecking ball that is waiting to slam either california consumers or the utility industry is back in the control of state officials after a federal commission this week failed to even address the problem .
despite repeated puc declarations that sce and pg&e can not raise rates under the current deregulation law , the utilities were encouraged when puc president loretta lynch said on oct. 17 that " the basic assumptions underlying ab 1890 are ripe for reconsideration .
but ferc said it found no evidence of specific market abuses and that it lacked the legal authority to order refunds of federallysanctioned wholesale rates in the absence of market - power evidence .
what ferc effectively did was say to california : you guys have to choose between utilities and consumers , " said douglas heller , consumer advocate at the santa monica - based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights .
ferc 's proposed order " really passed the buck " and left the puc with clear jurisdiction over the utilities ' transition costs , said bob finkelstein , a lawyer with the utility reform network .
although wholesale electricity rates have risen dramatically , sce and pg&e customers are still protected by a rate freeze until utilities pay off costs related to " stranded assets " such as nuclear , wind and other noneconomic assets , or until march 2002 .
they say they have no basis for refunds but that door is not slammed shut .
but the regulators , though declaring power prices charged this summer were not " just and reasonable , " as required by law , said they did not have the legal authority to demand refunds from generators , some of whom have made huge profits selling power in the california market .
jones)- seven federal legislators from california are urging the federal energy regulatory commission to hold its scheduled nov. 9 public hearing on california 's electricity problems in san diego , not washington .
san diego residents were the first in the nation to be charged deregulated rates , and many saw their bills double and triple this summer due to a spike in wholesale power prices .
ferc held hearings in san diego in august to determine why those prices were so high .
- california sen. barbara boxer on thursday said she was " distressed " that u.s. regulators did not provide immediate relief for her state 's power consumers when they backed draft measures on wednesday for fixing the troubled electricity system there .
democrat boxer , in a letter to u.s. federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) chairman james hoecker , urged the commission to take stronger actions before their draft order becomes final next month to aid consumers .
it is imperative that ferc act promptly to address california 's energy crisis , " boxer wrote to hoecker .
san diego consumers were most impacted by a sharp price rise in california 's wholesale power markets this summer , since under the state 's deregulation plan they were forced to pay market rates without a safety net .
ferc did not order refunds as part of its draft remedies announced on wednesday , saying they legally did not have the power to do so .

diesel power draws environmental criticism , los angeles may 23 , 2001 , 6:18pm stand up , texas , against california 's bullying by jonathan wilcox ladies and gentlemen :
the governor and his appointees at the state air resources board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries , utilities and the operator of the state 's electricity grid , arguing that routine use of the backup diesels would endanger public health .
environmentalists who have been catching word of the davis plan this week argue that it would shatter the governor 's repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards during the energy crisis .
given your awareness of the public health threats of diesel emissions , please stop and have these proposals considered in a more thoughtful and public manner , " the letter states .
freeman argued , however , that the additional health threat from non - emergency use of diesel generators is " marginal " compared with the health and safety problems triggered by power outages .
but sandra spelliscy , attorney for the environmentalist planning and conservation league , countered , " if the health impacts are so marginal , why has the governor 's own air quality enforcement agency opposed this ?
unlike diesel - powered trucks and buses , most diesel standby generators run with little or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergencies .

cc - electricity length : 874 words headline : california official cites evidence of electricity price manipulation
an investigation into electricity prices has turned up evidence that generators are throttling their power plants up and down to drive up prices , according to california 's top utility regulator . ? ?
loretta lynch , president of the state public utilities commission , said wednesday that an investigation started last year to examine electricity prices , and which later turned to examine unprecedented numbers of power plant outages , has found instances where generating units were backed down until electricity emergencies were declared and then brought back up in such a way as to maximize profits . ? ?
what we saw was a pattern of individual behavior , " lynch said . ? ?
included among those reasons is a little - known tactic to insure themselves against breakdowns that would be limited under a federal order that is to take effect next week . ? ?
although lynch would not reveal more specifics , her comments , which echoed revelations she made before a state senate committee last week in southern california , come as accusations , legal threats and rhetoric are all swirling to a boil . ? ?
earlier this week , attorney general bill lockyer , whose office is working with the puc in one of several ongoing electricity market investigations , reportedly said that he wanted to escort enron corp. chairman kenneth lay to a prison cell " that he could share with a tattooed dude who says , ' hi , my name is spike , honey . " ' ? ?
the heated rhetoric and continuing legal threats have infuriated generators , who continue to trot out figures showing that they are running power plants harder than ever . ? ?
there 's nothing that gets under our skins more than somebody -- some government official -- who is ill - informed making those judgments , " said tom williams , a spokesman for duke energy , a north carolina - based company that owns three major power plants in california and is building a fourth . ? ?
but lynch and other state leaders are becoming increasingly hostile in their remarks about the half- dozen out - of - state power companies that bought utility - owned power plants in 1998 and 1999 as the state moved to restructure the electricity industry . ? ?
that is a rationale they are using , " said puc energy division director paul clanon . ? ?
duke , mirant corp. and pacific gas & electric were among the companies who objected to a draft order from federal regulators that would put an end to the practice of withholding power from the spot- market to cover the possibility of a breakdown . ? ?
but ferc shot that argument down , saying that although it is reasonable for a company to not sell all of its electricity ahead of time , there is no reason to hold back power from the hour - to - hour spot market , as mirant wanted to do . ? ?
the federal commission said that , contrary to mirant 's claims , " the generator faces no financial risk " if it is forced to sell all its available power on the spot market . ? ?
the vermont senator 's widely anticipated decision to abandon his fellow republicans and put democrats in control of the senate could have big implications for california , particularly on energy and environmental policy , lawmakers and lobbyists said wednesday . ? ?
in fact , the administration 's proposed budget cuts for programs to promote renewable energy were said to be a factor in jeffords ' decision . ? ?
even if the senate approves electricity price caps , for example , the measure would face stiff opposition in the gop - dominated house -- and a likely veto if it made it to the president 's desk . ? ?
still , a democratic majority in the senate would give feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up the political heat on the administration and congressional republicans on energy policy . ? ?
it kicks up the dust , " groaned one energy industry lobbyist who requested anonymity . ? ?
" if president bush 's hard - edged conservative approach has in fact caused the balance to shift towards democrats in the senate , it will have profound implications not just for california , but for the environment and our nation 's energy policy . " ? ?
environmentalists seemed almost giddy as they contemplated the possible impact of jeffords ' decision on the policies they care about . ? ?
all of a sudden , they said , it seems less likely that oil exploration will take place in the arctic national wildlife refuge , that recreational snowmobiles will have free access to yellowstone national park , or that the administration 's desire to promote nuclear power will be embraced by congress . ? ?
another issue under his purview would be the two - decade dispute over a proposed repository for the nation 's spent nuclear fuel at yucca mountain in nevada . ? ?
yucca mountain is a dead turkey , " declared michael francis of the wilderness society . ? ?
but with democratic senators in charge , that would become less of a threat , they said . ? ?
every wacko idea republicans have will get a higher level of scrutiny , " francis said . ? ?
they 've got people who know all the answers and do n't want to listen .
under a democratic majority , feinstein would be in line to chair two subcommittees : the military construction panel of the senate appropriations committee , and the technology , terrorism and government information subcommittee of the senate judiciary committee . ? ?

the head of a houston energy company denied driving california natural gas prices to unprecedented levels and testified wednesday that his firm actually passed up an opportunity to make nearly $ 700 million in additional profits . ? ?
the california public utilities commission and southern california edison have charged that el paso merchant , which sells natural gas , withheld space on a pipeline owned by an affiliated company last year to create an artificial shortage that sent prices zooming . ? ?
edison 's experts estimate that the alleged scheme has added $ 3.7 billion to california 's total energy costs , since most of the state 's power plants are fueled by natural gas . ? ?
but eads , under oath , denied that merchant was after predatory profits . ? ?
when california prices spiked last november , eads said merchant was locked into its hedge contracts and was unable to reap the full potential profit . ? ?
eads testified that merchant has made a profit of 76 cents per million british thermal units on gas shipped to california . ? ?
administrative law judge curtis l. wagner jr. listened intently to the testimony , at times questioning eads himself . ? ?
the hearing -- originally scheduled to last for five days -- entered its eighth day wednesday . ? ?
such a role would have violated commission rules . ? ?
merchant 's attorneys , while opposing public release of the feb. 14 presentation , say it has been taken out of context . ? ?
senate panel approves 2 board nominations ? ?
the nominations now go to the full senate for consideration . ? ?
even on the extremely fast track paved by term limits , antonio villaraigosa 's race to power in sacramento was lightning quick . ? ?
in the back - slapping , favor - trading environment of the capitol , he turned his considerable skills as a bipartisan schmoozer into a record of constructive compromise -- including marshaling a massive , $ 9.2-billion school bond issue in 1998 and a $ 2.1-billion parks bond issue in 1999 . ? ?
yet villaraigosa 's inexperience also showed : a lackluster detail man by his own admission , he was forced by his weaknesses in the mechanics of policy to lean heavily on a strong staff as well as on intellectually gifted colleagues who did n't always agree with him . ? ?
some fellow democrats accuse him of padding his resume by claiming credit for bills on which others had done most of the hard work .
hertzberg is conspicuously absent from villaraigosa 's list of endorsers . ? ?
there were none of the fiscal or natural disasters that circumscribed the actions of past state figures .
the liberal who arrived here in 1994 after being elected from los angeles ' ethnically mixed 45th assembly district -- fresh from tenures as a teachers union leader and president of the local aclu chapter -- emerged six years later with bouquets from conservative republicans . ? ?
in a tribute given as term limits forced villaraigosa from the assembly last year , conservative republican roy ashburn of bakersfield talked about defending him at rotary and kiwanis club meetings . ? ?
so did a bill to commute prison sentences for terminally ill prisoners . ? ?
his most notable success , achieved on a second attempt with the support of orange county republican leader scott baugh , was a bill permitting women to breast - feed their children in public . ? ?
( the los angeles department of water and power was not required to deregulate . ) ? ?
i had some concerns about the bill , but i knew that los angeles was protected because of its municipal utility , and that was a big factor in my mind . ' ? ?
instead , he says , reporters focused on the loss of a " safe " democratic seat in oakland to green party candidate audie bock in a 1999 special election . ? ?
even though villaraigosa initially supported millionaire al checchi over gray davis in the 1998 governor 's race , he quickly forged a strong bond with davis during the campaign . ? ?
davis has endorsed villaraigosa for mayor . ? ?
the bottom line was that he was really good at getting votes , " kurakawa recalled . ? ?
brown , an early endorser of villaraigosa for mayor , said : ? ?
in the time period antonio ran the place as speaker , the budget process moved smoothly , the membership responded appropriately and the output was what it was supposed to be .
but if villaraigosa approached brown 's hold on the membership , he lacked the former speaker 's sense of detail and instant grasp of policy .
brown 's three decades in the assembly to villaraigosa 's six years . ? ?
at the table were gov. pete wilson ( 32 years in elected office ) , senate president john burton ( 28 years ) and minority leaders ross johnson and bill leonard ( 20 years each)--a century 's experience in sacramento , washington and local office . ? ?
but wilson and the other republicans eventually warmed to him . ? ?
burton and wilson were from the same generation and were singing old television commercials -- a trivia kind of thing .
still , some members contend that the inexperience exacted a price . ? ?
but the senate and the governor mostly set the agenda on the budget while antonio was there . " ? ?
villaraigosa always on the move ? ?
another said she learned to keep contact with the speaker by holding onto his sleeve . ? ?
he cites as an example his " top accomplishment " as speaker -- the 1998 school bond issue .
he gives much of the credit to then - deputies hertzberg and tom torlakson , a former antioch schoolteacher . ? ?
when it came time to negotiate with republicans , leonard recalled , villaraigosa was there to close the deal . ? ?
assemblyman keeley , who fiercely opposed the pg&e effort , had sponsored an alternative bill calling for public ownership of the hydroelectric facilities . ? ?
his key committee appointments included hertzberg , in rules , and carole migden of san francisco in appropriations . ? ?
he had the confidence to surround himself with smart people who were not going to shy away from a fight .
none of these people were sycophants , " recalled former assemblyman richard katz ( d - sylmar ) , who was majority leader when villaraigosa served as whip . ? ?
villaraigosa defeated polanco 's candidate to reach the assembly . ? ?
polanco ally martha escutia , now a state senator from whittier , accuses villaraigosa of hijacking her 1997 bill to create the healthy families program , which provides medical coverage for children in low - income households . ? ?
villaraigosa lists the healthy families legislation as one of his four key accomplishments in sacramento , along with the school and parks bond measures and his participation in a 1999 assault weapons ban . ? ?
moreover , the final bill that emerged , with villaraigosa listed as a principal author , contained much of the same language as the escutia bill but does not carry her name . ? ?
villaraigosa dismissed those claims , saying he had introduced similar " universal coverage for children " bills in previous sessions .
one such bill in 1996 never made it out of the health committee but did have a line stating that all children under 18 " should be entitled to child health care . " ? ?
now , an oakland - based children 's advocacy group that was a principal sponsor of the bill that finally passed , said villaraigosa legitimately deserves most of the credit . ? ?
villaraigosa " jockeyed the bill in the assembly , but jockeying should not be confused with passing it or writing it , " he said . ? ?
hertzberg , a hyperkinetic former bond attorney , replaced villaraigosa as speaker in april 2000 . ? ?
but by the spring of 1999 , hertzberg was already gathering signatures and making his own move against villaraigosa . ? ?
but villaraigosa also kept $ 1.3 million for his own campaign chest , putting it in an account to run for state senate in 2002 should his mayoral campaign fail . ? ?
bustamante had done the same thing , taking more than $ 1 million he had raised as speaker to finance his successful 1998 campaign for lieutenant governor .
villaraigosa had loudly criticized the bustamante move , so most of his colleagues in the democratic caucus expected him to leave the money behind .
villaraigosa defends the money transfer by saying , accurately , that he had already given more money back to democrats than any previous speaker . ? ?
this personal fallout aside , villaraigosa 's legacy as speaker remains his ability to get along with most of sacramento 's influential figures , building political bridges as he went . ? ?
in each case , however , democratic colleagues contend that at least some of the the heavy lifting was done by other lawmakers . ? ?
but whittier state sen. martha escutia contends that villaraigosa took her bill , filed earlier , and morphed it into his own . ? ?
villaraigosa calls this 1998 senate bill the " crown jewel " of his term as speaker .
this landmark 1999 legislation banning the manufacture , import and sale of assault weapons tops villaraigosa 's list in the crime and public safety category .
antonio villaraigosa admits he 's not a detail person , but says he hires aides who are .
the agreement to meet came after a weekend during which vice president dick cheney called one of the democratic governor 's ideas " goofy " and labeled as a " harebrained scheme " davis ' decision to buy electricity , and davis blasted the bush - cheney energy plan for failing to address california 's needs . ? ?
white house press secretary ari fleischer said bush will meet with davis next week , probably tuesday . ? ?
he followed up with a letter dated wednesday in which he requested a meeting " to discuss the most difficult issue facing the consumers and businesses of california : energy . " ? ?
in his letter , davis warned that california 's energy crisis " is a national economic issue . " ? ?
davis has been demanding that the bush administration cap wholesale electricity prices charged by independent energy companies , something the president opposes . ? ?
the state ; the energy crisis ; reliant offers to slash prices if rules waived ; pollution :
a houston - based energy wholesaler singled out by gov. gray davis for charging sky - high amounts offered on wednesday to slash prices 80 % if air pollution regulators waive certain rules . ? ?
three of the company 's power plants can run only a limited number of hours each year under air pollution rules designed to reduce smog . ? ?
in a letter to davis ' energy advisors , company vice president john stout proposed that the state not subtract from reliant 's allotted hours whenever its plants are ordered to run by state grid operators , who buy power on an emergency basis to prevent uncontrolled blackouts . ? ?
earlier this month , the state power buyers paid reliant $ 1,900 per megawatt - hour , several times recent market prices , to avoid blackouts on a hot afternoon .
davis complained publicly , naming the price and the seller -- information that grid operators are supposed to keep confidential under federal rules . ? ?
we 're not sure of the logic behind reliant 's proposal , " said doug allard , top regulator at the santa barbara county air pollution control district .
that is possible , allard said , because a 1991 test of the plant 's pollution concluded that it released only one - third as much nitrogen oxide -- a precursor to smog -- as regulators believed when they wrote the permit years ago . ? ?
the proposal , part of an emerging strategy to avert blackouts this summer , is one of several options being advanced by richard sklar , whom gov. davis appointed last month to bring more electricity online with less red tape . ? ?
but environmentalists and air quality officials are outraged , calling the plan a recipe for unhealthy air during the smoggiest months in the nation 's most polluted state .
the legions of small backup generators typically burn diesel fuel and have no pollution controls . ? ?
california has about 17,200 backup generators , most in hospitals , office buildings , sewage treatment plants and university labs , although some are portable rentals . ? ?
each generator spews 500 times more nitrogen dioxide for each megawatt of electricity than a natural - gas fired power plant , according to the state air resources board .
nitrogen dioxide contributes to ozone and microscopic airborne particles , two abundant air pollutants . ? ?
only about 550 megawatts could be generated each day , officials say , in a state that requires nearly 100 times as much to function . ? ?
gov. gray davis will issue an executive order today requiring that californians be given at least one hour 's notice before blackouts hit , according to a top administration official . ? ? ?
the iso board is scheduled to discuss its plan at a meeting today . ? ? ?
administration officials said the two - day notice would go to law enforcement , while everyone would get a 24-hour warning . ? ? ?
but one consumer group said davis should be doing more to stop the blackouts from happening in the first place . ? ? ?
the public safety aspect must be taken into account , said one consumer group . ? ? ?
? -- when the power returns , turn one appliance on at a time to prevent power surges . ? ? ?
-- tell children who are home alone to remain calm , turn off the tv and computers and not to use candles .
the state 's power companies , out - of - state energy providers , president bush and the legislature all come out worse than davis in the survey . ? ? ?
davis ' ratings have gone down , but a lot of others are given lower ratings " when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are handling the state 's energy situation , said mark dicamillo , director of the field poll . ? ? ?
growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent ratings skidding for anyone connected with the energy business . ? ? ?
but 54 percent also put bush 's efforts in the poor / very poor category , and 52 percent consigned the federal energy regulatory commission to the same level . ? ? ?
to the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue , " he said , " i suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather dismal . " ? ? ?
the percentage of residents giving him poor or very poor marks jumped to 38 percent , up from 22 percent in january . ? ? ?
in the public 's eye , it 's everyone else that is not doing what they should be doing . " ? ? ?
the field poll chronicle graphic ? ?
the proposal , one of several options the governor is considering , would pay for diesel power - which at its dirtiest is 500 times more polluting than the cleanest natural gas power plants - when electricity supplies are stretched . ? ?
california 's persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year , with more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air conditioning . ? ?
that 's more than nine times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in 1999 , according to state air resources board data . ? ?
but since the state 's power crunch began , regional air - quality regulators have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently . ? ?
re : question i was running down a hill during my hanggliding class , lost my balance , stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle .
the chairman of the energy and commerce committee of the united states house of representatives , w.j. " billy " tauzin , and the chairman of the subcommittee on energy and air quality , joe barton , have requested that the commission examine various state retail competition programs and describe those features that appear to have resulted in consumer benefits and those that have not yielded consumer benefits .
it is not necessary to respond to each question for every state .
although lazaro has n't called me back yet about his review of the court 's file , which he told me last week he would do , the attorneys on the conference call reportedly represented all the named defendants , and no one had an earlier answer date .
this would obviously be a home run in this case ; also , it would prevent grynberg from getting his hands on documents that he would then pretend to have known about all along in his qui tam action , bolstering his original source argument .
there is a fundamental ambiguity in the pleadings , which is that the suit purports to be both one for the collection of delinquent ad valorem taxes , and one for damages based on fraud , etc .
why the petition mentions " other counties " .
others agreed about the poor draftsmanship , but the concensus is that the state of texas ( which apparently can not collect ad valorem taxes anyway ) is not a party or being represented as such by rsm .

california gets cold shoulder in capital bush hit list ?
cheney did n't personally tell me that , but his staff did , " inslee said later .
in february , when the white house released a broad blueprint of its 2002 budget , california lawmakers were stunned to see that it included $ 83 million in savings at the federal emergency management agency resulting from a requirement that public buildings be privately insured .
but after dozens of insurance carriers declared bankruptcy under the weight of claims from the 1989 loma prieta earthquake in northern california , no one knows whether it 's even possible for cities such as los angeles and san francisco to buy coverage .
all 52 members , from the most conservative republican to the most liberal democrat , signed onto a letter saying that that at the very least the government ought to study the wisdom of shifting public money from improving the earthquake integrity of buildings to buying insurance .
the republicans balked at attacking the idea in a joint letter with democratic lawmakers , and instead launched a campaign to educate the white house on why a bad idea under the clinton administration remained a bad idea now .
on another budget issue , the white house slashed by $ 135 million federal support that states receive for incarcerating undocumented criminals .
the common explanation on why california is getting such lousy treatment is its politics .
all but one of its constitutional offices are occupied by elected democrats .
i think by this time in the clinton - gore administration , they had been here four or five times , " said bruce cain , director of the institute for governmental studies at the university of california - berkeley .

one after another , disclosures spilled out of his company over the last month : the partnerships had hidden billions in debt ; years of enron 's reported profits had been exaggerated ; the government was investigating .
and sure enough , the stock price tumbled day after day , and credit agencies lowered enron 's ratings once and then yesterday again , turning the company 's debt to junk and its shares into a penny stock .
deprived of enough information , and then repelled by what they learned , the free markets in which mr. lay had put so much faith all but destroyed , in a matter of weeks , everything he had built .
he engineered its merger with internorth , an omaha pipeline company , and then became chief executive of the combined company and changed its name to enron .
as the company grew , he had become increasingly involved in public affairs , serving as host when a global economic conference was held in houston in 1990 and when the republican national convention came to the city in 1992 .
when mr. bush lost his 1992 campaign for re- election as president , mr. lay brought a number of senior bush aides to enron as directors or consultants , including james a. baker iii , the former secretary of state , and robert a. mosbacher , the former secretary of commerce .
mr. lay also cultivated mr. bush 's son george w. long before he was considered a serious national candidate .
but mr. lay was not some stylish dot - com brat ; by all accounts , he is an immensely likable product of middle america .

can cms 's prior course of dealing be used to support mplp 's contractual interpretation , or is there otherwise an equitable argument that cms should not be able to recover prior " overpayments " ( as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity payments ) ?
--the cover letter from cms suggests that the alleged payment error resulted in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the puc .
the counter - argument , however , is that the foregoing language only pertains to the computation of a percentage " haircut " or adjustment that is applied to the stated capacity charges on exhibit d , whatever those may be , rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective .

the question is , is it the same power ?
among them is jan smutny - jones , executive director of the independent energy producers association , a power - firm trade group , and chairman of the independent system operator , which oversees most of california 's power grid .
while acknowledging that such laundering is possible , smutny - jones said there is no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespread .
the thing that makes all these problems go is the fact that the iso has said , ` we 'll pay whatever it takes to keep the lights on , ' and that 's screwing consumers big time .
one california investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt laundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of power was being sold to another state and then sold back into california minutes later .
while hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any given day , they said , the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the same power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculation .
that 's one of the things that 's being examined " by the various federal and state agencies investigating this summer 's extraordinary rise in california power prices .

curt hebert jr. , a fellow republican who is the federal commission 's chairman , has consistently opposed price caps .
mr. hebert has contended that high prices in california reflect supply and demand , not price gouging by power companies , though he has recently supported his agency 's policy to curtail the highest prices charged during hours of the most acute electricity shortages .
but his administration took no action on that front today . ' ' at this time , the makeup and leadership of the commission will stay as it is , ' ' said anne womack , a white house spokeswoman .

enron 's ability to transact in its core markets - north american wholesale gas and power - is essential if the company is to emerge from its current credit crisis , wall street analysts have said .
so far , that 's not enough to get companies to stop doing business with the houston - based giant .
aep is one of the most active traders of wholesale power in the u.s.
the web - based energy and metals marketplace , tallied 190 million megawatt hours of power trades in october , compared with 209 million mwhs in september , down 9 % .
enron 's stock price has plunged more than 50 % in the last two weeks , and its credit ratings have been downgraded by moody 's investors service , amid reports of losses related to partnerships once headed by the company 's former chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
eol averaged 5,700 daily trades , worth an estimated $ 2.5 billion , during the 30-day period ended friday .
almost daily revelations have rocked enron in the past two weeks and sent its stock price plummeting more than 60 percent .
enron is one of largest traders of wholesale natural gas and electricity in the united states .
late wednesday , the nation 's largest natural gas and power trader said it retained william mclucas , a partner in the washington , d.c.-based firm of wilmer , cutler & pickering and a former sec enforcement chief , as its counsel .
applicable government - wide ethics rules required that mr. cutler recuse himself from all matters involving wilmer , cutler for one year following his departure from the firm , and he did so .
john gavin , president of plymouth , minn.-based sec insight , said that despite public assurances to the contrary , enron 's announcements wednesday make it apparent that the company has " decided it is no longer in its interest to cooperate with the sec .
attached for your review is the draft of enron 's response to the complaint of the national association of gas consumers against " all sellers of natural gas in the united states of america in interstate commerce " .

bustamante and matthews have filed a class action suit against out of state energy companies . ?
among their claims were that the plant did not run at its potential capacity during periods of rolling blackouts , that part supplies were reduced or removed to slow maintenance , and even that the emphasis on safety was reduced . ? ?
a duke spokesman said after the press conference that they do shut down some of the units on weekends because the state does n't need the power and the cost of production is higher than the market price . ?
the employees also claimed that one turbine which uses liquid fuel was used more than they ever remember in place of steam turbines . ?
bustamante dismissed the iso 's confirmation that it had ordered the plant to?ramp?up and down during jan. 16 - 18 , the period discussed by the three previous whistleblowers . ?
bustamante made two incorrect statements during the press conference . ?
( connors said he was offered employment by duke but turned them down ; edwards indicated he took an enhanced severance package . ) ?
the second was in regard to a claim by one of the former employees that he had been told that the spare parts supply had been reduced in order to lower " inventory taxes . " ?
most of the press conference such as " that 's so wrong . " ?
following the press conference , he held an availability in the hallway . ?
the south bay plant now serves the iso market , while it used to serve a targeted southern california market under sdg&e. ?
he did not think the tone of the news release would be that the government of alberta needs to put a stop to the energy price gouging of consumers in alberta .
i have heard nothing from industry players so far about the dj story except the chairman of the independent power producers society of alberta circulated the dj story by email to the members of the ippsa board today with the following comment :

gov. gray davis said the state 's two largest utilities are partly to blame for this week 's widespread blackouts because they failed to pay millions of dollars owed to environmentally friendly power generators .
it 's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not pay the generators , " the governor said at a capitol news conference tuesday .
the state lost about 3,100 megawatts , or enough electricity to power 3.1 million homes , on tuesday from alternative energy plants that say they ca n't afford to keep operating because the utilities have n't paid their bills in weeks .
edison and pg&e say they have lost more than $ 13 billion since last june to climbing wholesale electricity prices , which the state 's 1996 deregulation law prevents them from passing on to ratepayers .
on tuesday , assembly republican leader bill campbell called on puc president loretty lunch to resign .
the blackouts were caused by a combination of problems , including unseasonably warm weather , reduced electricity imports from the pacific northwest , numerous power plants being shut down for repairs and the loss of power from alternative generators .
this comes amid the trend of declining government debt issuance and debt buybacks while financing grows among parastatal and private sector financing .
lenders and their supervisors should be mindful that in their zeal to make up for past excesses they do not overcompensate and inhibit or cut off the flow of credit to borrowers with credible prospects , ' ' greenspan told a convention of the independent community bankers of america in las vegas .
andre w. lewis , whose father 's first cousin is powell and who considers the prominent leader his uncle , has been hired as deputy political director of the davis re - election committee .
davis campaign adviser garry south said the governor did not know of lewis ' connection to powell until after he was hired .
that 's not why we hired him , " south said .
lewis , who is working at davis ' los angeles campaign headquarters , declined to comment , and the campaign referred questions to south .
he does n't wear it on his sleeve , but he 's obviously proud of him , " south said .
gov. davis ' campaign is fined $ 50,000 the fair political practices commission fined gov. gray davis ' campaign committee $ 50,000 yesterday for campaign reporting violations during his 1998 gubernatorial election .
campaign officials also did not itemize more than $ 9 million paid to consultants to buy television campaign spots .
the campaign also failed to show proof that it told major contributors that they had to file separate donation disclosures .
a spokesman for davis ' committee , gabriel sanchez , said the campaign did not intentional violate campaign laws .
consumer groups , led by the san diego - based utility consumers ' action network , say the governor 's plan does not go far enough , particularly because sdg&e earned an estimated $ 400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis .
lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be " just and reasonable .
the pact between edison and the california public utilities commission also might presage a nimbler puc , one likelier to strike closed - door deals without its typical months of testimony , briefs and hearings .
one week after a federal judge approved the $ 6.35 billion pact to restore edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control , it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers .
it was negotiated in secret , approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward , even some puc analysts were still debating just how much money was involved .
and the puc settlement took a much broader view of edison 's finances , sweeping in old debts and cash on hand , and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off $ 6.35 billion in debts .
people 's calculus was shaken up by what pg&e did , " said mike florio , an attorney for the utility reform network , a consumer group .
it was just in the ether that ' oh god , there 's something really ugly out there .
at a closed session before approving it , he said , every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process , full information and proper hearings .
it scares the hell out of me what a really pro - utility commission would do with this , " said florio , the consumer advocate .

people all around us are ignoring the god who loves them and wants to guide their lives and are instead seeking light and peace in the kingdom of darkness .
do n't be carried away by the prospect of knowledge and power which is luring so many people in our culture today away from god .
other people will thirst after power to such an extent that they will sacrifice to the " goat demons " ( leviticus 17:7 ) and even sacrifice their own children to demons ( psalm 106:36 - 38 ) .
let the words of deuteronomy 32:17 , 18 , sober us to the reality that even believers are vulnerable to being lured away from the knowledge and power of god by our enemy .

top story : interview with monica crowley and ellis henican fox news :
but democratic operatives have been urging mr. lieberman , as the best - placed committee chairman , to dig into the issue , believing further exposure can only embarrass republicans and mr. bush , whose own ties to enron and mr. lay date back to the president 's race for texas governor .
that is at least partly because the houston company had invested a lot of time and money in washington to keep the government out of its business , and to foster gop support for deregulation of energy and financial industries .
al gore 's presidential campaign against mr. bush received $ 13,700 from enron executives during the 2000 campaign cycle ; mr. bush 's campaign got $ 114,000 and his party far more .
the democrats ' rhetorical line of attack is already clear .
the only wholly owned subsidiary of enron not to go bankrupt is the republican party , " said robert gibbs , a spokesman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee .
while he too emphasized a desire to remain bipartisan , he announced the hearings without his committee 's chief republican , sen. fred thompson of tennessee .
the democrat driving the issue to date has been rep. henry waxman of california , but he is hampered by the fact that democrats are the minority in the house .
mr. waxman and other democrats on the house government reform committee also started an " enron tip - line " to solicit information about any alleged wrongdoing .
last friday , in answer to a reporter 's question , mr. bush said enron must be held accountable .
and the decision of mr. bush 's successor , gov. rick perry , to appoint a former top enron executive as chairman of the texas public utility commission has produced a storm of protest .
moreover , he 's now seeking the senate seat held by republican sen. phil gramm , who is retiring .
earlier this year , the state 's democratic attorney general , william lockyer , subpoenaed enron 's electricity - trading records in an attempt to show that the state was a victim of price gouging .
on average , employees had more than 60 % of their retirement savings in enron shares , and because they had little flexibility to diversify or sell , many lost as much as 90 % of their retirement assets when the share price plunged .

while lieberman said the committee has not decided whether to ask enron chairman kenneth lay or other company executives to testify , he did note that he " would n't consider an investigation complete without hearing from them .

several us senators have called for the department of justice to investigate the share dealings of enron corp 's senior executives and to also probe why an employee pension fund was locked down at a time when executives continued to sell their enron stock holdings as the company 's fortunes dwindled .
thousands of employees of enron have lost their jobs , many thousands more have had their retirement savings evaporated .
enron retirees have told lawmakers that the company 's executive board locked them out of accessing their 401(k ) pension funds when enron 's fortunes started to spiral downwards into bankruptcy .
retirees and some lawmakers , allege that enron chairman and chief executive officer kenneth lay and other executives shed millions of dollars in stock while they were locked out from accessing their retirement benefits over this period .
senate committee to investigate enron collapse by h. josef hebert associated press writer 01/03/2002
sen. joseph lieberman , who chairs the full government affairs committee , did not rule out looking into connections between enron and the administration of george w. bush .
houston - based enron is under investigation in washington by at least five congressional committees , the market - regulating securities and exchange commission and the departments of justice and labor .
donations of this type reflect certain political realities which are followed by all major corporations , " mr. bennett said yesterday about enron 's us$ 50,000 cheques on nov. 25 and nov. 26 to the democratic senatorial campaign committee .
enron opposes the request to order mr. mcmahon 's testimony , calling it " unnecessary , unduly burdensome , and disruptive . "
courts have repeatedly recognized that demands for depositions of high - ranking corporate officers are often misused as a tool of harassment and should not be allowed unless there is no other source for the same information , " enron said in a motion filed monday seeking to quash the request .

something was rotten in the state of enron , and a lot of knowledgeable people on wall street were either duped , did n't care , or purposefully went along for the ride .
but the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts , including professor lynn turner , a former securities and exchange commission chief accountant and current director of the center for quality financial reporting at colorado state university .
enron asset holdings , an enron subsidiary that is not part of the energy company 's bankruptcy , owns 47.5 % of the plant , and edison mission energy , a unit of edison international , owns 50 % .
mirant initially disclosed its intent to terminate the deal in a dec. 20 press release detailing its effort to beef up its balance sheet .
that 's because enron 's bankruptcy has forced the former energy giant to put its power assets up for sale , undercutting efforts by mirant and other companies trying to unload plants and pipelines .

less than a year after the nation 's most - populous state , california , endured blackouts and political and economic turmoil when it deregulated the power industry , the second - most - populous state , texas , this week began its own deregulation plan with officials promising that there would be no reprise of california 's chaos .
terry hadley , spokesman for the texas public utility commission , the agency overseeing the electricity marketplace , said electricity retailers were ' ' sharpening their pencils to see what kind of offers they can make . '
this savings is built into the ' ' price to beat , ' ' the state - mandated price per kilowatt hour that the old utilities will be allowed to charge under deregulation to keep their customers .
in california , the state deregulated the wholesale power market while keeping retail prices capped .
this caused the state 's two biggest public utilities to lose billions of dollars when wholesale prices spiked and the retail price caps prevented them from passing the costs along to consumers .
california officials , including gov. gray davis , also accused several energy companies , including enron , of manipulating prices and making the state 's problems worse , a charge the companies denied .
the state endured rolling blackouts and other problems before federal regulators ordered restraints on electricity prices last summer .
the texas public utility commission has been in the spotlight recently because of questions of whether its chairman , max yzaguirre , a former enron executive appointed by gov. rick perry , misrepresented his connections to the company on state disclosure forms .
thousands of enron employees were left with no nest egg , but it was just one company and there is no reason to believe that the off - balance - sheet deals that caused its demise are systemic .
part of the reason for the reluctance to enact laws , even in the face of public outrage , is the pro - business , anti - regulatory bent of a majority republican congress .
if that exemption were repealed , it would have the same effect as a cap , " said eli gottesdiener , an attorney leading one of four employee lawsuits against enron .
there are not many e - commerce companies left standing , let alone ones that have met their forecasts , ' '
at espeed , where his 2000 salary was $ 350,000 and his bonus was $ 650,000 , his 2001 compensation has not yet been made public .
well before the attacks , cantor had begun to shift its core business , trading government and corporate bonds for big institutional clients , from expensive human traders to the less - expensive electronic trading system operated by espeed .
though espeed itself lost about 180 of its 477 worldwide employees , it was nevertheless able to resume operations within 48 hours of the attacks . ' '
but mr. lutnick says espeed is still ' ' the dominant system for trading u.s. treasury securities around the country , ' ' and wall street analysts generally agree .
michael bloomberg , an unlikely politician who made his name and fortune as chief executive of a media empire , took over as mayor of new york tuesday and immediately introduced a ceo 's mentality to city hall .
mayor mike said he would cut his own staff by 20 % and urged other elected officials to do the same .
as his once - trusted aides resign in disgrace and the city declares bankruptcy , bloomberg will insist that he did n't know anything about how the government was being run .
despite the apparent absurdity of the claim , most people will believe him .
so what if city services regularly crash for no reason ?

Dabhol India - Illegal Action and Criminal Conduct / violation of human rights
i also perused enron 's concept of " know why " .
i was always ensuring the high dignity and value that was attached to my job including of respect , integrity , communication and excellence .
however , despite that , the officer in - charge at dabhol complex for reasons best known to him developed vengeance against me and on 17th august 2001 , my services were illegally terminated by unilaterally and while acting out of the capacity , imposing an alleged severance plan with effect from 17th august 2001 itself which was never disclosed to me or accepted by me .
subsequently , i was forced upon a cheque of severance amount on 27th august 2001 which i received under protest and the notice of such protest was served by me on firm in the interest of justice .
i submit such a termination is illegal , bad in law and void ab - initio and accordingly and when such an action was not corrected by firm , i constrained to approach the court of law .
re : criminal conduct / violation to human rights : on 27th august 2001 , subsequent to my protest representation , i was criminally man handled by officers of the firm / enron namely kenneth d. lambert , p r krishna murthy , capt .
besides other criminal acts , i was criminally insulted , detained , physically hurted by these persons inasmuch as , security was ordered to place a guard on me and at my house .
i was not allowed to go back to my house and my access was blocked and i was thrown out of the colony premises in night without any aid or consideration and out of no fault of me .
police also registered a criminal offence under various sections of indian penal code at police station against these four persons for atrocities and violation of human rights on me .

what it comes down to at this point is ferc is the only entity with the authority to start fixing this problem now :
the regular september national charity league patroness meeting will be held monday , september 18 , 2000 , 7:30 p.m. , at cypress creek christian church community center .
the following are summaries of today 's appearance by sen. john burton to the sacramento press club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against ferc .
burton is obviously troubled by the mou ; he said " some people " say it does n't just make edison creditworthy , it makes them whole .
he said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more ( note : this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media ) .
the state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar , he said , so this is one way he sees to fight back .
clark kelso , a constitutional scholar from mcgeorge school of law ; sen. liz figueroa ; and joan breuner , vice mayor of oakland .
joe cotchett said the suit is " very basic " and is based on the federal power act , which he says limits power costs to " fair and justifiable " rates .
he also claimed that a redondo beach facility ( obviously aes ) was fined $ 8 million by ferc for taking its plant off - line and substituting higher rates .
burton had mentioned clark kelso , who regularly appears on tv here as a legal expert and i believe was a colleague of justice anthony kennedy , in his press club appearance .
kelso said this is not a partisan issue , and called upon " fellow republicans " to support the effort .
men of genius are often dull and inert in society , as a blazing meteor when it descends to earth , is only a stone .

well , the answer very clearly is no .
i have been astounded by repeated attempts of sdg&e?s most senior people to ape humans , but instead they mimic apes .
again , mr cotton tells his fellow iso governing board members that these things take time , and we don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers , and , well , the surfing was good this week
now they are in a panic because the energy f_hrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks , advising them not to pay their sdg&e electricity bill , and to continue to operate their air conditioners .
i always thought the location of the iso was a state secret for security reasons .
the primary reason is that western power markets are not workably competitive .
so , to recap , sdg&e missed the boat on price hedging , failed to win consumer confidence in public meetings , asked for help from suppliers and did nothing in response , then filed at ferc to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell ( over - priced ? )
hot weather , aging power plant and transmission infrastructure , and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up ...
past administrations ' willingness to cede the state 's authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two non - public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer .
the " independent system operator " ( iso ) and the " power exchange " ( px ) , the nonprofit private corporations that operate the state 's transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies , are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest .
neither of these private organizations is accountable to the state or its consumers ....
despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the state 's electric services , the state of california should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing ;
_ california consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as san diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double .
ask ferc to recognize the defects in the california and western regional markets and find that no competitive market exists in california power markets ; ...
streamline state power plant siting procedures ; consistent with environmental requirements , and prioritize applications to advance clean , bact+ power plant proposals .
it seems the only time the board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda : price caps , ftrs , and priorities for software enhancements .

he said he knew how prices and markets work , that it isn?t the way those academic egg - head , ferc - loving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition .
this man makes relevant all the abstract musings of the philosopher friedrich nietzsche ( 1844 - 1900 ) ...
that?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step away from our front door .
ferc issued a last minute reply to the complaint by morgan stanley capital group relating to the iso?s intent to lower the price cap .
ferc denied the complaint , but they didn?t waste time with an order to simply deny a complaint .
ferc danced on the head of the iso and pulled the bite out of the price cap .
here are some excerpts : _ we accepted this [ amendment 21 ] , not because it was a cap on sellers ?
( e.g. , when system load exceeds 38,000 mw ) , such a requirement is not permitted by our ... order and the iso tariff . ...
here is what the sleeping bear , commissioner hebert said in his concurring remarks :
a memorandum to the iso from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the iso .
we must also take notice of the public pressure on the board to compromise its independence .

modern legal authors tend not to use the term " hedging exception " anymore , but more broadly refer to economically justified transactions .
borsentermingeschafte are binding on both parties if each party is a merchant , and is either registered or not subject to registration because he / it is a foreign resident or a public law entity , or a professional ( defined as a person who , at the time of the transaction or prior thereto , traded in futures commercially or professionally , or is permanently admitted to engage in exchange - trading ) .
this technique of entering a valid agreement is commonly referred to as the " information model " and is subject to strict and ongoing form requirements .
the term also requires clarification in light of recent amendments to the securities trading act ( wertpapierhandelsgesetz ) and the banking act ( kreditwesengesetz ) , implementing into german law the ec investment services directive ( isd ) and the ec capital adequacy directive ( cad ) , which introduced the distinguishable supervisory law term " derivative , " narrowly defined , into the two acts .
the proposal took banks by surprise the absence of a standard methodology led to fears of an arbitrary operational risk charge , supplementary to existing capital charges for credit and market risk , based on size and volume .
allen wheat , chief executive officer and chairman of credit suisse first boston , speaking at risk 's annual european congress in paris last april , described the proposal for an operational risk capital charge as " the dopiest thing i 've ever seen " .
similarly , operational risk capital charges could penalise banks competing against non - banking organisations not subject to the charge .
according to richard metcalfe , isda assistant director of european policy : " there is concern that , while the proposed basle committee rules incentivise data gathering , that is not the only issued if banks record their losses in general categories when submitting internal data but do not associate losses with enough contextual information , it we be difficult to understand the finer gradations of risk later on - or indeed to reclassify the database to an agreed industry or regulatory standard .
depending on the stance of regulators , the committee might insist that policies that mitigate the capital charge pay out immediately after any operational disaster , or that these polices only cover certain classes of operational risk .

now skilling is pushing the company into internet trading of all sorts of things : paper products , plastics , metals , fiber - optic bandwidth , commercial credit , pollution emission controls , and even weather derivatives .
enron cloaks the details of that business in secrecy , citing competitive reasons , which makes its bread - and - butter activities as difficult to understand as the abstract joan miro lithograph that looms behind skilling 's desk .
' besides , he said , enron merely trades and does n't produce power in california .
` ` california has been a feeding frenzy , with every trading company in the world feasting on it , and enron is the biggest and shrewdest of them all , ' ' said michael shames , executive director of the utility consumers ' action network .

` ` i see no reason why anyone should wear weather risk when they hedge away things like currency fluctuations , ' '
` ` in this business , infrastructure continually changes , and enron seems to be ignoring that because it interferes with the propaganda they 're trying to spread . ' ' $ 36 billion value for business so far , the results do n't seem to justify skilling 's $ 36 billion value for the business .

last week , dabhol 's board authorized the company to issue a termination notice to its sole customer , the mseb .
the newspaper also said indian term - lenders to dabhol had written to the federal government asking it to honour its counter - guarantee and pay 1.02 billion rupees owed to dabhol by mseb for power bought in december .
to defuse dabhol crisis indian lenders to the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) have asked the government to honour its counterguarantee to end the impasse over the project .
enron , though the state government yet to communicate to them about the renegotiating panel officially , has informally expressed its willingness for renegotiations , a senior official from the states administration informed et on monday .

- india 's enron - backed dabhol power company ( dpc ) said it is " not interested " in completing the us$ 3 billion power project in india 's western state of maharashtra , following non - payment of dues by the state electricity board ( mseb ) and the federal government 's refusal to honour the rs 1.02 billion counter - guarantee .
` ` nothing stops us from going to europe and the us . ' '
alongside , he said , the bank discusses the tax reform , expenditure management , debt management including restructuring and reform of state - owned enterprises .
he , however , said that the bank undertakes power sector programme with the state government concerned only after thoroughly satisfying itself with various parameters of the concerned state 's commitment to reform in the sector .
the persons on the panel include mr vinay bansal , chairman , maharashtra state electricity board , mr sudhir shrivastava , secretary , expenditure , and mr ashok lavasa , joint secretary in the economic cell at the centre , apart from all the members of the godbole committee .
the energy review committee headed by dr madhav godbole had mr e.a.s sarma , mr deepak parekh , mr rajendra pachauri , mr v.m. lal and mr kirit parikh as members .

as anticipated , iraq ceased exporting oil under the un - controlled " oil for food " program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security council 's sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule .
iraq 's pricing was judged by the un overseers , who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee , to be about 60 cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that iraq was seeking from buyers .
( in the midst of this dispute , the un security council approved phase nine of the oil - for - food program at the last minute on december 5 ; it became effective on december 6 and has been accepted by iraq ) .
additionally , the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow account would be a violation of un sanctions .
as currently structured , the deal would violate un sanctions , but india is seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic hardship .

lawmakers try a new idea : a lawsuit arguing that blackouts pose danger to people , law enforcement and even water supply .
legislative democrats today will sue federal energy regulators , charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing homes , children in day care centers , law enforcement and its ability to fight crime , and the state 's drinking water supplies .
the action is being filed by veteran trial attorney joe cotchett on behalf of senate president pro tem john burton ( d - san francisco ) , assembly speaker bob hertzberg ( d - sherman oaks ) , and the city of oakland .
the public health , safety and welfare of the state 's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of rolling blackouts and punitive prices .
suit says blackouts pose threats until now , most california officials , including gov. gray davis , have been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a way of limiting costs to the state , which has spent more than $ 6 billion buying electricity since january .
in the lawsuit , cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes , frail elderly people " are left to wonder if their oxygen tanks , drip ivs , dialysis machines and electricity - powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed . "
let 's face it , " said kelso , a republican , " this is the single most important issue that the state faces for the next six months .
the suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the implications of blackouts , including one the state department of health services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide .
the warning suggests that if people are concerned about water quality , they can boil it or add " eight drops of household bleach to one gallon of water , and let it sit for 30 minutes .

these ballots are ( mostly ) not the result of confused individuals .
in reality , double - punching a ballot is standard procedure for election workers to invalidate a ballot that were punched in error .
if you punch out the hole for someone , and then change your mind before putting the card in the box , and you ask an official for another card , the old card ( with your mistake ) is deliberately double - punched so that it should n't accidentally be counted .
in other words , gore 's claim that 19,000 of his supporters are having their votes discarded is completely bogus .
while i 'm sure some of the double - punches were from clueless voters , it is completely wrong when the media says that this is the case for all 19,000 of them ( souce for the 1996 figure : - regarding the " illegal " butterfly ballot that the gore people want invalidated ( to call for a re - vote in palm beach ) , they are conveniently ignoring some of that law .

' corporate taxes are not rising along with profits because companies have found all sorts of ways to get around the reforms in the 1986 tax act , ' ' said robert s. mcintyre , the director of citizens for tax justice . '
timothy mccormally of the tax executives institute , which represents officials at large companies , told bloomberg news that the companies named in the report did nothing wrong . ' '
there is nothing in the report that suggests that any of this results from any illegal or improper activity , ' ' he said .
the study by the washington institute showed that the corporate tax burden was falling in many cases because of the growing use of stock options , which are an expense for tax purposes but do not count against profits reported to shareholders .

state and federal regulators are conducting separate investigations into california 's wholesale power crisis .
their investigation is n't turning up much evidence but earnings statements are showing that profits are up significantly largely due to wholesale prices in california , the source said .
at least one federal energy regulatory commissioner , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said the wholesale electricity market in california will be in for a " rude awakening " when the agency completes its investigation .
representatives from energy companies told dow jones newswires that higher profits were n't the result of illegal activity or manipulating the market .

the puc makes sdg&e a party to the urg aspects of its order , while the puc does not apply the dwr delivery and pricing rules to sdg&e , at this time .
the ab 1x law does not exclude sdg&e*s retail customers from receiving dwr power , but the puc opts not to require dwr power to go them at this time .
in this interim order adopted on 01/31/01 , the puc says it does not end the rate freeze , set an interim valuation , or otherwise provide a basis for ending the rate freeze .
residual pricing of dwr power because of the provisions of ab 1x , which was enacted the day after the puc adopted its order , the puc must price dwr power residually , or as a percentage of what each sce and pg&e retail end use customer currently pays them for energy .
as the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on the basis of the megawatt hours dwr actually purchases and delivers , while calculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from
following the provisions of ab 1x , the puc sets the dwr price of power upon resale as equal to dwr*s purchased power costs , plus administrative costs , transmission and scheduling costs , and other related costs , less any overpayments dwr may subsequently recover from suppliers .
again following the provisions of ab 1x , the puc directs dwr to retain title to its power until sold to the utilities

but she has given up the glory trail to become india 's most prominent activist , campaigning against nuclear tests and the dams that threaten the homes and li madeleine bunting 07/28/2001
it was the god of small things , and it earned her one of india 's biggest ever advances before going on to win the booker prize and sell six million copies .
roy is accused of inciting violence and attacking a court official .
what induced her to swap her status as delhi 's most - favoured dinner party guest for night marches and sit - ins at the dam sites , and even , possibly , jail ?
why did the whimsical chronicler of " small things " - the beetles and creeping , lush greenery of kerala - turn to fighting big things such as nuclear bombs , dams , the indian state and globalisation ?
here , where she writes and spends most of her day , she has none of the small army of servants considered necessary by middle - class delhi .
it 's a sharp contrast to the vehemence and coruscating wit of her writing .
i like the fact that my rage goes into bigger things , not into small , petty things with people around me , " she says .
and once you 've seen it , keeping quiet , saying nothing , becomes as political an act as speaking out .
what anchored her as she spun around the globe was home , and she resisted the temptations of emigration .
the title was misplaced , however , because what then captured her imagination , and has done ever since , was that the biggest mass non - violent movement since indian independence - the campaign against the narmada valley dams - was then on the brink of victory .
like any writer , she wants to understand and tell stories , and dams sum up , like nothing else , the story of modern india : its greed , its wanton violence and its centralisation of power .
it was just a slow , sludging green ribbon lawn that ferried fetid garbage to the sea .
bombs and dams are the corollary of india 's slums : the bombs have diverted the taxes , and the dams have deprived millions of their lands and their rivers .
despite the legal cases , and the veiled threats and savage attacks in the media , even by erstwhile allies , roy is standing her ground .
the end of imagination in 1998 won her many admirers in the west , but in india it failed to dent the extraordinary consensus behind the nuclear bomb .
over the next few weeks , police will have to drag people from their homes to prevent suicide protests by drowning : " while the judges are discussing our contempt of court case , people will stand chest - deep in water for days .
in reality , many of those who lose their lands or livelihoods are likely to receive nothing more than paltry financial compensation .
in reality , the dams will provide electricity and water for the prospering urban industrial interests of the state - which is why the supreme court judgment was greeted with jubilation in gujarat 's cities .
enron was accused of smoothing the path of its massive contract to build a power plant near bombay with dollars 20 m to " educate " politicians and bureaucrats ; now the electricity enron produces is more expensive than any of its competitors ' , yet maharastra state is locked into contractual payments of dollars 220 m a year .
the lobotomy in the west is that you stop seeing something and then , slowly , it 's not possible to see it .
that 's why they could n't forgive her and her mother when she was growing up in kerala , she remembers - they simply were n't as unhappy as a single mother and her " thin , black , clever " daughter should have been .
i remember what my mother said to me : ' i 've never known anyone who guards their happiness so fiercely . '
i think it 's important to patrol the borders of your happiness , to understand your sources of joy and to protect them , and to know that , so often , it 's only when that happiness has gone that you know what it was .
she describes her friends as " extraordinary people " for dealing with her sudden fame and money , and managing to maintain the " democratic nature of our friendships " .
none of them had money before , now she gives hers away , " and i know that it is as sophisticated an act to receive as to give it " .
she has probably made enough from the one novel to live on for the rest of her life ; she eschewed more , refusing to sell the film rights , arguing democratically that six million readers had their own version of the film in their heads and she did n't want a single film - maker to replace them all .
the fame has been burdensome , although she claims ( somewhat implausibly , since she had her hair cut , a symbol of rare defiance in a culture that fetishises long hair ) that she has some anonymity in india ( when asked if she is arundhati roy , she says her standard reply is that she wishes she were ) .
the most important thing , she says , is to keep in mind your own insignificance ; she ca n't speak about every issue and do them all justice .
she lambasts the pact of mediocrity to which the vast majority of people subscribe in their marriages , and confesses herself bewildered as to why so many women have children .
i use it to live my life in the most public and the most private way , and i love all different kinds of writing : a novel , an affidavit , a letter .
it is roy 's passion for writing that stiffened her resolve not to take the lawyers ' advice and apologise to the supreme court , and she describes a poignantly revealing dream she had before the last hearing :
it is dark when we finish talking , and the apartment block is silent .
and never , never to forget . '
the godbole panel today conveyed the power - offtake proposals of six states to dabhol power company ( dpc ) officials .
in a clear reference to its estranged relationship and bitter battle with mseb and state government over unpaid dues upto usd 45 million , enron said failure to reform power sector in india , especially in western state of maharashtra , makes it " extremely difficult " for an outside generator to operate effectively .

while mulholland often gets all the ink ( good and bad ) , it was actually ezra frederick scattergood who is the " father of municipal power " in los angeles .
fact : until 1942 , hydroelectric power from the hoover dam supplied 75 percent of the electricity for los angeles .
fact : angelenos consume less power per capita than any other residents of california .
today , the city of angels is run on coal , which supplies half of l.a. 's power , from three jumbo generating stations in the desert in utah , nevada and arizona .

febeliec got a letter back saying that the govt was " disappointed and unhappy " with the letter , noting that the govt priorities were the belgian presidency of the eu , the finances of the communes ( whose finances are of course completely wrapped up with electrabel 's extraction of revenues from captive customers ) and something along the lines of " preserving the traditions of belgian electricity supply " .
furthermore , there are suggestions of veiled threats ( not from the government directly , but from those working closely with govt ) of " retribution " ( taxes / environmental burdens ) -presumably if febeliec do n't lay off .
against this background , the creg refusal to meet with enron is obviously symptomatic of the general attitude of the govt .

we presented the situation - no access to market / transit , quasi monopoly situation at the detriment to consumers , no wholesale and retail market , no wholesale trading allowed .
in particular , at the end of the meeting m. vanderverren told me that the government had no intention of opening up the market for competition and that their only intention was to focus on internal market issues , and not border issues , to insure the transposition of the directive to fend off the commission 's latest infringement action .
the creg continues to claim that they are not able to impose any rules or regulation on cpte as cpte is not the nominated tso .
it seemed that lekane did not understand the issue and implied that his comments on the grid code did not envisage that because of the limited time they had to offer comments to the ministry .

becker many well - meaning americans , including college students and religious organizations , have attacked nike inc. and other companies accused of using child labor in their overseas plants in poor nations .

child - labor critics could spend their time more fruitfully by attacking not the overseas employment policies of multinationals but the social policies of governments in poor nations that are really responsible for the prevalence of child labor there .

the washington post , 02/22/2002 enron unit investment made profit for jeb bush houston chronicle , 02/22/2002 enron has deal to sell wind unit / ge purchasing one of largest assets left houston chronicle , 02/21/2002
the washington post co. all rights reserved florida gov. jeb bush invested in a publicly traded enron corp. partnership in 1995 and turned a modest profit before selling it less than a year later .
former enron president richard kinder -- who recently hosted a $ 500-a - person political fundraiser for bush in houston -- now controls enron liquids pipeline .
president bush said last month that his mother - in - law was among enron corp. stockholders who lost money on the failed company -- about $ 8,100 .
in a state whose pension fund lost more than $ 300 million in the collapse , bush 's fund - raising trip to the houston home of former enron president richard kinder " rubs in the face of people who lost their life savings , " the chairman of the florida democratic party said last month .
the two men have run into each other occasionally at public events and they have never had any business relationship , he added .
what democrats are doing nationally in trying to capitalize on the suffering of enron employees for their own cheap political gain is absolutely shameful , " said karen unger , the governor 's campaign manager .

the lawmakers - u.s. sen. barbara boxer , d - calif . , and john burton , president pro tempore of the california state senate - asked attorney general janet reno to take " immediate steps " to investigate california markets for electricity and natural gas .
the lawmakers questioned whether repairs or maintenance were truly behind why a quarter of the state 's generating plants were n't operating in recent weeks , contributing to the latest power - supply emergency in california .
the department of justice must act to ensure that collusion and other unlawful acts are not contributing to the crisis in california 's power markets , " they told reno .
neither the california independent system operator nor officials in the pacific northwest found any evidence of price - gouging in separate investigations they conducted , church noted .

he depicted that " new " votes " recovered " in the broward county manual recount of rejected ballots were , even under that county 's less strict standard , biased toward mr. bush relative to the votes before the manual recount : mr. bush had 34 % of the new ( i.e. " recovered " ) votes , versus 31 % of the votes before the manual recount .
the issue was where you set the cut - off point , and ignore incompetence .
the democratic party has a practice of assigning no cut - off point , as if rounding up derelicts to cast meaningless votes .
it 's as if mr. gore was trying to get elected by assigning purposefulness to incompetents , in the face of evidence that competence was biasing votes toward mr. bush .

bowden said he spoke with lowder " weekly , if not daily " during his first two or three seasons , but " never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that i should do it .

jones)- california attorney general bill lockyer has yet to present a criminal grand jury with charges electricity generators illegally manipulated the state 's wholesale power market , because his office still lacks substantial evidence , persons familiar with the matter told dow jones newswires on thursday .
but one person close to the state 's investigation said it 's become increasingly clear that pursuing criminal charges against generators is " a dead issue , " with civil suits appearing to be a better approach .
the person close to the investigation said evidence that the california independent system operator , manager of the state 's electricity grid , routinely ordered generators to reduce output at some power plants may have hampered efforts to bring criminal charges .
the energy companies have denied wrongdoing , saying power prices spiked because demand outstripped supply .

california government blamed most for energy crisis , poll finds washington , aug. 9 ( bloomberg ) -- almost twice as many americans believe california government officials are responsible for the state 's energy crisis than blame power generators or local utilities , a bloomberg news poll found .
one - third of those surveyed said that the state government bears most responsibility for the energy woes , while 19 percent blamed power - generating companies .
the results come despite months of criticism of out of state power generators and republicans in washington by democratic california governor gray davis , who has accused firms such as enron corp. , duke energy corp. , dynegy inc. , reliant energy inc. and williams cos . of manipulating the wholesale energy market .
davis is pressing federal regulators to order energy companies to refund $ 9.8 billion to the state , claiming energy companies overcharged california and its utilities for electricity .
social security reform was cited by 20 percent , and adding prescription drug coverage to medicare was cited by 19 percent as the most pressing issue facing the country 's policy - makers , the poll found .

yet , unlike many peoples that have adapted and evolved in response to external and internal influences over the centuries , the aggies have largely remained true to their roots .
as a result of passing on their beliefs and practices over the years , their behavior over time has been remarkably consistent .
contrary to widespread belief , the aggies are considered , and consider themselves , a separate people from the morons , idiots , and okies .
the misconception that the four groups are related probably stems from the fact that morons and idiots have imitated many rituals and behaviors practiced by the aggies .
the history of the aggie school of thought actually begins in ancient greece , with the early philospher slocumedes , who was the first to recognize that the absence of everything is equivalent to nothing .
part of the problem in identifying an aggie is that they look and act much like anyone else until they do or say something decidedly stupid .
the majority of the times a aggie turns out to be nothing more than an inconvenience and source of humor to the innocent bystander .

the bill would have prohibited an employer to count any sick leave taken by an employee to tend to a sick child , parent or spouse in any absence control program current law permits an employee to use half of their annual accrued sick leave in a calendar year to attend to the illness of a child , parent , or spouse who would not otherwise qualify under the family medical leave act that only applies to serious health conditions .
however , employers opposed the bill because many employees take advantage of the easy threshold and use it to avoid workplace sanctions .
after the above provision became law , employers began to see a steady rise in the use and abuse of sick leave under this provision , so employers decided to include sick leave in their employee absence control programs in order to eliminate the abuse .
making a decision to sanction an employee under an absence control policy is not taken lightly by employers and must be based on sound reasoning .
in other instances , it is used to cover for tardiness that would otherwise be sanctioned under the employer absence control program by calling in just before the shift begins in order to start the shift late .
consider that employers are not required to provide sick leave and the bill would only apply to those employers who voluntarily provide sick leave for their employees .

california has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs . ? ?
on wednesday , the state got more bad economic news : the ucla anderson business forecast said californians would face higher taxes and a tighter state budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency power .
the blackouts and the state 's scrutiny of private power suppliers also threaten to scare away new businesses , the report said . ? ?
it would tax gross receipts that ' ' significantly exceed ' ' the cost of producing power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold it at much higher rates . ? ? ' '

davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that manner , ' ' but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense .
two hundred of the finest economic minds in california gathered wednesday at ucla 's anderson school of management to discuss the state 's energy crisis but , as state public utilities commission president loretta lynch spoke , the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly . ? ?
i do n't have any control over this , " the beleaguered technician operating the sound system called out after repeated outages . ? ?
after two rounds of rolling blackouts that state officials were powerless to prevent , lynch last week led the commission to hike retail power rates 42 percent , sparking protests from consumer groups . ? ?
she promised to lead " a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out of the california economy and not adding a whit of value . " ? ?
lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were ended by the federal energy rate commission in december but was n't counting on that . ? ?
even without those caps , she said she was optimistic that the state had enough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate hike . ? ?
lynch dismissed the state 's 1996 deregulation plan as a " failed experiment " and said she did not accept a questioner 's premise that " true deregulation is our goal .
the problem was that " the state stepped back too much " from management of the power system and that there had been " too much ideology and theory and not enough practical solutions , " she added . ? ?

the circumstances described in 7.2 are not a legitimate ground for refusal .

what we 're wondering , though , is why do the media -- this cnn report is just one example -- invariably refer to clark as a " civil rights advocate " ?

rappers for america london 's guardian reports that rap music -- once a genre whose politics consisted mostly of violent opposition to authority -- has become patriotic in the wake of sept. 11 .
they announced that anybody wearing the flag , which they described as " violent gang colours " , would not be admitted to their shows .
predictably , they have not had quite as many invitations to appear on tv as hammer , and they recently accused magazines such as rolling stone of diluting their statements to make them more palatable .
crucially , though , the coup and the handful of other anti - war rappers sell relatively little , and to a predominately white , liberal fanbase , a sub - genre known as backpacker hip - hop .
in an interview with the times of london , film director robert altman sounds off on politics :
when i see an american flag flying , it 's a joke .
first off is sandy tolan , an " independent journalist and radio documentary producer " who penned a usa today column denouncing the media for being too patriotic .
she 's critical of journalists who think the pentagon would tell the truth , but she 's all for dubious sources -- as long as they 're anti - american :
a careful reading of american newspapers finds repeated instances in which dozens , even hundreds , of civilians have been killed by u.s. bombs .
the bombings are often covered as " collateral " damage that " happens in war .
other times , pentagon denials coming out of washington are given equal credibility with eyewitness reports from anti - taliban villagers on the ground ; the story dissolves into a false balance of he - said , she - said .
unlike in europe , the u.s. press rarely focuses on the growing rage over bombs falling on civilians .
but how else do we explain that , in early december , the british journalist robert fisk was nearly beaten to death by bombed - out afghan refugees just inside the pakistani border ?
* * the new hampshire " study " she cites is pure junk science ; it bases its conclusions on such sources of " information " as the pro - islamist al - jazeera news network .
as for fisk , she accepts at face value this notoriously anti - american writer 's ideologically self - serving interpretation of his beating , which , as we noted , sounded to us like a simple robbery attempt .
* * quote * * * minus the torture , the united states is now doing what most arab regimes have been doing for decades : arresting their brutal " islamist " enemies , holding them incommunicado , chained and hooded , while preparing unfair trials .
* * yeah , well , minus the brains , this fisk is a regular einstein , is n't he ?

* * well , cheers for rudy and tony , but it 's ridiculous to downplay the efforts of president bush , who is unquestionably the leader of the war .
moreover , miller seems unaware that air force one went to nebraska at the urging of the secret service , and it was bush who insisted on returning to washington on the night of sept. 11 .

a former smith barney employee is entitled to a trial to decide whether his bipolar affective disorder is a mental illness subject to a 24-month cap on benefits under a long - term disability policy or a physical illness not subject to a cap , the arkansas supreme court rules unanimously ( " elam v. first unum life ins . co. , " ark. , no . 00 - 1430 , 10/18/01 ) .
reversing summary judgment for first unum life insurance co. , the supreme court holds that because both the insurer and james elam submitted evidence outside of the insurance policy to support their interpretations of the term " mental illness , " the issue is a question of fact for a jury to decide .
a former truck driver 's attempt to separate claims he brought under the fair labor standards act and the labor - management relations act in order to avail himself of the flsa 's two - year statute of limitations falls short , as the sixth circuit finds the wage claim barred by the federal labor law 's six - month limitations period ( " martin v. lake county sewer co. , " 6th cir . , no . 00 - 00228 , 10/17/01 ) .
in addition to seeking unpaid wages under the flsa after his discharge , donald martin charged his former employer , lake county sewer co. , with violating the terms of its collective bargaining agreement with a teamsters local in violation of lmra section 301 .
martin also contended that the union violated its duty of fair representation under section 301 by failing to pursue a grievance against lake for allegedly improper deductions in his benefits and pay .
martin argues his flsa claim is distinct from the section 301 claim and therefore governed by the wage law 's two - year limitations period .
a nurse 's assistant who was sexually assaulted by a co - worker can proceed with a series of claims against an upstate new york health care facility , despite the fact that the employer immediately suspended and later discharged the alleged attacker , a federal magistrate judge rules ( " becker v. ulster county , " n.d. n.y. , no . 99-cv-1278 , 10/10/01 ) .
rejecting a summary judgment motion by ulster county golden hill health care center , judge homer of the u.s. district court for the northern district of new york finds that gail becker established enough evidence to go to trial on her claims of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment and retaliation under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act and other laws .

stuart ( who was also speaking for john nowlan ) wants to arrest the vessel as it arrives in kuantan , west malaysia to discharge the px which was to be supplied to ects .
although we have some evidence that suggest that the initial eta daesan of 11/12 under the charterparty may not have been realistic , we still do not have all the facts as to why the vessel was delayed in the preceding port in yantai , china .
there is no need to quantify the claim for the arrest papers under singapore and english law . , but can only assume that the same is true under malaysian law ( which for most part follow english law ) .
however , kuantan is apparently a notoriously difficult place to arrest a vessel because the judge is not usually accomodating and not well versed in admiralty law .

it alleges violations of the puc , unfair and deceptive practices , false advertising and fraudulent concealment against acn energy et .
in essence , plaintiffs allege in rojoin that they were offered electricity at 3.4 cents per kwh when in fact the true charges to plaintiffs turned out to be about 15 cents per kwh .
one of the allegations is that plaintiffs were not told of the " sneaky way that the fees are recalculated .
in short , the rojoin complaint as written does not really address the wholesale market other than to allege that acn is acting to take advantage of the " deregulated " electricity market .
bottom line - given the unique fact pattern of the rojoin case and subject to your confirmation that ees does not have a similar fact pattern , it may make sense to just let the rojoin case alone and not attempt to influence counsel for the defense with respect to removal and focus our efforts on the berg , continental forge and phillip cases .

" in recession , face brutal facts , thrive " by jim collins
his question drove home the fact that we have n't faced a severe , protracted economic setback for nearly 2 decades , leaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times .
that lesson is the " stockdale paradox , " a peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge from tough times not just intact , but stronger .
tortured many times during his 8-year imprisonment , stockdale lived without any prisoner 's rights , no set release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his family .
he shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war against his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda .
at one point , he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razor , deliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as an example of a " well - treated prisoner .
you can understand , then , my anticipation at the prospect of spending part of an afternoon with stockdale , who happened to be at the hoover institute across the street from my office when i taught at stanford .
if it feels depressing for me , how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and did not know the end of the story ?
i did n't say anything for many minutes , and we continued the slow walk toward the faculty club , stockdale limping and arc - swinging his leg , still stiff from repeated torture .
many analysts thought fannie mae , which was getting 9 % on its mortgage portfolio but paying 15 % on the debt it issued , was doomed .
yes , they confronted the brutal fact that the interest - rate problem was not going to magically disappear ( certainly not by christmas ) .
instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuring , fannie mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questions .
when asked how he dealt with the nay sayers and the analysts who wrote fannie mae off , maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company .
instead of using this recession as an opportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culture of discipline , the will simply restructure , lay off a bunch of people and liquidate their cultural equity .

departure follows e - biz leader 's problems enron ex - president / ceo jeffrey skilling internetweek , 08/20/01 uk :
( c ) 2001 cmp media llc enron president and ceo jeffrey skilling resigned last week , just eight months after assuming the mantle of chief executive .
in a conference call , skilling said he stepped down voluntarily , for unspecified personal reasons .
on monday enron said its 1,875 megawatt teesside power station had restarted as planned on sunday after being shut following a fatal explosion on august 8 and was " expected to be operating at planned levels again by the middle of this week " .
( bloomberg ) -- aes corp. , a u.s.-based power generator , offered to give its 51 percent stake in an indian power distributor to employees of that utility to unload the unprofitable contract .
central electricity supply co. , 49 percent - owned by the government of the eastern state of orissa , is owed $ 85 million because of power thefts and unpaid bills .
at least five foreign - run power companies face payment problems or have withdrawn investments from india citing delays , bureaucracy and the slow pace of reforms .
that violated its contract with the orissa government , which directed the company to return the money using its electricity revenue .
about half the power carried by the state - run gridco , which transmits power to four distributors including cesco , in 1998 was stolen or lost , said a government report .
two of its senior officers were put in jail after they alleged consumers had tampered with the meters .
india 's state electricity boards that distribute power lost $ 5.5 billion in the year ended march , mainly due to rising electricity thefts and subsidies , the government estimated .

only one sector is down from what we expected and that 's broadband , " enron president and chief executive jeff skilling told investors .
- enron corp. 's top executive tuesday publicly fired off the same vulgarity that brought president george w. bush embarrassing headlines when he unwittingly uttered it in front of an open microphone last fall .
bush made headlines on the campaign trail last year when he remarked to vice president dick cheney that a new york times reporter was a " major - league asshole , " not knowing that a microphone had picked up his remark .
skilling , whose candor frequently gives his public relations staff fits , told reuters in a telephone interview that he knew the microphone was on .
he disputed enron 's assertion the balance sheets and cash flow statements were not ready yet , particularly in light of skilling 's mention during the call that enron reconciles its credit risks and trading book daily .
i 'm sort of at a loss as to why that was such an objectionable question , " grubman said , adding : " he 's got some nerve .
meanwhile , dynegy , a major power generator in california , said it was being " unfairly and inaccurately " accused of withholding power from the state 's power market .
dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson attributed the increase to cold weather demands in northern states , not the california power shortage .
in a statement following the release of the earnings , president and chief operating officer steve bergstrom defended the company , saying it had been " unfairly and inaccurately accused of withholding power from the california market .
then , by the third quarter of 2000 , portland general nearly tripled its revenue from selling excess power on the wholesale market .
pacific gas and southern california edison were n't allowed to fully pass on the high power costs to customers because , under deregulation , they agreed to assume the risk of fluctuating power prices .
for the first two years of this arrangement , wholesale prices were so low that the utilities collected billions of dollars extra that they used to pay down old debts .
the staggering electricity price increases have pushed the state 's largest utility , pacific gas and electric ( pcg ) , into bankruptcy and left no . 2
the higher prices have left california utilities more than $ 14 billion in debt because regulators wo n't let them pass on all the cost of power purchases on to consumers .

thursday , february 1 , 2001 | bill to rescue utilities with rate hikes stalls in assembly crisis : plan that would have authorized state to issue $ 10 billion in bonds to buy electricity is rejected by republicans as a " bailout " after the measure barely passes the senate .
gov. gray davis -- who had repeatedly vowed to avoid using rate hikes to resolve the energy mess -- defended the bill as " essential " and said wednesday afternoon that he would sign it if it passed .
wednesday 's debate was marked by rising criticism of davis from legislators , who have accused him of responding sluggishly to the deepening energy crisis .
before davis ' letter , lawmakers had griped that they did n't know where the governor stood on the bill : " i will not vote for it unless ownership is declared by the governor , " said sen. don perata ( d - alameda ) .
no , " senate leader john burton ( d - san francisco ) said before his house approved the measure with the minimum 27 yes votes required .
and assemblywoman charlene zettel ( r - poway ) said the debate on the bill resembled what she had heard about the legislature 's action on energy deregulation four years ago , before she was elected .
it seems to me that back then we made a lot of assumptions , and we were wrong , " zettel said .
clarence brown , a spokesman for edison , denounced as " outrageous " the claims by consumer activists that the utility and its parent company , edison international , have profited from california 's ill - starred deregulation plan .
it 's not fair and it 's not right , " argued battin , who , like all but three republican colleagues , voted against the bill or abstained .
no more talking about leadership , " said campbell , the assembly republican leader .
on the democratic side , perata began circulating a " manifesto " demanding that davis take swift actions , including establishment of a state power authority that would take ownership of power plants " in or out of the state .
calling the energy crisis a " condition of extreme peril to the safety " of californians , it asks davis to prepare a plan to protect residential and small business consumers against " unjust and unreasonable " rates and immediately convene a meeting of utility creditors to review bankruptcy options facing edison and
using radio and television ads centered on the theme " flex your power , " the campaign will urge residents to shift their energy use to periods of the day when demand is low .
as the senate prepared to approve the long - term buying bill , a protest outside the governor 's office led to the arrest of two demonstrators accused of obstructing the doorway .
more than a dozen consumer activists yelled " shame , shame , shame " and waved dollar bills as they protested what they called a taxpayer - financed bailout of utilities .
these are multibillion - dollar companies that have the ability to bail themselves out without our help , " said medea benjamin , a former green party u.s. senate candidate and one of the protesters arrested .
rather than developing an effective energy policy , bush accused gore of raising gasoline taxes , discouraging domestic production of oil and natural gas , and failing to anticipate the oil and natural - gas price spikes that have occurred this year .

toward this end , bush believes that federal restructuring legislation is needed to " assure the reliability of the nation 's electrical grid , and to promote consumer choice by removing federal barriers to competition .

when i asked him about the issues re massey , he said he remembers talking to massey , but he did n't discuss buying 3/4 " coal from massey ; mcquade said that his focus was on selling the 3/4 " synfuel output and that matt arnold must have had the discussions with massey re buying 3/4 " coal .
massey had an internal memo saying that mcquade referenced a need for a 3/4 " top size because of sempra 's plr , but mcquade said steadfastly that he knew nothing about the plr , never discussed 3/4 " in the context of coal ( as opposed to synfuel ) , and said that matt must have had those discussions .
i kept reminding mcquade during breaks to answer and shut up , and he kept acknowledging that that was what he would do .
once we resumed the depo , however , he kept falling back into his habit of saying too much .
the massey stuff is not a big issue in the case , and i started fearing that mcquade 's testimony would make it one -- e.g. , they read in the massey depo , read parts of mcquade and then say that mcquade lied about it .
mcquade had one other big screw - up : after testifying all morning that there is no standard distribution within 2x0 coal , mcquade said near the end of the day that he told someone in enron in november that 2x0 has 30 - 35 % 2x3/4 coal .
he said that , after seeing again the internal massey memo ( written by a guy mcquade knows and trusts ) saying that mcquade referenced a plr and a 3/4 " top size , he began to believe that he must have said that to the massey guy .
i then asked what he meant when he gave the 30 - 35 % testimony ; he said that that was the upper limit , and that it was by no means a standard .
siegel then tried to question mcquade again about the massey meeting , but he did nothing but screw up the record .

california has gotten itself in a pickle partially because they have always looked at the market wrong - as california alone when it is really the west .
when you get the market definition wrong it is almost impossible to make head or tails of any situation - which the cal iso and gray davis 's office have in fact failed to do .
it only acts as a form of price discrimination against the california generators , who will then presumably sue for restraint of interstate commerce .

mr. bush will meet briefly on tuesday with gov. gray davis , who will insist , as he did again today , that the federal government impose price caps on wholesale electric power .
we think that 's a mistake , ' ' vice president dick cheney said on friday , talking about why he rejected those options when he prepared the energy policy the administration made public 10 days ago .
to press the case , he has hired two political operatives from the clinton white house , marc d. fabiani and chris lehane , who are being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month to make the case for price caps .
in an unusual twist in their quarrel over unpaid bills , enron corp. 's indian power project , dabhol power corp. , has rejected a check valued at $ 29.1 million from its only customer , the maharashtra state electricity board , to make a legal point .
dabhol also delivered a sharply worded four - page letter to the mseb , responding to the electricity board 's decision last week to rescind its power - purchasing contract based on a claim that dabhol misrepresented its " ramp - up " speed -- the time the plant takes to go from a cold start to full power .
india needs electricity badly , but many of its state electricity boards are cash - strapped due to widespread power theft and lax metering .
among other things , dabhol says mseb draws only about 15 % of the plant 's capacity , down from an average 60 % or so before the dispute ; the reduced usage boosts the per - unit price because the pricing formula includes some capital costs .
in its letter , dabhol says it rejected the 1.369-billion - rupee check because it came with a note saying it was submitted " under protest , " a reference to the mseb 's decision last week to rescind the contract .
either it 's rescinding the contract , or " it is affirming the validity of the [ contract ] " by making payments .
houston 's el paso corp. the california public utilities commission has accused el paso of using its power in the natural gas market to drive up gas prices in california .
at issue is whether el paso , the nation 's largest gas pipeline company , violated federal law by purposely withholding capacity on the biggest gas pipeline serving southern california during a crucial period when gas demand was on the rise last year .
as they wait in darkened elevators and struggle to pay soaring utility bills , californians discern a pattern , argues bruce cain , director of the institute of governmental studies at the university of california at berkeley .
gov. gray davis and other democratic leaders have repeatedly blamed " out - of - state " energy firms for the state 's energy woes .
the california public utilities commission cried foul and asked the federal energy regulatory commission to force el paso merchant to " disgorge " its profits earned under the contract .
after a 90-minute meeting between officials from the state and central governments , maharashtra state electricity board and dabhol executives , an enron spokesperson said he would n't comment on newspaper reports tuesday that dabhol power chief operating officer k. wade cline had told domestic lenders the company is ready to cut power tariffs by 10 % .
power tariffs , deemed " unaffordable " by the state government , are at the core of this simmering dispute .
new delhi , may 29 ( bloomberg ) -- enron corp.-promoted dabhol power company has rejected the government - run maharashtra state electricity board 's legal notice terminating their power purchase agreement , business standard reported , citing managing director k. wade cline 's written reply .
in the reply , enron said ` ` the legal notice is not acceptable to us , as according to the ppa ( power purchase agreement ) , the mseb does not have the right to rescind the agreement , ' ' the paper reported .
dabhol is owed 3 billion rupees ( $ 63.9 million ) for power supplied in december and january .
discussions are ongoing and we 'll meet again . ' ' on dabhol 's plans to cut power tariffs by 10 percent : ` ` no proposals were submitted before the committee . ' '
participants at the meeting , which lasted an hour , discussed the issue of a reduction in tariff rates charged by enron 's unit for the power it sells to indian state utility the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , government and company officials said .
but no proposals were submitted , " k. wade kline , chief operating officer , enron india pvt ltd , told reporters .
dabhol issued a notice this month to cancel its power purchase deal over this issue and said the cost of power will drop when the second phase is completed and the plant switches over to a cheaper natural gas fuel .
the meeting was attended by key executives of dabhol , the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) and representatives of the federal and state governments .
investments include stakes in listed companies calpine corp , mirant , aixtron , enron corp , ballard power systems , capstone turbine corp and gamesa .
the indian federal government has refused a proposal by the maharashtra state government that it purchase electricity from the enron - promoted dabhol power company , which is currently embroiled in a legal battle with the state .
how can central utilities buy power from dpc and sell it elsewhere when it is not possible for the maharashtra government to buy it , " the federal power minister , suresh prabhu , told pti in an interview .
stating that he had made his stand clear to the maharashtra chief minister , vilasrao deshmukh , when he came with the proposal to meet him and the finance minister , yashwant sinha , prabhu said " what appears a solution can prove to be a precursor to a problem later .
in the wake of the ongoing fight between dpc and the maharashtra state electricity board over the payment issue and legalities of power purchase agreement , deshmukh had asked the federal government to bail out the state by instructing the ntpc and the power trading corporation ( ptc ) to buy power from the second phase of dpc , to be commissioned later this year .
prabhu said states were the users of the electricity and not the federal government , which was only playing the role of a facilitator by generating and supplying power .
in a separate report tuesday , the financial express newspaper said the indian government had rejected a proposal by the maharashtra government that national thermal power corp. or power trading corp. be asked to buy and distribute power from dabhol power .
the report quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the consequences of commercial decisions taken by the state government or the mseb wo n't be passed on to consumers across the country .
dabhol power co rejects state board 's legal notice 05/29/2001
asia pulse pte ltd. mumbai , may 29 asia pulse - enron 's dabhol power company ( dpc ) has rejected the maharashtra state electricity board 's ( mseb ) legal notice for " rescinding " the ppa , saying " it did not have the right to do so , " as the two partners get ready to plead their case before the state electricity regulatory commission ( merc ) tomorrow .
in a three - page response to the mseb 's may 24 legal notice , enron india managing director k wade cline has said " the legal notice is not acceptable to us , as according to the ppa , mseb does not have the right to rescind the agreement , " the state government sources told pti here today .
geb has decided to issue bonds worth rs 650 crore to two of the three independent power projects in the state , gujarat powergen eenergy corporation and gujarat industries power company limited against their old debts .
infact , two of the three ipps , gpec and essar power had brought in pressure on the state government to settle down the past dues .
outstanding had become such a serious issue , that at one point of time , essar power , in its wisdom , had also considered dragging the state government to the court .
dabhol issued a notice this month to cancel its power purchase deal .
the ultimate beneficiary would be enron which would continue to keep a contract executed so blatantly against public interest .
the party was spoilt by a statement by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , criticising the re- negotiating committee chairman , mr madhav godbole .
but it can not be forgotten that it was mr pawar as chief minister of maharashtra , who had bypassed a lot of objections to give the project to enron .
now it has become convenient for the maharashtra government to say that the state is suffering because of the decisions of the bjp - shiv sena government .
while the role of the bjp - shiv sena government in reopening and permitting phase ii and integration of the lng terminal , by which means enron can recover the capital costs many times over , is utterly deplorable , it can not be lost sight of that it was mr pawar 's government that brought in enron .
as mr praful patel rightly said in star news ' newshour , the project had the blessings also of the then prime minister , mr p. v. narasimha rao , and his finance minister , dr manmohan singh .
to this day , neither the congress nor the bjp - shiv sena nor the ncp governments has had the courage to speak the truth -perhaps because all of them were beneficiaries .
it was this deferment of results which was taken advantage of and the letters / agreements were executed and/or exchanged during this period .
by reason of clause 2 of ppa , the status of the ppa was that of an agreement not enforceable by law until all conditions precedents had been fully satisfied and/or bona fide waived as provided in the ppa itself .
in the purported refutation also enclosed in the letter dated 18.8.1995 of the first defendant , it is stated that $ 20 million included " engineering , financing , legal , travel and administrative costs actually totalling a sum in excess of $ 20 million as of 29.3.1995 . " )
under the ppa about 25 per cent of this difference and deemed consumption and actual consumption is allowed to be retained by dpc , contrary to the tariff notification .
this is evident by the maharashtra government turning to the centre and its representative a. v. gokak , and stating that the centre is evaluating various options including of the power trading corporation to buy the power from dpc and distribute it to all the states .
french power plays have become a charged issue in italy and spain .
one of those is electricidade de portugal ( edp ) , 30 per cent owned by the portuguese government .
the other is germany 's third - largest producer , energie baden wuerttemberg ( enbw ) , 34.5 per cent owned by the french monopoly
edf. spain is acting under a new " edf law " intended to keep state - owned foreign groups from controlling its utilities .
france is liberalising its electricity market more slowly than many other eu countries , permitting only the minimum outside competition allowed under eu rules .
commissioner for energy loyola de palacio , who happens to be spanish , has argued fiercely there is no point in privatising state companies only to have them re - nationalised by someone else 's government .
it is , ` why ca n't i turn on my lights ? ' and , ` why are my electric rates so high ? '
having lost all but one statewide elected position in their increasingly democratic state , they have been eager to get a high- profile republican there to rally the troops .
she was referring to recent attacks by davis and other democrats against houston - based reliant energy and enron corp. , which have supplied energy to california .
when administration officials suggested that state officials solve their own problems , democrats responded that the message from washington was " bush to california : drop dead .
and the administration has adamantly rejected davis ' pleas to have the federal government cap the price of wholesale electricity in the state .
white house officials say price caps distort the market and would not solve the major problem facing california , which they argue is not generating enough electricity to meet demand .
white house spokesman ari fleischer disputed california democrats ' contention that the president has ignored the crisis .
recently , the state 's democratic attorney general bill lockyer sharpened his attacks on enron 's top executive , ken lay .
according to a wall street journal article tuesday , lockyer said , " i would love to personally escort lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he would share with a tattooed dude who says , ` hi , my name is spike , honey . '
enron spokeswoman karen denne responded that lockyer 's comments do " not even dignify a response .

lockyer , who is investigating possible manipulation of wholesale electricity prices by energy firms trading in california , told the wall street journal , " i would love to personally escort [ enron corp. chairman kenneth ]
lay to an 8 [ -by- ] 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says , ' hi , my name is spike , honey . '
and gary ackerman , executive director of a generators ' and marketers ' trade group called the western power trading forum , said state controller kathleen connell rang him up to apologize for lockyer .
when doris allen -- the orange county republican who was briefly the state 's first woman assembly speaker -- was driven out by fellow republicans for cutting a deal with democrats to get the job , she characterized her enemies as " power - mongering men with small penises .
yet when hannah - beth jackson , the assembly democrat representing parts of ventura and santa barbara counties , went to her santa barbara dry cleaners , she found that she was being charged $ 1.25 each for her husband 's shirts , and $ 3 each for her blouses of comparable fabric and style .
some of his party 's leaders rail against popular culture , but dana rohrabacher , the republican congressman from huntington beach , has been a fearless practitioner .
he hung out with van halen singer sammy hagar , and took up surfing ( though he passed on a challenge by surfer sally alexander , his 82-year - old democratic opponent , to a " surf - off " in 1996 ) .
now he 's bucking anti - hollywood rhetoric by enlisting one star the gop dotes on , so much so that his name was bruited about as governor material : arnold schwarzenegger .
rohrabacher met the actor through an ex - bodybuilder turned chiropractor who treated rohrabacher 's bad back , back when it was .

the marker reads " president of the united states william jefferson clinton played golf at rancho park golf course august 12 , 2000 , " and beneath it the names of three officials , one of whom was in the first foursome -- l.a. mayor richard riordan .
former clinton white house aide ben austin , now deputy mayor to riordan , says that in spite of reports to the contrary , " presidents do n't cheat at golf .
presidents ' opponents cheat for them , " a statement bolstered by former president george bush , who marveled after he left the white house ,
the thrilla on capitol hill - a nancy pelosi , the san francisco democrat , has spent some recent time of her 14 years in congress angling to get california back into the house leadership , with herself as majority whip , the person who keeps party members in line and counts noses before big votes .

after learning that his campaign used an imitation of molina 's voice and name to dis his mayoral primary opponent antonio villaraigosa , rep. xavier becerra said in a long press release that he had telephoned both villaraigosa and molina and " offered an apology on behalf of my campaign .

davis plans to press his case for caps on wholesale electricity prices , something bush insists would worsen the state 's power crisis .
bush wants to show californians that he cares about their plight , and he plans to highlight his administration 's efforts to promote conservation .
the bush - davis meeting , to be held sometime tuesday in los angeles , will certainly address the state 's electricity turmoil , and it comes amid an escalating war between democrats and republicans over national energy policy .
a field poll released last week showed only 42 % of registered voters in california approve of the job he 's doing as governor , while 49 % disapprove -- a sharp drop from january , when 60 % supported davis ' performance .
sragow assumes that advisors to davis and bush are debating among themselves over whether it serves their interests best to emerge from the talks appearing to be allies , or adversaries .
he is the president of all of the people of the united states .
but white house officials say the president 's travel agenda during his first four months in office has been designed around legislative geography : he spent most of his time on the road visiting states where senators might be persuaded to support his tax cut .
when president clinton came to california , the white house rarely if ever deigned to inform republican gov. pete wilson .
the combative wilson repeatedly sued the federal government on issues ranging from voter registration requirements to demands for reimbursements for costs associated with illegal immigration .
and if the president continues to refuse to impose price caps ?
the big question for the white house is : will they tailor their agenda to conform to california , or conclude that california does n't fit into the national mainstream as they see it ? "
on friday , democrats began running radio ads in five gop lawmakers ' districts in five states , assailing them and the administration for not doing more to bring down energy prices .
because of its democratic tilt , california was never going to be on the administration 's " a list " for federal goodies , said one washington lobbyist who works on california issues .
others , however , insist that the white house will not take actions designed only to punish california , no matter how estranged bush and davis become .
ultimately , the safety net for the state is the republican delegation in congress , " said marshall wittmann , a senior fellow at the conservative hudson institute .
in fact , davis may have more to gain by aligning himself with another washington figure whose influence expanded dramatically last week when sen. james m. jeffords of vermont quit the republican party , tipping control of the senate to the democrats .
president bush is visiting a state that has become ground zero in a democratic - republican battle for public opinion over energy . ; ; photographer :
this option had a dual purpose : provide cash to the near - bankrupt utilities to pay off creditors and get the system working again , and wrestle back jurisdiction over the wholesale electricity market from intransigent federal regulators .
that means that when the lights go out and wholesale prices skyrocket , it is not necessarily because of a physical shortage of electricity but because of an artificially induced financial shortage .
in hindsight , it is clear that davis ' worst mistake was not seizing the plants of the merchant generators who were ripping off california months ago .
adding insult to injury , davis is now using taxpayer money on several high - priced " spin doctors " and the democratic party is using millions on a media campaign to redirect the public 's anger toward the bush administration and the republicans .
let 's give the public credit : it understands that it takes two politicians and two political parties to do the blackout tango .

between one - third and one - half of that figure is offset by profits from power plants the utilities still own , but the net losses are substantial and mounting .
ratings agency standard & poor 's warned wednesday that both utilities face imminent default and a downgrading of their debt ratings to junk - bond status unless california officials acted immediately to raise rates and restore the utilities to liquidity .
if davis succeeds - he is insisting on an independent audit of the holding companies and all subsidiaries - shareholders can expect to see their dividends cut .
the utilities have cut costs at the plants , so instead of making just 6 % return on capital , the utilities have been getting a net gain of 30 % on nuclear revenues , according to bob finkelstein of the utilities reform network .
electricity traders and regulators wonder why the utilities keep buying so much power at the last minute through the independent system operator , which will pay almost anything to keep the lights on .
instead , the california puc ordered audits of utility records and scheduled hearings for next week , needed to provide a legal basis for eliminating a rate freeze that has protected most consumers from spiraling wholesale power costs .
soaring power costs in supply - short california have produced a political crisis in the state , which four years ago led the nation in deregulating its power industry .
between one - third and one - half of that figure is offset by profits from power plants the utilities still own in the state , but the net losses are substantial and mounting .
earlier this week ratings agency standard & poor 's warned that both utilities face imminent default and a downgrading of their debt ratings to junk - bond status unless california officials acted immediately to raise rates and restore the utilities to liquidity .
he expects s&p to downgrade edison 's utility debt by " a notch or two to keep politicians honest , " but stop short of giving the companies junk bond ratings .
jones)- two consumer advocate groups thursday objected to a california public utilities commission order suggesting it will decide jan. 4 to increase retail electricity rates for customers of the state 's two largest investor - owned utilities .
- based the utility reform network said such statements indicate the puc is " kowtowing to wall street " rather than protecting ratepayers .
michael shames , spokesman for san diego - bas notion that rate increases are inevitable , which is n't a position anyone in the consumer movement takes , " shames said .
the most disturbing part is this notion that rate increases are inevitable , " said michael shames , spokesman for san diego - based utility consumers action network .
it is clearly a sham procedural course that indicates the puc has something in mind to do , but they need to claim they had a public process before doing it , " said bob finkelstein , spokesman for the utility reform network .
unlike the almost daily threats of rolling blackouts from the electricity industry in california , the possibility of natural gas interruptions is unlikely even though reserves are historically low , said a company executive of
reserves of natural gas stored in four underground rock formations scattered throughout southern california are at lower levels than what socal gas normally maintains , said anne smith , vice president of customer service and marketing at socal gas , in a phone interview with dow jones newswires .
a growing economy starved for electricity to run its internet systems or manufacturing businesses , have contributed to the reasons why gas prices have soared this month , she said .
but others have temporarily been shut down because environmental laws prohibit them from emitting certain levels of pollutants annually .
jones)- independent generators selling power into california face " extremely serious counterparty credit concerns , " but the threat to their financial positions from a default by one of the state 's utilities is mitigated by their positions in other power markets , standard & poor 's said thursday .
edison - have lost a combined $ 8 billion buying wholesale power at prices far higher than they are allowed to charge their customers .
s&p said thursday that both companies face imminent default unless california officials immediately come up with a way to correct the imbalance between their buying and selling price for power , and said it would likely downgrade the utilities ' debt ratings to junk - bond status even if they avoid bankruptcy .
inevitably they are going to continue to owe money because of the constant shortfall they pay in ( electricity costs ) and what they charge their customers , " the attorney said .
but this year , prices for wholesale electricity and natural gas have skyrocketed , forcing utilities to incur costs of more than $ 8 billion that they can not pass to consumers because rates are frozen until 2002 .
john bryson , chief executive of edison international , the parent company of southern california edison , has taken the unusual step of warning consumers in television and newspaper advertisements in southern california and in sacramento that blackouts are inevitable unless order is imposed .
but not all the commissioners believed that today 's announcement would be enough to placate financial analysts and investors , many of whom buy utility stocks because they are perceived to be less risky than , for example , internet stocks .

claiming " undercollections " totaling over $ 5 billion between them , the utilities say they want the price freeze lifted and retail rates increased .

secretary of state colin powell called the attacks " an act of war " and president bush confirmed in an evening televised address to the nation that he would " make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them " .

the labour court of cologne recently ruled that an employee gives reason for a termination for cause if he threatens the employer that he will go on sick leave even though he is not ill .
the court therefore held that the employee 's behaviour was clearly an attempt to " punish " the employer and that it therefore would justify a termination for cause .
under german law , an employee who is on long - term sick leave must accept a constructive dismissal , even if this implies a reduction of his or her salary .
therefore , the employer gave constructive dismissal to him and assigned him a new job as warehouseman , where the employee was paid less salary then before .
even though the employee is given special rights by such a decision , such as extended vacation claims and special termination protection , the employer must not contest the decision if it feels it was wrong .

california may be struggling to keep its lights on , but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing .
for instance , mr. lockyer 's office has gone to san francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against reliant , houston - based dynegy inc. , and southern co. and mirant corp. , both of atlanta , after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential .
california public utilities commission and the state attorney general investigation : whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices .
fed up with its main customer 's refusal to pay its bills , the enron corporation 's indian power - generating venture served formal notice on saturday that it would terminate its power supply contract and pull out .
the move by the dabhol power company , 65 percent owned by enron , starts the clock ticking on a six - month notice period before the contract is voided , during which negotiations to settle the dispute are expected .
dabhol said it was left with little choice but to issue the termination notice after both governments failed to honor their contractual commitments to buy and pay for its output .
labeling consultants mark fabiani and chris lehane as " cut - throat , " senate gop leader jim brulte of rancho cucamonga and assembly republican leader dave cox of fair oaks said in a letter to davis that the hiring " undermines the assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis .
" " the republicans , " lehane added , " ought to be spending time writing letters to george w. bush to get him to stop the texas generators from gouging california . . . .
marc rich gains control of swiss firm marc rich , the former u.s. fugitive given a controversial pardon by president clinton , effectively pulled off a management coup at swiss real - estate company feldschloesschen - huerlimann holding by thwarting its merger plans with swiss prime site and forcing the board to quit .
mr. rich himself is not on the board , but he controls more than 10 % of the votes in feldschloesschen .
the company said the move is not related to a filing by its 65%-owned dabhol power co. to india 's maharashtra state 's electricity board to stop supplying power because it 's owed about $ 63.9 million by the board .
now it ( electricity ) can not be at any cost , " v.p. baligar , chairman and managing director of the karnataka state power transmission corp ltd ( kptcl ) , the state 's monopoly power distributor , told reuters in an interview late on monday .
the $ 2.9-billion project , which is 90-percent complete , was first billed as a showcase of india 's decade - old reform programme but now is regarded by critics as a symbol of policy bungling .
one generating firm , jindal tractabel , which uses coal and gas , gets about 2.60 rupees .
a top government official told reuters in delhi on monday the federal government is optimistic houston - based enron and the maharashtra state will resolve their wrangle .
it is sad really that enron had to issue its pre - termination notice .
interruptions are commonplace in rural areas ( sometimes up to four times a week ) .
we should call a stop to such commissions as not even 10 per cent of their purpose is served ; they too entail huge establishments which are maintained year after year at taxpayer expense .
even in asset - formation , indians ( even pakistanis ) are leagues ahead of the other immigrants .
it leaves several players mseb , successive maharashtra governments , the kirit parikh re - negotiation exercise , the central electricity authority , and other players in new delhi with no clothes on .
but this was patently fraudulent , because the comparison was based on wrong numbers , incorrect technical parameters and unequal assumptions ( one rupee - dollar rate for the dabhol tariff , another for calculating the government formula ) , all of it designed to establish what was not true .
asked in court why there had been no competitive bidding , the answer ( believe it or not ) was that mseb was not competent to handle competitive bidding .
the cea agrees to this untenable proposition , but later issues a vaguely worded clearance on the basis of a meeting whose minutes were not made available to the godbole committee .
what the report shows is that the dabhol contract can be subjected to legal test ( as in fact two members of the godbole committee recommend ) , on the grounds that it was improperly handled and violative of law and common sense .

us court denies enron , mapp utils appeals against ferc jun. 20 , 2001
jones)- a united states appeals court has rejected bids from several central u.s. utilities and power marketer enron corp. ( ene ) to change a series of refunds previously ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission .
many mapp companies , including alliant energy corp. ( lnt ) and nebraska public power district , argued to the u.s. district court of appeals in washington d.c. that ferc 's order violated rules against retroactive rulemaking .
in an opinion filed tuesday by circuit judge karen lecraft henderson , ferc 's original rulings were backed and both appeals were rejected .

u.s. energy secretary bill richardson said wednesday he would force power generators to sell electricity to california to prevent rolling blackouts .
about a dozen suppliers were demanding cash before selling power to california due to concerns about the utilities ' solvency , said kellan fluckiger , chief operating officer of the independent system operator , keeper of the state 's electrical grid .
he said officials may have to interrupt power to about a million customers wednesday afternoon and then increase the blackouts to cover three million or four million in late afternoon and early evening , when people come home from work and power demand hits a peak .
steve hansen , a spokesman for southern california edison , whose territory includes metropolitan los angeles but not the city , said the utility had not ordered blackouts by early afternoon .
in that case , the state fended off the threat of rolling outages by turning off two power - sucking water pumps on the delta .
a stage one alert was declared wednesday morning , meaning power reserves were below 7 percent and all power users are asked to conserve .
stage one and stage two emergencies , in which power reserves fall below 5 percent , have become routine this month , but last thursday 's stage three was the only time the threat of blackouts loomed .

asian officials are backing away from deregulating their electricity industries after bungled reforms in california caused power blackouts and pushed the state 's two biggest utilities to the brink of bankruptcy .
pg&e and edison piled up debt because california 's 1996 electricity deregulation law set no limits on the price they pay for power , but capped the rates they can bill consumers .
power outages in california show the power pooling system has n't benefited customers , said fuad jaafar , chief executive of tenaga , which is two - thirds government owned and the biggest southeast asian power utility by sales .
20 australia is the only country in asia which has split up and deregulated its power industry , and is one of only four places in the world which chose to use the ` ` pool ' ' price - setting mechanism , invented in the u.k. , which has failed in california .
all the others -- california , the u.k. , and alberta province in canada -- are abandoning the system because it gives electricity generators too much power to manipulate prices to boost their profits , said booth .
some parts of the world , such as scandinavia and several northeastern u.s. states , have succeeded in deregulation by allowing generators and their customers to agree power sale contracts outside the pool , said booth .

calif officials tell ferc to face ' political reality ' 11/09/2000 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2000 , dow jones & company ,
( dow jones)--the political uproar generated by the federal energy regulatory commission 's decision that it had no legal authority to order refunds in california 's high - flying power market washed up on the agency 's doorstep thursday .
california 's governor and other government leaders banded together to criticize ferc at a public meeting thursday , one week after ferc issued an order proposing market reforms for california .
other state officials , in a give - and - take that at times bordered on acrimony , insisted ferc was wrong in interpreting the federal power act as limiting the commission 's authority to order refunds .
state sen. debra bowen , who chairs the utility committee , called for ferc to recognize the " political reality " within the state of its decision not to order refunds or to firmly regulate prices until the power crisis is abated .
congress never repealed ferc 's mandate under the power act to assure that prices are just and reasonable , said state sen. steve peace , who warned that the commission 's " credibility " was at stake in not ordering refunds .
san diego board of supervisors chairman diane jacob accused the state 's unregulated power providers of " white collar crime .
peace predicted that unless ferc takes stronger action , california voters will pass a ballot initiative to condemn the state 's electricity system and make it government owned .
this is going to end up in a lawsuit no matter what you do , " peace said , urging the commission to be sued by power providers , rather than state consumers .
plenty of people are not being chased away who will build supply , " said michael kahn , chairman of the california electricity oversight board .
what 's not being addressed is pricing , " said loretta lynch , president of the california public utility commission .
the session threatened to become acrimonious as peace repeatedly directed verbal jabs at ferc commissioner curtis hebert jr. , the lone republican among the four sitting commissioners and an ardent opponent of price controls and market intervention .
there are people in this room who did , " he said , alluding to peace .

a counterclaim is my claim against somebody who has asserted a claim against me .
a cross - claim is my claim against a third party who has not asserted a claim against me .
therefore , should i so choose , i already have the ability to assert a refund claim against any of the entities that sold to me -- whether the seller has made a claim against me ( making my refund claim a counterclaim ) or has not made a claim against me ( making my refund claim a cross - claim ) .
but given my opposition to any refunds in this case , i would prefer to refrain from asserting my own refund claims ( whether counterclaims or cross - claims ) , while reserving my right to do so in the future should the need arise .
should n't the order simply exclude ripple claims as beyond the scope of the proceeding ?

many residents are directing their anger at the legislature , which in their view deregulated the market for electrical power solely at the behest of the montana power co. , once the state 's dominant utility .
under deregulation that took effect three years ago , montana power sold its hydroelectric and coal - fired generating plants to ppl corp. , the allentown , pa. , company that sells power in 42 states and in canada , great britain and latin america .
the company owned most of the state 's daily newspapers until 1959 and wielded tremendous influence among elected officials .
montana power , which had become the state 's regulated utility , outlived its creator .
few montana lawmakers understood what was happening , said ken toole , a democratic state senator and an opponent of the deregulation .
debate took place in a compressed period of time and it was not brought before the public .
jack haffey , its president and chief operating officer , said , " it was not a bill pulled out of somebody 's pocket and foisted on the public .
still , montana power emerged with marketable power plants and its thriving touch america business .
competition among power suppliers was pushing down the price of electricity .

the former president bush made it clear that he is now enjoying his retirement and avoids making public statements regarding political policy .
former president bush recalled the gulf war and how one of the key issues during that time was ensuring energy supply from saudi arabia .
just as former president bush faced a predominantly democratic congress that often thwarted his policy measures , the current president bush continues to buck heads with democrats in washington who are crafting their own energy plan .

- may 11 , 2000 massachusetts power plants agree to significant upgrades massachusetts this week announced that its six highest - polluting power plants will voluntarily upgrade their pollution control technology to not only significantly reduce air pollution but to also put the old facilities under the same standards as new facilities .
the state approached the six plants and asked them to either reduce their emissions or face regulatory action by the department of environmental protection .
cellucci said , " we challenged these power plants to clean up their act , and they have answered our call to meet the most comprehensive air emissions standards in the united states .
the massachusetts situation " does undercut the arguments of dirtier , midwestern companies that claim it ca n't be done , " said frank o'donnell , with clean air trust .
though northeastern states blame the midwest for pollution migrating in their air , hemlepp explained that since there are no serious problems with non - attainment with caa regulation in the midwest , stricter controls on utilities operating in that part of the country are unnecessary .
states like massachusetts have every right to go in and ask utilities within their state to upgrade .
and about epa 's lawsuit , " what people overlook is that epa 's lawsuit is not about emissions , it 's about what is and is n't legal under the clean air act .

industry insiders believe that an order from the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) to mandate a new board is imminent and cite the actions by the iso during the energy crisis and in the months that have followed as reason for ferc commissioners to act promptly .
a bombshell was released last week by rep. doug ose ( r - ca ) in a letter to ferc accusing the iso and the california department of water resources ( dwr ) of acting in tandem to such an extent that their dealings appear to be in collusion and prohibitive of actual independence .
attached to the ose letter was a confidential memo from energy advisor eric woychik to then iso board governor mike florio .
ose states in his letter to ferc that the memo " clearly illustrates the perils of a lack of independence " from an iso .
ferc chairman pat wood tells electric power alert that the commission " currently has a motion before us to address " the independence of the iso .
they rejected two of their proposed boards because they said they were n't independent enough .
florio , who is now with the consumer organization the utility reform network ( turn ) , claims that the iso is more independent than previous boards and has local oversight .
he goes on to state that , having served on the iso board and the previous stakeholder board , he is in a position to " say unequivocally that the current board gives iso management much more free rein than the old board ever did . "
according to the energy consultant , californians " have an ace up our sleeves " to force independence on the iso board if ferc does not act swiftly .
a ferc insider confirms that there have been commission level " discussions about the cal - iso for some time , " and that they have fielded a number of complaints against the iso for alleged lack of independence .
the sunshine notice that reveals the agenda items for discussion will not be released until dec. 12 , but insiders believe that the political pressures on ferc , the fact that they have recently been issuing orders to the iso , and the woods ' acknowledgement that it is an item before ferc indicate that they are going to be discussing the item , if not acting on it , at the next meeting .

there is no way to know what is " the truth " about this because there is no way we can step outside our own personal and cultural history and context .
someone has said that a fundamentalist is an evangelical christian who is angry about something .
you also have to keep in mind that ordinary people simply did not read the bible until about 500 years ago .
a positive one is that it made real what the protestant reformation was all about - the priesthood of believers or , as marcus borg calls it , the democratization of christianity .
think of it : prior to the invention of the printing press no one had seen such a thing as a bible .
but once all the books were selected ( which is another story ! ) and bound into one volume , it was easy to think of the bible as a single book - not the library that it is - and that this book had a single author , god .
if one takes a billable hours approach to life , every hour is just like every other .
i asked a jewish rabbi ( a redundancy ) once on the television show i did years ago if the jews were still expecting the messiah .
jesus spoke this parable to the religious leaders of the day and was trying to arouse them to the fact that their day of destiny as the people of god was upon them - right now .
spiritual language is full of symbols like that , symbols that convey a truth that is greater than literal truth .
symbols are what make truth vivid .
for example , one abiding truth , one of our continuing experiences is the tendency we have to deny our humanity and attempt to be god to ourselves .
this sin is such a central issue in the living of our lives that you can never really say all there is to say about it .
if we turn our backs on this sometimes hard , brutal , grim world as it is , we turn our backs on the only source for knowing god we ever have had or every will have .
the heart of spiritual truth is about the reality that god is right here , right now .
i 'm not asking you to believe that jesus is going to come knocking on your door tonight or that he is going to come back and walk the streets as a human being as he did before .
supposing our everyday lives were suddenly crossed by his ?
the story of adam and eve and cain and able ? and all the rest ? describes something that continues to happen to all of us all the time .
we are to be faithful in god 's absence because god is never absent .
there is still that standard of love and justice all around us ?
one meaning of the word " wait " in the bible draws the picture of being stretched taut , of being pulled .
it is in waiting like this that the very reality of faith is unfolded because faith implies a certain not having , a certain not knowing , a certain being without .
it is in this kind of waiting where being religious is so dangerous and being spiritual is so essential .

what is the basis of a legislative committee 's subpoena power ?
( b ) is addressed to the witness [ presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought]. ( c ) requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and ( d ) is signed by the president of the senate , speaker of the assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired .
contempt power : if the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or " neglects or refuses ... to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books , papers or document sin his possession or under his control , he has committed a contempt .
mr. mclain again appeared before the committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point , an affidavit was filed in superior court stating : " that , based upon evidence in its possession , the said senate interim committee has determined that each of the books , papers , and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said senate interim committee , and the production of such books , papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no . 162 . " and " that each of the books , papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said senate interim committee and that the production of such books , papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no . 162 .
the court of appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because " a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful can not be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for .
in cases of constructive contempt , as is this , not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense .
on commentator noted the following with respect to c.c.p. 1987.3 : " the rule limiting subpoenas to california " residents " ( c.c.p. 1989 ) does not apply to a subpoena duces tecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required .
code 1560 ( delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk ) ...
the recognition that out - of - state documents are not subject to the court 's process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that , absent a statute properly conferring broader powers , the extent of a state 's subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders .
therefore , if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an out - of - state officer of enron , enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under c.c.p. 1989 .
however , if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records ( or someone similarly situated ) who is employed by an enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in california , that enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents .
the question is : if the legislative subpoena was treated as a " deposition subpoena , " would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat enron as a " party " or as a " non - party " ?
there are three types of " deposition subpoena " : a " testimony only subpoena " ( requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness ) , a " business records subpoena " ( requires only the production of business records ) and a " records and testimony subpoena " ( requires both -- also formerly called subpoena duces tecum ) .
c.c.p. 2020(d ) requires that the subpoena be directed to the records " custodian " ( or someone authorized to certify the records ) .
that procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party , not merely in his or her custody .

however , ferc issued its own order in early december that mainly focused on mechanisms to keep power generators active in the state and did not adequately address the core issues of high wholesale prices and rate freezes .
harvey rosenfield , a long - time critic of the state 's utilities who led the failed attempt to overturn deregulation in california in 1998 , remains very vocal that " the people of california should not have to pay one more penny to bail out the utilities for the mistakes they made .
if mistakes were made in that legislation , consumer groups say , the utilities and not utility customers should be made to pay the price .
this has given an enormous amount of market power to the generators and allowed them to charge rates that are not reflective of their own costs .
in an ironic twist , the same companies that have expressed concern about selling power to pgoand sce actually own and control the plants that were divested by the two utilities as part of their agreements in the state 's restructuring plan .
thus , companies outside of ( and inside ) california that own california plants are refusing to sell power back into the state , power produced at plants that were once owned by pgoand sce .

business executives are being tapped for record amounts of money to support political campaigns and are tired of what one calls the " shakedown " by candidates and their parties , according to two studies released wednesday .
the study reveals that 75 percent of corporate heads feel pressure to give ; half said they fear repercussions if they turn down requests for money ; and , consequently , 60 percent support a ban on soft money .
and the two presidential candidates who made a soft - money ban central to their campaigns -- sen. john mccain , r - ariz . , and former sen. bill bradley , d - n.j. -- lost their primary election bids .
but the poll shows most people see it as a shakedown , " said freeman , who is currently a trustee of the committee for economic development , a pro - business public policy institute that favors campaign finance overhaul and is supported by officials at hasbro , genesco , pp&l inc. and other companies .
he said the ballooning of campaign contributions is backed by a recent federal court order that found the fec limits on issue - ad spending were applicable if the advertisement blatantly promoted one candidate and included the term " vote for ...
" but makinson said only 3 percent of television ads fall into that narrowly defined category .

the houston stadium is particularly valuable because of its rodeo ties and the likelihood it will host multiple super bowls , said jeff knapple , president and chief executive officer of envision , a los angeles - based consulting company .

how texas firm outfoxed state , pg&e kevin fagan , bernadette tansey , chronicle staff writers ?
the university of colorado law school graduate has mastered both the legal side of his " litigious " industry , as he once called it , and its hardball economic strategies -- skills he honed by surfing the bust - boom cycles of his business at its epicenter , texas .
attorneys generally do n't have a lot of common sense in my mind , but bill - - he 's got extra , " said former el paso mayor larry francis .
wise , though , understands the street - level complexities of the business , and what he had the company do was partly smart and partly logic .
they say they never charged more than what industry rules allowed , and that attempts to prove otherwise are preposterous .
and thus far , except for a mild rebuke here and there on technicalities , the free - market - minded federal energy regulatory commission has not concluded the company did anything wrong -- though a commission hearing is set for tomorrow on the latest allegations filed by pg&e , edison and the puc .
whatever the reason , the bottom line is that gas prices in california have been anywhere from two to 10 times as expensive as on the other side of the border in arizona , and in almost every other state .
the rise also propelled electricity costs skyward , because three out of every five electricity plants in california run on natural gas .
the firms that own those plants then jacked up electricity prices to the utilities , like pg&e , which had shed many of their own plants as part of deregulation .
and though the executives grimly waved off reporters ' questions as they strode from the room , company spokeswoman norma dunn stayed behind to insist that the accusations will blow over , " because there 's nothing to them .
accusations that el paso caused price spikes by maneuvering to hold pipeline space hostage amount to " nothing but conspiracy theories , " she said .
the exorbitant prices can not be defined away by regulators and bureaucrats , or explained away by corporate lawyers ' wordplay .
wise , when he addresses the accusations , says he is mystified why state lawmakers are mad .
when it comes to california , " el paso has always tried to be a part of the solution , not the problem , " he told a gas industry newsletter in december .
morris found that as he filed complaint after complaint against the company , the federal energy regulatory commission would either rule against the puc or put the filings off so long that they were moot when they came up .
the assembly subcommittee 's report was scathing in regard to the commission , saying its approval of el paso pipeline contracts " raises serious questions about whether it met its statutory duty under the federal natural gas act to protect consumers from unjust and unreasonable rates .
so when you 're trying to cut costs , what better to cut than something you do n't need ? said dan thomas , pg&e 's director of gas transmission .
it 's outrageous , and there was n't a thing anybody could do to stop them .
everything bad that 's happening right now ( in the pipeline fight ) could have been prevented if pg&e just had n't gotten rid of that contract back then , " wu said .
