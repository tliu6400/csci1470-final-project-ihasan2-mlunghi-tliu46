a spokesman for [P_01] co , the operator of [P_03] complete 2,184 mw power plant south of bombay , told reuters it was [P_08] not to comment on administrative and personnel matters .
the project is mired in controversy after [P_02] board ( mseb ) reneged on its commitment to buy all the power produced by the giant plant , saying it is too costly .
officials of [P_00] board ( mseb ) , in a presentation made before [P_05] electricity regulatory commission ( merc ) , today refuted [P_09] that the board underutilised its own capacity to [P_012] power purchase from enron 's [P_014] company .
no pressure from indian federal govt on [P_02] : mseb 05/09/2001
[P_00] pte ltd. new delhi , may 9 [P_03] - [P_04] board ( mseb ) has said that there is no pressure from the [P_09] on the [P_011] to continue [P_012] with us energy giant enron - promoted [P_015] company ( dpc ) .
mseb had delayed the monthly payments of [P_02] from october last year and subsequently defaulted [P_05] , [P_06] the cost of power produced [P_08] was [P_09] .
it also slapped two penalty bills of around rs 800 crore on enron for [P_04] to generate electricity within the stipulated time period of three hours .
enron subsequently has invoked state guarantees , counter - guarantees and political force majeure , and then went on to [P_06] arbitration clause .

[P_00] board has stated to [P_02] electricity regulatory commission ( merc ) that mseb 's plans to generate more power from its idle uran plant in order to avoid expensive [P_011] , are unlikely to materialise due to the high costs involved .
in a hearing that took place on tuesday , against a petition [P_04] sr paranjpe , mseb officials made it clear to the commission that it has to pay rs 16,000 per tonne for furnace oil to rashtriya chemicals & fertilisers ( rcf ) which makes the power costlier from uran .
the petition had challenged that mseb had [P_02] the merit order despatch and purchased more power from enron [P_06] limits set by merc in its may 5 order .
it is our corporate [P_01] to comment on personnel and administrative matters , " he said .

enron corp. ( ene ) , maintains the [P_02] n't [P_03] enough in asserting [P_05] over interstate power markets .
congress in the [P_01] act left retail [P_02] regulation to the states , while giving the [P_06] commission , the ferc 's predecessor , authority to regulate electricity in interstate commerce .
the ferc 's open - access transmission mandate interpreted the 1992 energy policy act , which [P_05] spur competition in [P_07] markets .
but those wholesale transmission services " bundled " with [P_03] service were left within state ratemaking authority by the ferc .
however , the ferc [P_01] state - regulated wholesale transmission in the event states opened their retail power markets to competition , effectively " unbundling " the wholesale transmission component of the formerly bundled transaction .
utilities are reserving more transmission capacity than needed to serve their retail customers as a means [P_05] competitive entry at wholesale , enron and other competitive power providers argue .
the ferc 's " determination that it lacks [P_02] the majority of interstate transmission uses has created [P_06] and unacceptable regulatory gap over the interstate transmission that a utility [P_010] is used to serve retail customers , " the electric power supply association , which represents competitive [P_016] , told the court .

to protect [P_00] and the environment , epa administrator carol m. browner today announced that [P_05] administration will require reductions , for the first time ever , of harmful [P_010] from coal - fired power plants -- the largest source of such emissions in america .
" mercury from power plants settles over waterways , polluting [P_03] and lakes , and contaminating fish .
the greatest source of [P_01] is power plants , and they have never been required to control these emissions before now .
under the [P_00] act , epa is required to study toxic [P_04] from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect [P_010] .
that study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined , mercury posed the greatest concern to [P_05] .
today , epa is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated , because mercury poses the greatest hazards to [P_09] .
the [P_00] already has taken a number [P_02] actions to reduce mercury [P_04] , including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors , medical [P_09] incinerators and [P_010] combustors .
the president highlighted the benefits of adopting a combined strategy to address all of the major pollutants emitted [P_06] plants , including mercury , sulfur dioxide , [P_09] .
the unequivocal ruling by leon county circuit judge terry lewis rejecting the plea by [P_04] affirming that florida secretary [P_06] katherine harris did indeed exercise her discretion in rejecting the hand recounts totals represents a stunning setback for vice president al gore .

but as the legal options dwindle , and the [P_03] public opinion becomes even more important , the lewis ruling and the inevitable harris certification ( barring intercession by florida 's [P_010] ) tomorrow provides [P_012] with a powerful public relations weapon to turn public opinion sharply in favor of calling the race over .

during the first three months of this year -- one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis -- an assortment [P_07] and private entities [P_09] state prices averaging well above some of those paid to texas firms , according [P_014] released to the times on monday by the department of water resources , which now [P_020] for california .
among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices [P_03] - hour were a canadian [P_06] , a subsidiary of san diego gas & electric 's parent company , and [P_011] of water and power , the report shows .
in fact , some of the biggest private power companies [P_03] for [P_04] davis and other state officials -- dynegy inc. , duke energy and mirant -- charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period .
the figures cover the various types of spot and longer - term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor - thin reserves , leading to continuous [P_012] .
just because there are other entities who [P_02] us more [ [P_04] - hour ] does n't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from houston , tulsa , atlanta or charlotte .
for example , houston - based enron , one of the nation 's biggest power traders , charged an average of $ 181 [P_07] - hour .
and atlanta - based mirant , which sold the most to the state , a total of $ 706 million , [P_07] an average of $ 225 [P_09] - hour .

best , jeff [P_01] calif complaint vs el paso
an administrative law judge has [P_01] u.s. federal energy regulatory commission dismiss a complaint alleging
el paso pipeline and el paso merchant had the ability to exercise market power , the record in this case is n't at all clear that [P_08] fact exercised market power , " [P_011] , ferc 's [P_013] administrative [P_013] , concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late tuesday .
the [P_00] , [P_02] the complaint against el paso , said later tuesday that it would appeal wagner 's decision on [P_08] .
but while that market share gave el paso the " ability to exercise market power , " wagner said , " it is not at [P_08] from the record in the proceeding that el paso merchant and el paso pipeline exercised market power .
wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that el paso [P_03] ferc rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another .
wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to william wise , el paso 's [P_04] , from the head of el paso merchant as contributing to his conclusion that el paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates " were in clear [P_013] " of ferc 's affiliate - [P_016] rules .

before christmas as written by a lawyer ' twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual yuletide celebration , and throughout our place of residence , kinetic activity was not in [P_011] among the possessors of this potential ( party of the first part ) , including that species of domestic rodent known as mus musculus .

however , he said energy providers are being unfairly targeted by accusations of [P_04] .

as the clock ticks , rifts remain in calif. electricity refund talks [P_04] , laura goldberg staff 07/07/2001
washington - california gov. gray davis vowed friday not to back down on his demands electric [P_05] cough up $ 8.9 billion for overcharging the state for electricity in the midst of a [P_011] .
but with a monday deadline fast approaching and [P_02] still confrontational , the two sides still sounded far from a negotiated settlement .
in a report filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission friday titled " myths debunked : the real story of [P_07] costs in california , " reliant assailed the " disingenuous attempts . . . to paint the picture that independent generators have been principal beneficiaries of the increase in [P_017] costs in california .
joe bob perkins , president of reliant energy 's wholesale group , argued in an interview that the higher [P_06] in [P_07] not caused [P_08] trying to push up their operating margins .
gary [P_00] , [P_01] of the western power [P_03] , a [P_04] power buyers and sellers in the western states , argued that " if the state of california insists on its fictitious number of $ 8.9 billion , that wo n't help the negotiations any , " he said .
summary : about $ 15 billion in refund [P_02] for electricity overcharges is at issue at a settlement conference ordered by ferc optimistic that he can meet a looming deadline , a judge on friday pushed to keep a surge of momentum going in talks to settle as much as $ 15 billion in refund claims for electricity [P_019] across the west .
wagner said he dropped the [P_01] after it served its [P_03] to avoid jeopardizing a deal before monday , when the clock runs out on the 15-day settlement conference ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission .
[P_00] washington are among the parties at the meeting , which is aimed at discharging financial and legal [P_06] spawned by california 's [P_08] fiasco and the [P_09] exported .
[P_00] such as reliant energy , mirant , dynegy , enron and duke energy dismiss [P_05] and counter that they have n't been paid for billions of dollars worth of electricity sales into california .
caught in a complicated middle ground are such northwest utilities as portland general electric , pacificorp , puget sound energy , avista utilities , [P_08] , plus the bonneville power administration and many [P_011] - [P_012] .
there are so many parties in it , it 's hard to keep them all in [P_05] , " the judge said , explaining that some parties were represented in both offers .
that 's [P_00] considered putting out his own preliminary refund plan .

b.c. hydro or one of the other scalpers [P_02] sell power .
but they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars [P_03] financed by [P_05] power companies are attacking davis .
davis ' ads convey the same information as a series of state- financed " flex your power " [P_06] run by the department of [P_08] , only those [P_09] do n't mention davis .
davis ' campaign fund , worth well above $ 25 million , [P_04] for the $ 150,000-per - week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions .
south dismissed the notion that [P_01] came in response to the tv [P_04] that make davis a target , [P_07] governor 's poll numbers are actually going up .
he said people [P_01] at the [P_02] attacking the governor as ridiculous , particularly one showing davis in red square .
one of the reasons we chose this ( ' energy update ' ) tack , " [P_05] , " is that people simply are not in the mood to have some full- out firefight and some [P_012] battle about this problem .
stutzman said [P_00] n't disagree with south about the ill - timed and [P_04] nature of the tv ads , which are financed out [P_08] , d.c. , but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own .
these ads , even though the the first iteration of them sound like [P_04] , very much are political ads , " stutzman said .
last month , a conservative group with links [P_02] and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming [P_06] the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from " grayouts .
time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the [P_04] attacking davis , who has accused texas firms such as reliant energy of " unconscionable price - [P_010] .
scott reed , a [P_01] for bob [P_03] 's [P_03] 1996 presidential bid , formed the [P_06] alliance in washington to raise money for the 30-second [P_09] .
but the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change [P_04] .
davis recently hired [P_01] clinton - gore campaign [P_02] house strategists [P_04] and [P_05] , and davis ' public presence and political pull dramatically increased .

mike peterson , who many of you have met and who is working with j.c. on your case , asked me to send the following e - mail to you : the lawyers for amalgamated bank [P_012] amended [P_013] complaint yesterday .
based on our initial comparison of the amended complaint versus the original one ( our comparison was " line by line " but not " word for word " ) , it appears that the only change was to add four specific requests for relief at the very end of the complaint - namely , " to order an accounting of insider - trading proceeds , " " disgorgement of insider - trading proceeds , " " restitution of investors ' monies of which they were defrauded , " and " as to the section 11 [P_020] , awarding rescission or a rescissionary measure of damages .
the amended complaint does not appear to contain any revision of the factual [P_04] or [P_05] causes of action .

that offense will prosper against an [P_02] 4.5 [P_04] rush to northern iowa in [P_06] game this season .
the cyclones have historically been horrible defending the run and [P_03] 4.4 ypr last season despite having two defensive lineman that were taken in the 3rd and 7th round of the nfl draft last spring .
while the bobcats ' offense figures to flourish , the defense is good enough to contain a cyclones ' [P_06] that tallied just 337 total [P_08] northern [P_09] .
do n't be fooled by the 45 points that [P_03] put on the scoreboard in that game as northern iowa turned the ball over 7 times , leading to short drives of [P_011] , 13 [P_012] 15 [P_013] .
ohio returns 8 starters to a defense that [P_02] just 19 points [P_04] last year and held [P_06] to 25 points and minnesota to 17 points in two road games against good [P_011] teams from major conferences .

maryland has [P_00] only 3.0 [P_01] pass play in their two games against bad [P_05] teams and i calculate that they would have allowed 3.9 [P_08] pass play if they played at that same level against a pair of averaging throwing teams .
maryland has averaged 4.8 [P_01] rushing play ( not including sacks ) in their first two games while averaging 5.1 [P_07] pass play ( including sacks ) with quarterback shaun hill in the game .
the wake forest defense should be up to the task of defending that offense as they have performed very well thus far , allowing only 3.8 [P_08] play and 5.9 [P_010] pass play .
in this game , the heels are once again up against one of the top teams in the [P_06] i suspect that they will lose the turnover battle again since [P_010] has [P_011] a turnover this season .
[P_00] 's defense has only 4 returning starters but they are once again dominating on that side of the ball , allowing only 1.8 [P_08] rush and 6.0 [P_010] pass .
buffalo 's offense is also bad , but connecticut is a horrible defensive team that has allowed 568 total [P_06] game , including 530 [P_08] to eastern washington .
tulsa blanked a horrible indiana state offense and allowed just 69 total [P_04] in doing so , but their [P_06] still questionable [P_07] run and only average in the secondary .
the veteran hurricane secondary is a positive match - up for them here against a fresno offense that gets 67 % of their [P_07] through the air , but my ratings still forecast 31 points for the dogs in this game .
fresno has yielded just 2.3 ypr this season and [P_03] heisman candidate ken simonton in their win over [P_06] .
in 3 [P_00] average overall opposition ( fresno state , [P_03] and san jose state ) , the buffs are averaging 215 [P_08] at 4.6 ypr , 246 pass [P_010] at 7.3 [P_011] and are allowing just 295 total [P_014] game at 3.5 ypr and 4.8 [P_016] .
colorado should have an easy time scoring against a jayhawks ' [P_03] ucla to run for 285 [P_06] at 4.8 ypr and [P_08] for 183 [P_09] at 9.6 [P_010] .
kansas is worse than average running the ball [P_02] it while [P_04] solid against the run and among the best in the nation at [P_08] pass .
while smu would have lost both games without the offense allowing those touchdowns , they are not as bad as [P_06] and should only be an 11 ? point underdog in this game based on my ratings .
however , i think nc state 's offense is overrated as they averaged just 3.3 [P_05] rush and 7.1 [P_06] season against a schedule of teams that combined to allow an average of 3.9 ypr and 7.5 [P_013] on defense .
the key to covering the spread in this game is for smu to score a couple of times against an nc state defense that is good [P_08] both the run and the pass .

the drug [P_00] trial " -- independent policy forum transcript now

this " ratchet effect " is of special concern in the aftermath of the sept. 11th [P_05] , as congress gave the [P_07] broad powers intended to fight [P_09] and prop up a faltering economy , according to higgs in an interview with reason magazine .

yet when testifying to congress about the proposed calea , the fbi 's then - director louis freeh [P_06] calea would confer no new authority on law enforcement officials , provide no information about the physical location of cellular phone calls , and not weaken existing privacy protections .
the calea episode , argues twight , demonstrates that congress is no match for crafty machinations of bureaucrats expert in masking their true intentions by hamstringing congress 's ability to understand the meaning of new legislation -- what twight calls an example of the [P_014] of " political transaction costs , " such as the cost of understanding the details of legislation .
the confluence of calea , [P_01] mandated electronic databases of personal information , carnivore , digital storm , echelon , and the like have established a web of federal surveillance [P_010] known in the united states , " [P_013] twight .
one way or another , we will soon learn that the resistance - inhibiting power of broad - based government surveillance is potentially the most liberty - endangering form [P_09] transaction - cost [P_011] confronting [P_012] -- and freedom - loving people everywhere -- in the new millennium .

further , drugs today are often more dangerous because anti - smuggling efforts [P_04] - marijuana laws have led drug dealers to supply drug users with more potent drugs .

[P_00] times , 11/01/00 usa : us ferc probe finds no calif. [P_04] by utilities .
- the federal energy regulatory commission on wednesday said in a report that california [P_04] not necessarily [P_06] for last summer 's price rises , which led to an unravelling of the state 's move to deregulate retail power markets .
at the same time , utilities elsewhere in the state hemorrhaged hundreds of millions of dollars due to a state - mandated [P_07] that required them to [P_09] at below cost .
during public hearings in san diego in september , ferc chairman james j. hoecker promised that the commission would take action and " do whatever it takes " to repair california 's electricity market , whose deregulation was set in [P_013] landmark state legislation in september 1996 .
but [P_00] of power generation companies -- which some in the state accuse of " gaming , " or [P_06] system to wield [P_08] " market power " and wringing [P_010] profits from customers -- is unlikely , according to published reports and state industry principals and government officials .
the ferc commissioners are said to [P_02] market deficiencies and defects in california for a supply - demand imbalance that sent [P_07] prices skyrocketing in july to an [P_09] 12.9 cents a [P_011] - hour , more than triple the july 1999 [P_014] 3.9 cents .
[P_00] administration has gone on record demanding that ferc , [P_03] the transmission and wholesale selling of electricity around the country , to step in and [P_09] legal [P_010] restore " just and fair " [P_013] in california .
i have no idea what the ferc will say , " [P_03] loretta lynch , a davis appointee [P_07] she is as much in suspense as anyone .
[P_00] and the state 's [P_02] would like to see ferc impose some sort [P_05] -- even gut the power exchange and the independent system operator because they are clearly not working as intended .
[P_00] groups would like to see ferc [P_02] the [P_03] collected [P_04] " [P_05] unreasonable , " legal code [P_07] would open the gates to actions by the puc or the legislature to force the [P_013] to disgorge or refund [P_015] profit .
duke and others also strenuously oppose a solution proposed by the state 's [P_04] , notably [P_05] of water and power : that the industry in essence be re - regulated by imposing a system of cost - based rate controls , similar to how electricity rates were set before deregulation .
such a move would lead to lawsuits [P_02] duke and other power merchants alleging " confiscatory " actions by the state nullifying the value [P_08] of millions of dollars they have invested in [P_011] plants .
los [P_00] general manager s. david freeman , who has led calls for temporary imposition of cost - based rates , said california 's [P_08] deregulation experiment raises the possibility that [P_010] intrinsically an " un - deregulatable " service .

by james taranto shattered the secret [P_02] who was booted from an american airlines flight on christmas day has hired a team [P_07] lawyers to press his case that he was the [P_011] " profiling .
as we noted friday , a press release from the council on american [P_04] relations [P_05] the pilot had [P_06] him out
not only because he is [P_01] - american but because he is muslim -- though how anyone was supposed to have known shatter 's [P_08] is a mystery .
presumably the folks at cair are aware that three out of four arab - [P_04] .
* * quote * * * in the report , the pilot said [P_04] began when a flight attendant said she and other flight attendants were concerned about the actions of a passenger .
while the passenger was away , the flight attendants " observed books in the individuals ( sic ) seat which were written in what she assessed was [P_09] style print , " the pilot wrote .
shatter , of course , was carrying a gun , which , as a law - enforcement agent , he was entitled to do -- but one can hardly fault the pilot for wanting to be absolutely certain the firearm - toting passenger was [P_014] he was .
airport - security bureaucracy can be maddening , and as a cop , he 's probably [P_05] to having his authority questioned .
but the point is , the airlines have a longstanding record of not messing around when it comes to access to their planes -- [P_08] what the passenger 's color is .
when [P_00] spokeswoman laura mayo says [P_02] was [P_03] profiling but about " confirming that an armed individual is [P_07] says he is and that he is qualified to travel , " we ought to believe her .
* * another times report says the terror group lashkar - i - taiba , which is believed to have [P_06] , has [P_08] blow up the taj mahal -- a muslim mausoleum .
and the press [P_01] india picks up a [P_03] report that , as pti puts it , " president [P_07] musharraf has left [P_08] in pakistan - occupied kashmir ( pok ) free to continue their activities in jammu and kashmir , confining his mild [P_015] to pakistan proper .
musharraf responded that pakistan was prepared [P_02] if it came to that : but he made unmistakably clear that [P_06] militants were [P_08] of pakistan itself .
he said , " no wicked , bigoted [P_02] will be [P_03] to derail us , and we , the vast , silent majority , must [P_08] not to be voiceless , passive onlookers to our own internal destruction .
* * [P_00] caged bird sing ? http://kausfiles.com/ speaking of optimism , here 's mickey kaus 's take on [P_06] defiance of the " 20th hijacker " :
shin bet , [P_01] 's security agency , foiled the plan when it " arrested a hamas operative at the rafah border crossing as he attempted to travel to saudi arabia to organize funding for the project .
[P_00] , osama zuhar hamed karika , " told investigators that he was instructed . . . to travel under the pretext of wishing to make a pilgrimage to mecca ; once there , he met with hamas officials and solicited financial backing .
the post also reports that an iranian newspaper is [P_03] ex - president hashemi rafsanjani 's [P_05] with nuclear weapons :
on that day , the strategy of the west will hit a [P_04] end , since a single [P_06] bomb has the power to completely [P_08] , while an israeli counterstrike can only cause partial damage to the [P_013] world , " he said .
* noruz , a reformist newspaper , criticized rafsanjani and , " [P_04] ex - president 's statements caused damage to the state 's national interests .
belarus is quietly acting as a leading supplier of [P_03] military equipment to [P_04] radicals -- with [P_05] militant organizations in the middle east , balkans and central asia often the recipients , " mark lenzi writes in a [P_013] op - ed :
* * * while it is deplorable that belarus 's weapons have been responsible for prolonging civil [P_05] and internal strife in countries such as tajikistan , angola and algeria , it is particularly [P_011] that sudan , a country where [P_013] used to live and one that is known as a haven for [P_018] , has obtained from belarus such proven and capable weapon systems as t-55 tanks and mi-24 hind helicopter gunships .
given that [P_00] has [P_01] tried to shoot down u.s. and british [P_04] patrolling the u.n. no - fly zone -- with more than 420 attempts this year alone -- covert belarusian - iraqi military cooperation is [P_012] and should set off alarm bells in western capitals .
the [P_00] quotes celinda lake , " a [P_03] pollster who is an authority on reaching [P_05] voters , " as [P_07] on terror has drawn strong support from the fairer sex :
* * quote * * * lake . . . said bush 's [P_04] message has had the unusual effect of appealing both to " women on the left who are concerned about rights and equity and traditional feminism , and to women on the right who were concerned about [P_016] 's treatment of female [P_018] missionaries .
the federal [P_00] badly shocked after sept. 11 , " he [P_04] san [P_05] .

[P_00] delayed the monthly payments of [P_02] from october last year and subsequently defaulted payments , [P_06] the cost of power produced by dpc is exorbitant .
enron india had subsequently invoked state guarantees , counter - guarantees , and [P_04] majeure and then went on to [P_07] arbitration clause .
[P_00] deshmukh has convened a crucial meeting on saturday with state officials , [P_05] board ( mseb ) , the advocate general and legal experts to take stock of the situation of the ongoing dabhol crisis .
in fact , the state energy department and mseb were surprised over the recent statement by the union [P_06] power [P_07] that neither national thermal [P_09] nor power trading corportion are in a position to purchase or trade [P_013] to other states .
the centre should benchmark " an affordable " tariff [P_03] power company 's ( dpc ) liquified natural gas ( lng ) based power , so as to enable the central utilities like the national thermal [P_012] ( ntpc ) or the power [P_015] ( ptc ) to buy and distribute power from the us [P_019] , according to a senior official [P_020] government .
now that [P_00] ready for renegotiations , [P_02] does the centre not set the terms of tariff for the multinational 's lng - based power ? , " the official said here today reacting to a statement made yesterday by union power [P_014] that the centre would allow sale of power to a " willing buyer " if dpc and [P_020] board ( mseb ) jointly approach with a concrete proposal .
the [P_00] also categorically stated that ntpc could not buy dpc 's power , as it was a mere " power selling entity " .
that is a time limit that had never been demanded before and which the dabhol equipment is [P_05] to meet .
then the central government used this time - limit issue as an [P_04] not paying enron money that was due under the project 's [P_08] .
this must have confirmed enron 's belief that there is really no chance of it ever [P_05] to settle down at dabhol to a normal business relationship with [P_09] government , the state 's [P_012] , and the [P_013] board .
then there were blockages on enron 's plans for broadband telecom and gas sales , followed by the nagpur attacks , and damming statements issued since [P_08] government .
now the story is lost in a complex array of arbitration and conciliation , lenders ' meetings , government meetings , and often contradictory [P_08] .

[P_00] people know the price of everything and the value of nothing .
certainly too few consumers and policymakers understand the value of renewable energy products - products that avoid the acid rain , [P_07] , global warming , and soot pollution caused by mainly coal - [P_011] plants .
it 's [P_00] that few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still do n't know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage .
consumer inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the [P_05] people know the price of everything .
even sophisticated observers do n't know the price of comparative products , regardless of the added environmental and [P_06] costs .
price transparency is a bad [P_01] , because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in houston .
perhaps even fewer know how prices alone , not including the stranded cost charges , of today 's competitive products compare to their utilities ' unbundled generation rates [P_09] prior to competition .
but [P_00] 's only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question about electricity : " what is it worth ?
the price for renewable generation must be over 8.0 cents / kwh for the [P_04] to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and nuclear power .
for hospitals , which must fight the devastating health effects of [P_03] coal - generated power every day , how much is that worth ?
the price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for [P_04] power in 1996 or even what many are paying now .

mr skilling simply cited " [P_01] " in his farewell conference with analysts .
and there were those who accused him of having adopted a domineering approach that turned off [P_05] dealt with the company .

[P_00] hill and [P_01] jeff skilling receiveda cream pie in the face when he went to san francisco in june to address a meeting .
in the past six months there have been accusations that enron manipulated power prices in california ; [P_05] in india over its attempt to pull out of a project near bombay ; and a halving of its share price from last year 's peak of dollars 90 .
on tuesday came the surprise announcement that mr skilling would step down [P_04] executive and president for [P_06] , to be [P_07] , enron 's [P_010] mr skilling 's predecessor [P_012] executive .
mr skilling told analysts that [P_01] to do with enron .
enron was not alone , even if it [P_02] the most aggressive in its attempt to pioneer new markets .
the enron case is slightly different , because it was mr [P_03] led the company through its strong growth phase , although mr skilling was a fundamental part of the strategy and increasingly the frontman for the company even before he took over [P_014] executive .

sources at enron would not elaborate , but insisted that skilling , 47 , did not [P_05] for health reasons .
so if the enron ship is on course , skilling is n't ill and timing really was n't an issue , [P_07] n't he either wait until december [P_09] or announce his resignation but make it effective dec. 31 and collect the extra $ 2 million ?

earlier this week , sen. joe lieberman ( d - ct ) made a thoughtful speech about the success of new democrats in reviving their party 's traditional commitment to a " foreign policy that was values - based and fully engaged , a defense policy that was muscular and modern , and an [P_018] that was internationalist .
but [P_00] made news in [P_01] to the fall conference of the new democrat network by openly saying what [P_06] have privately concluded during the last month : the [P_010] the president 's well - articulated position on the scope of [P_014] on [P_015] means that we can not necessarily limit [P_018] to afghanistan .
moreover , said lieberman , " it should make us unflinching in our [P_04] remove [P_05] from power [P_06] before he , emboldened by september 11 , strikes at us with weapons of mass destruction .
[P_00] is one of the few [P_02] from either party to publicly connect the dots between our proclaimed [P_06] any form [P_07] " with global reach , " and the obvious [P_011] a middle eastern [P_013] state that is sponsoring [P_014] , pursuing [P_015] mass destruction , continuing [P_017] its neighbors , and is dedicated to the elimination of the u.s. presence in the region -- much of it necessitated , of course , by [P_020] 's continued behavior .
the president has eloquently and [P_01] said any country that is not on our side in the [P_05] must be treated as a " hostile power .
by any measure , [P_01] is a supremely [P_02] power that shares every anti - american impulse of both [P_06] and [P_07] , while having far superior means for attacking us .
this line of [P_01] reminiscent of the reasoning behind the decision in 1991 to leave [P_05] in power in [P_06] , followed by an unsuccessful [P_08] regime and the permanent stationing of u.s. troops in the persian gulf region .
whatever you think about that decision and its consequences , it 's clear now that we can not let [P_06] concern for political stability and coalition - building keep the united [P_010] the [P_011] network and protecting our country from terrorist [P_014] that continue every day .
but especially in the case of [P_02] on the united states itself , multilateralism should not become an [P_06] .
does this mean we have to go [P_02] in [P_03] ?

at the october 29th hearing in san jose , the industrial welfare commission ( iwc ) approved an amendment of the statement as to the basis of wage order 5 , rejecting the controversial letter written by mr. miles locker , [P_013] counsel , division of [P_015] enforcement ( dlse ) , that [P_018] any deductions from exempt employee 's salary in increments of less than one - month during temporary plant [P_020] down .
however , ab 60 did [P_01] any language that specifically [P_03] wage deductions from exempt employees in increments of less than one month .
while the amendment clearly indicates where the commission stands on the issue , according to commission chair , bill dombrowski , ( amendment passed on a 4 - 1 vote ) it only applies to wage order 5 ( [P_013] ) and not to the other 14 orders .

by ian christopher mccaleb / [P_01] washington --
two highly sensitive computer hard drives that were missing from [P_03] alamos national laboratories earlier this year never left the premises , and the fbi has uncovered no hints of espionage in the case , energy secretary [P_012] told a [P_014] wednesday .
in a statement opening a lengthy and touchy hearing [P_03] committee , richardson said : " based upon the [P_07] the fbi so far , there is no [P_010] espionage , [P_012] there [P_013] drives have ever left los alamos . "
i will not take ( disciplinary ) action until i have all the facts [P_04] , " he said , vowing , " i will not rest until i know what happened -- when , where , [P_012] and by whom .
during his watch , [P_01] alamos [P_02] wen ho lee was removed from his position amid [P_05] .
members of congress have also raised [P_02] over the reported sale [P_04] once used at the savannah river nuclear weapons facility in augusta , georgia .
mr. secretary , " warner said directly to richardson , " on june 23rd of last year you told this committee , in [P_07] : ' the secretary of energy , ' and i quote you , ' ... must be accountable and must be responsible " for such security failures .
harsher still was [P_01] leveled by sen. robert byrd ( d - west virginia ) , a member of richardson 's own party , [P_08] richardson 's pledges to get to the bottom of the case would not sway the opinion of the [P_015] , whose trust he had lost permanently .
richardson , who at times looked stunned by the tone taken by many committee members , [P_05] himself -- [P_07] he wanted to have " all the facts " in hand before making a congressional appearance .
sen. james inhofe ( r - oklahoma ) suggested that the " captain of the ship " was n't richardson , but president bill clinton , who inhofe said was responsible for a variety of security policy changes and leaks to the media that have led to a relaxed , [P_016] attitude among those [P_018] overseeing the nation 's weapons secrets . '
serious loss of control over classified information ' also appearing before the panel was dr. john browne , director of [P_06] alamos facility .
he said the fallout from the security breach was " too political , " adding , " i did not utter one [P_07] word in that committee .
but sources familiar with the investigation told [P_02] on tuesday that this account has come under suspicion because of " conflicting statements " made during interviews and polygraph tests .
browne , the lab 's director , has [P_02] security rules for the tracking of items classified as secret were eased government - wide in 1992 to reduce the cost of handling the large amount of documents carrying this designation .

since 1997 by 20 % --- partnership dealings cited as dynegy talks go on ; [P_05] an issue
shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from [P_04] that the [P_06] government pay an estimated $ 1.6 billion for past power purchases .
the enron sec filing also [P_01] about [P_02] of its outside auditor , arthur andersen llp , which reviewed the company 's annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with [P_011] principals .
enron 's restatement of earnings yesterday did not [P_02] enough to allow investors to [P_05] of [P_06] on during the company 's many strange transactions with related parties .
but the restatement should , at the least , cause investors and wall street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so - called pro forma earnings , which leave out unpleasant realities and [P_011] accounting rules .
the question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while [P_05] losses of the other one .
[P_00] , the [P_01] executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies -- and whose influential friends include president bush -- is the one who points to the bleachers .
dynegy 's [P_00] , charles l. watson , is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts .
[P_00] markets around the united states were deregulated , the companies followed clearly divergent paths .
yet [P_00] most of the power plants it [P_03] and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast .
the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to [P_06] volatility , and as a result , once again is [P_09] north american gas producers . ' '
details of those charges were [P_01] , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues [P_07] of the partnership transactions . ' '
[P_00] ever have to fix [P_02] in your [P_04] when you get your monthly bank statement in the mail ?
while the transactions themselves do not appear to have been [P_03] , the way some of them were recorded in enron 's financial statements led to the corrections .
bottom of form 1 nov. 9 , [P_02] enron , dynegy still talking merger smaller energy trader 's shares up ; analysts see it poised to profit by [P_010] houston [P_011] merger discussions between dynegy and enron corp.
she also wonders [P_01] ken lay , enron 's [P_03] , is apparently willing to sell enron at such a low price .
what has hammered enron 's securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , the chief [P_010] , [P_011] finally forced to go on leave .
these partnership deals [P_01] really [P_02] , except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company [P_09] was involved .
[P_00] should investors who are n't owners of enron stock or bonds care ?
but the sec has publicly questioned the company 's prospects , the existence of its [P_05] contracts , and the identity of its managers .
so it ca n't simply [P_01] premature disclosure on someone else 's bad judgment .
two years after the [P_01] was embroiled in an [P_03] trading scandal , oversight of floor brokers is still too lax , according to [P_08] .
in 1999 , nine brokers [P_01] to [P_02] related to schemes in which [P_05] a share of trading profits .
there are broad variations across companies as to whether they are democracies or dictatorships , " said andrew metrick , a finance professor at the wharton school of business , [P_010] the study with paul gompers and joy ishii of harvard university .
typical provisions included poison pills , which allow all pro - management shareholders to buy stock at discounts during takeover attempts diluting the power of the [P_08] bidder ; super - majority votes , which require from 66 to 85 per cent approval for a management change rather than a majority ; golden parachutes , which give large compensation packages to executives who are fired or demoted ; and classified boards , whereby board members ' terms are staggered , preventing them from all being ousted at the same time .
other investors in the energy merchant have already filed law [P_03] company officials , alleging [P_05] seeking to [P_06] lost share value , estimated at $ 20bn over the last month .
hewlett - packard shareholders were also [P_02] this week .
companies [P_00] for every by - law that reduced shareholder rights .
[P_00] reserved risk arbitrageurs , the people who bet on the price and likelihood of mergers and acquisitions taking place , need nerves of bomb disposal experts .
the question of the underlying value in enron comes down to two risks : the contingent liabilities from the widely discussed off - balance - sheet vehicles that [P_09] to swap assets for financings , and the safety of the trading accounts .
chuck watson , dynegy [P_01] executive , is a friend of jeff skilling , who quit as [P_05] in august .
[P_00] reserved enron [P_01] - rivals steady the enron ship - competitors - fears over price and disruption lay behind caution .

the state enron records to stay [P_02] court los [P_03] 09/07/2001
despite energy companies ' [P_01] california is a bad place to do business , dozens of electricity generators want to cash in on low- cost state loans to build power plants .
we 'll be the wal - mart of energy , " [P_03] , who is one of four authority members [P_07] gov. gray davis .
skyrocketing natural gas prices last winter led in part to the [P_03] electricity prices that bankrupted pacific gas and electric co. and plunged the state into crisis .
freeman said dozens of energy companies , including enron and reliant , had submitted proposals [P_05] gas - fired peaker power plants .
a conservative appointee to the [P_01] a vote yesterday on banning businesses from cutting private electricity deals with generators , [P_08] wanted to give more firms time to sign up .
the [P_00] prompted by an aug. 29 dow jones [P_03] report that the iso directed edison to ramp [P_06] low - cost , 1,500-megawatt mohave generating station in nevada at [P_010] in recent months .
the report cited iso sources [P_01] motivation was to prevent the dwr [P_04] its contracted power supplies at a loss .
i am very concerned that the [P_02] , in concert or collusion with the department of water resources , is abusing its broad authority over the transmission of electrical power over interstate power lines in order to avoid political embarrassment for the davis administration , " jones wrote .
this [P_00] , because it involves the interstate transmission of electrical power , must be [P_05] your [P_06] the authority granted to you by the [P_09] act , " jones said in the letter to wood , who was unavailable for comment wednesday .
for months now , competitive power providers have been asking ferc to decide whether the iso meets the commission 's requirements for independent governance , given that [P_09] and the state is deeply involved in power markets .
those sources say they expect the commission to ultimately act on the matter , and rule that [P_05] appointed board runs afoul of ferc 's requirement for independence from market participants .
it 's completely [P_01] to say we 're in collusion with cal iso , " said dwr [P_05] hidalgo , calling jones 's [P_08] " really reaching " and without merit .
[P_00] were made during a hearing into power prices that began on wednesday in washington , d.c. , by the united states federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) .
cdwr 's statements are " inappropriate " because [P_02] overcharging in the california market is already being addressed in a separate ferc proceeding , she said .
we believe they [ [P_01] overcharges ] are a separate issue and are already being dealt with , " she said yesterday .
ms. odowichuk said that powerex was a net power importer during the period in question , and that the company believes [P_07] are unfounded .
the state of california maintains it [P_02] almost $ 9-billion in [P_04] .
in comments filed at the [P_01] earlier this week , pacific gas & electric said the rate agreement would be [P_07] because assembly bill 1x -- which put the state in the energy - purchasing business in january -- does not allow customers to be [P_015] for dwr power that is not delivered to them .
california entered the power business when a surge in [P_03] prices and a regulatory [P_05] on consumer rates created billions of dollars in losses for the [P_09] .
pg&e said one section of the draft rate agreement would require the [P_04] to order that dwr power be delivered to utility customers whenever the [P_08] requests , " even if the dwr power is millions , if not billions , of dollars more expensive than the utilities ' own power supplies or power available from third parties .
in july , the state racked up $ 46 million in losses after selling [P_04] for one - fifth the price [P_07] .
even without a rate increase , the bill has been bitterly [P_03] consumer [P_04] , who have labeled it a [P_07] have [P_08] a ballot initiative to reverse it .
at the end of the day , the people of the state of california are going to have to depend on [P_07] and the senate to stop this obscene giveaway .
california 's largest utility , pacific gas & electric co. , chose to take [P_04] bankruptcy in the spring rather than seek a government solution to its problems , and the lights did not go dark in northern california as a result .
but [P_00] other supporters of the bill argued that the state 's only way out of the [P_06] is to have the private utilities regain their financial health .
and only a surprising [P_01] assemblyman bill leonard of san bernardino [P_04] the bill to clear the assembly 's energy committee .

commissioners postponed voting on the controversial issue of suspending [P_03] choice enacted as part of the state 's deregulated power market .
we 're being negligent in [P_01] respond to this [P_03] not only to the viability of the state bond issue but to basic fairness , " wood said .
while there 's a general expectation in the market that the power bond deal will get done , it 's [P_06] , so people are keeping their eye on the developments , " blair said .

state [P_00] angelides said this week that once the rans are issued , the state will have enough money to cover [P_07] costs until the middle of next year .

the [P_00] on thursday delayed again a vote to suspend retail power choice , one of the cornerstones of the state 's 1996 electricity deregulation law .
cpuc commissioner carl wood said that despite " populist [P_03] " about retail choice in the [P_05] , big businesses demanded that the option be included so they could switch power suppliers and " avoid paying their share " of past debts incurred by the utilities .
when power shortages sent [P_01] last year , independent [P_04] " dumped their customers back on the utilities , " wood said .
the [P_00] them from passing their power costs to consumers .

presto said he 's [P_01] do it in power for anybody .
are power generators [P_01] manipulating the market to obtain higher profits and , if so , should price caps be imposed to protect ratepayers ?
whether or not individual generators are trying to manipulate is not the question and [P_04] are certainly not the answer .
in addition , one must remember that the vast majority of generation remains under regulatory and/or legislated prices -- only about 10 % [P_07] " bid " and cleared ; [P_010] the market thinness has lead to volatility .
second price auction certainly does n't help , since everybody gets paid whatever ( the one [P_05] ? ) is the highest bidder 's bid .
the other half is meaningful demand responsive behavior -- price caps will [P_04] true costs from consumers and stifle that too .
the answer to your second question , then , is that [P_03] are clearly re - regulation [P_06] - free market .
[P_00] else would generation be reduced " for economic reasons " ?
the concept of deregulation was to enhance competition through [P_03] choice of the end user , not the supplier .
this is [P_00] more than consumers ever paid for energy .
until investors , customers , and employees stand as one against utilities selling [P_04] their generation , this situation will continue to be one of simple market economics ( supply vs. demand ) .
the only winners are the [P_01] these utilities as they get rewarded for the high sale prices of the plants , while customers are exposed to higher prices and lower reliability and , sadly , employees lose jobs , pay level , and seniority that are hard , if not impossible , to replace .
if there is [P_01] prices , price caps are not the way to penalize the criminals because price caps affect every single seller , not the individual or handful of individuals who are [P_011] the market and acting against the public interest .
in high dudgeon the politicians intervene and impose a cap of x - 10 , which captures the bad actors but also unfortunately penalizes all of the other actors in the market , slam dunking them in order [P_012] the few bad actors .

so , just as we have been saying for more than four years , deregulation will only lead to unregulated monopolies , because of the physical and economic nature of the electric power itself , and because no one has the political power to enact the structural reforms needed to overcome the power of the for - profit [P_019] that still completely dominate this industry .
is anyone [P_00] , when during light [P_02] , the price of power is low and at times
hot weather and lack of surplus capacity caused the price [P_03] price caps now just prolong the pain .
the state of california 's actions in imposing [P_02] caps is a simple issue of politically motivated interference in the free market that will ultimately harm consumers .
