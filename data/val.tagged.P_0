families of executives overseeing u.s. energy giant enron corp 's [P_03] power company ( dpc ) project in india are leaving the country , possibly signalling an intention to terminate [P_010] complete $ 2.9 billion project , an india newspaper said on wednesday .

a spokesman for [P_01] co , the operator of the nearly complete 2,184 mw power plant south of bombay , told reuters it was [P_08] not to comment on administrative and personnel matters .
the project is mired in controversy after [P_02] board ( mseb ) reneged on its commitment to [P_06] the power produced by the giant plant , saying it is too costly .
officials of [P_00] board ( mseb ) , in a presentation made before [P_05] electricity regulatory commission ( merc ) , today refuted [P_09] the board underutilised its own capacity [P_011] power purchase from enron 's dabhol power company .

the petition had challenged that [P_01] the merit order despatch [P_04] more power from enron [P_06] limits set by merc in its may 5 order .

enron corp. ( ene ) , maintains the commission did n't [P_03] enough in [P_05] over interstate power markets .
congress in the [P_01] act left retail [P_02] regulation to the states , while giving the [P_06] commission , the ferc 's predecessor , authority to regulate electricity in interstate commerce .
the ferc 's open - access transmission mandate interpreted the 1992 energy policy act , which [P_05] spur competition in [P_07] markets .
however , the ferc [P_01] state - regulated wholesale transmission in the event states opened their retail power markets to competition , effectively " unbundling " the wholesale transmission component of the formerly bundled transaction .

order no . 888 , as the ferc calls its open - access rulemaking , " respects the division of federal and state authority drawn by congress in the ( [P_010] act ) , while taking into account the changes that have taken place since the act was enacted , " edison electric institute said .

to protect [P_00] and the environment , epa administrator carol m. browner today announced that [P_05] administration will require reductions , for the first time ever , of harmful [P_010] from coal - fired power plants -- the largest source of such emissions in america .
the greatest source [P_01] emissions [P_02] plants , and they have never been required to control these emissions before now .
under the [P_00] act , epa is required to study toxic [P_04] from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect [P_010] .
that study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined , mercury posed the greatest concern to [P_05] .
today , epa is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated , because mercury poses the greatest hazards to [P_09] .
[P_00] administration already has taken a number [P_02] actions to reduce mercury [P_04] , including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal [P_08] combustors , medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors .
the president highlighted the benefits of adopting a combined strategy to address all of the major pollutants emitted by power plants , including mercury , sulfur dioxide , [P_09] and [P_010] .
the unequivocal [P_00] leon county circuit judge terry lewis rejecting the plea by [P_04] affirming that florida secretary of state katherine harris [P_08] exercise her discretion in rejecting the hand recounts totals represents a stunning setback for vice president al gore .
it means the certification of the florida vote is likely to proceed on saturday , with secretary of state harris certain [P_07] bush the winner and give florida 's 25 electoral [P_010] bush and thus put him over the top with 271 electoral [P_015] .
if they are told [P_01] , then it is obviously over .
but as the legal options dwindle , and the [P_03] opinion becomes even more important , the lewis ruling and the inevitable harris certification ( barring intercession by florida 's [P_010] ) tomorrow provides the republicans with a powerful [P_014] weapon to turn public opinion sharply in favor of calling the race over .

during the first three months of this year -- one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis -- an assortment of public and private entities [P_09] state prices averaging well above some of those paid to texas firms , according [P_014] released to the times on monday by the department of water resources , which now buys power for california .
among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt - hour were a canadian [P_06] , a subsidiary of san diego gas & electric 's parent company , and [P_011] of water and power , the report shows .
in fact , some of the biggest private [P_02] for [P_04] davis and other state officials -- dynegy inc. , duke energy and mirant -- charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period .
the figures cover the various types of spot and longer - term power purchased by the [P_05] three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor - thin reserves , leading to continuous power emergencies .
just because there are other entities who [P_02] us more [ [P_04] - hour ] does n't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from houston , tulsa , atlanta or charlotte .
for example , houston - based enron , one of the nation 's biggest power traders , [P_05] an [P_06] $ 181 per megawatt - hour .
and atlanta - based mirant , which sold the most to the state , a total of $ 706 million , [P_07] an [P_07] $ 225 [P_09] - hour .
by [P_00] , a calgary , canada , firm , transalta energy , [P_04] $ 335 a megawatt - hour , and the [P_07] utility district had average [P_09] $ 330 [P_011] - hour .

the move by pgoand edison follows a summer of chaos in the california power market , where a shortage of electricity generated within the state and open market power pricing sent the cost of [P_011] to nearly twice its historical average , frequently trading above the proposed $ 100.00 cap .

as the clock ticks , rifts remain in calif. electricity refund talks [P_04] , [P_05] staff 07/07/2001
washington - california gov. gray davis vowed friday not to back down on his demands electric [P_05] cough up $ 8.9 billion for overcharging the state for electricity in the midst of a [P_011] .
but with a monday deadline fast approaching and [P_02] still confrontational , the two sides still sounded far from a negotiated settlement .
in a report filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission friday titled " myths debunked : the real story [P_06] power costs in california , " reliant assailed the " disingenuous attempts . . . to paint the picture that independent generators have been principal beneficiaries of the increase in [P_017] costs in california .
joe bob perkins , president of reliant energy 's wholesale group , argued in an interview that the higher wholesale prices in [P_07] not caused [P_08] trying to push up their operating margins .
gary ackerman , [P_01] of the [P_02] , a trade association of [P_05] buyers and sellers in the [P_07] , argued that " if the state [P_010] insists on its fictitious number of $ 8.9 billion , that wo n't help the negotiations any , " he said .
summary : about $ 15 billion in refund claims for electricity overcharges is at issue at a settlement conference ordered by ferc optimistic that he can meet a looming deadline , a judge on friday pushed to keep a surge of momentum going in talks to settle as much as $ 15 billion in refund claims for electricity [P_019] across the west .
wagner said he dropped [P_01] after it served its [P_03] to avoid jeopardizing a deal before monday , when the clock runs out on the 15-day settlement conference ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission .
oregon and washington are among the parties at the meeting , which is aimed at discharging financial and legal claims spawned by california 's power deregulation fiasco and the staggering wholesale electricity [P_010] exported .
[P_00] such [P_01] energy , mirant , dynegy , enron and duke energy dismiss [P_05] and counter that they have n't [P_08] for billions of dollars worth of electricity sales into california .
caught in a complicated middle ground are such northwest utilities as portland general electric , pacificorp , puget sound energy , avista utilities , [P_08] , plus the [P_09] administration and many consumer - [P_012] .

their fuel is free , though the power they generate is not because the machines [P_05] so expensive .
but they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars [P_03] financed by [P_05] are attacking davis .
davis ' ads convey the same information as a series of state- financed " flex your power " ads run by the department of [P_08] , only those ads do n't mention davis .
davis ' campaign fund , worth well above $ 25 million , is paying for the $ 150,000-per - week [P_06] spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions .
south dismissed the notion that [P_01] came in response to the tv [P_04] that make davis a target , [P_07] governor 's poll numbers are actually going up .
he said people [P_01] at the ads attacking the governor as [P_03] , particularly one showing davis in red square .

an independent audit finds the utility 's return was double the 15 % the agency said it made selling [P_06] the crisis .
by [P_00] and rich connell and robert j. lopez , [P_03]
the document , obtained by the times under the [P_03] records act , seems sure to reinforce [P_06] that the [P_08] company effectively helped its customers at the [P_011] those suffering blackouts and rate hikes .
for months , [P_01] officials have [P_02] questions about [P_03] by [P_04] the agency [P_05] for just 15 % above its costs .
as recently as july , [P_01] s. [P_03] , [P_04] heads davis ' new statewide power authority , [P_07] that assurance in a letter to u.s. senators probing the energy meltdown .

he [P_00] he had issued " standing orders " to [P_03] at a profit of no more than 15 % .
it was [P_00] , " [P_02] , who [P_03] he led efforts to cap [P_06] last year .
still , wiggs said , even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated , it was not [P_06] .
we [P_00] just and reasonable rates , " he said , adding that [P_04] now offers the [P_06] with no profit margin .
wiggs [P_00] audit in may as questions intensified about the role of [P_04] and [P_05] power agencies in driving up the price [P_08] periods of scarcity .
sen. fred thompson [P_01] , the ranking republican on the governmental [P_04] , which is investigating the crisis , was one of those recently assured by freeman in writing that [P_010] 's profits were limited to 15 % .
freeman [P_00] the utility 's prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly , inefficient plants .
[P_00] mayor richard riordan , a possible [P_03] challenger to davis , last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by [P_08] during his city hall tenure .
he said the mayor [P_01] questioned the agency 's pricing strategy .
yet another report -- this one by the state 's power - buying agency -- found that [P_05] and some [P_07] utilities [P_08] higher than average [P_09] the first quarter of this year .
although [P_00] his aides have tried to keep the focus on texas - based energy suppliers , [P_06] sacramento and [P_07] been broadening the debate to include the conduct of government - [P_012] .
in a letter to a senate investigating [P_02] month , he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about [P_06] and others are " merely the tip of the iceberg relating to [P_011] of in - [P_012] utility agencies .
the [P_00] that [P_01] department of water resources to buy power exempted the purchases from puc reviews designed to [P_07] from unreasonable charges .
people ought to be laying [P_01] arms over their energy agendas and asking the question :
another measure would suspend the right of businesses and other electricity customers [P_04] buying electricity from their local utility and choose their own power provider .
the company has reacted angrily to a draft puc decision to shift $ 600 million of the state 's cost of buying power from [P_08] pg&e , saying the plan was [P_010] and discriminates against pg&e customers .
wind and [P_00] , sunshine and rotting [P_02] .
in the legislature , a [P_01] debated bill would require every power seller in the state to provide increasing amounts of " green " power , rising to 20 percent of their portfolios by 2010 .
[P_00] hydroelectric power is shortsighted , and i think not considering nuclear options within the state , at least giving it some [P_07] , is shortsighted , " said karal cottrell , a sacramento municipal utility district director .
that 's actually just one of the [P_02] .
[P_00] has so much been left to the final hours ?
the first half of the year was utterly dominated by the energy situation and [P_04] a [P_05] conflict over the state budget [P_07] 's economy softened and revenues dipped sharply .
they represent , in effect , the two faces of [P_03] party -- davis the cool , business - friendly centrist and burton the passionate , labor - oriented [P_010] -- and their personal relationship is practically nil .
greg fishman , an iso spokesman , said " there are times , this does n't happen much , when because of varying [P_07] , we take a bid out of sequence , meaning when [P_012] has a bid of let 's say $ 50 a megawatt - hour
however , the iso 's federal tariff states that the agency must use the cheapest electricity available in the wholesale market before dispatching the more expensive [P_08] generators and retail customers .
the iso shall dispatch generating units ... to meet its [P_03] requirements based on order of energy bid prices , " reads a section of the rules approved by the federal energy regulatory commission .
moreover , the iso has [P_01] disclose on its web site the price of the dwr power , which is [P_07] regulations .
[P_00] - jones , executive director of the [P_03] , a trade group representing large and small power producers , said there is " [P_09] transparency in the iso market .
in fact , [P_01] in california even sold excess energy to neighboring states .
you do n't have to [ make ] [P_02] or replace equipment because of intermittent failures , " he says .
there 's no [P_01] not to have one .
meanwhile , municipal utility sellers , technically [P_02] to ferc regulatory jurisdiction under the [P_05] act , are challenging the commission 's assertion of authority to order them to make refunds .
the vast majority of those involved in the market are due refunds , but only a minority are seeking refunds , " said one attorney in the case , among a handful contacted [P_011] jones [P_012] who spoke freely on condition [P_014] be identified .
where it stops , [P_01] knows .
during the peak of the state 's [P_02] , [P_03] of [P_05] power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials previously acknowledged , it was reported monday .
at the same time , though , the dwp and [P_03] charged some of the [P_06] during the crisis , official reports later showed .
in an interview with the times last week , former [P_03] chief s. david freeman , [P_05] heads davis ' new statewide power authority , [P_08] he had issued " standing orders " to [P_012] at a profit of no more than 15 percent .
wiggs said that his staff had found no documentation as of friday to confirm the [P_05] a strict pricing policy during freeman 's tenure , but he said that even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated , it was not [P_014] .
we [P_00] just and reasonable rates , " wiggs told the times , adding that [P_05] now offers the [P_06] with no profit margin .
taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is [P_05] , " said harry snyder , senior advocate for [P_09] , the nonprofit that publishes consumer reports .
all we are doing is making sure pacificorp has sufficient power to meet its regulatory obligations , " [P_06] ian russell said monday .
the difficult thing is that when we bought that power to meet regulatory supply obligations , we were buying at a price that is over [P_08] what it is today .
merchant [P_00] in california , such as dynegy inc. ( dyn ) [P_04] corp. ( mir ) continue to sell to the iso , as ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission .
once [P_00] deregulated , the price of a [P_03] of energy will change by the minute , with prices posted on the internet [P_08] .

- the federal energy regulatory commission on wednesday said in a report that [P_04] were not necessarily to [P_06] last summer 's price rises , which led to an unravelling of the state 's move to deregulate retail power markets .
during [P_00] hearings in san diego in september , ferc [P_03] j. hoecker promised that the commission would take action and " do whatever it takes " to repair california 's electricity market , whose deregulation was set in [P_013] landmark state legislation in september 1996 .
but [P_00] of power generation companies -- which some in the state accuse of " gaming , " or [P_06] system to wield [P_08] " market power " and wringing [P_010] profits from customers -- is unlikely , according to published reports and state industry principals and government officials .
the ferc commissioners are said to blame market deficiencies and defects in california for a supply - demand imbalance that sent [P_07] prices [P_08] in july to an [P_09] 12.9 cents a [P_011] - hour , more than triple the july 1999 average of 3.9 cents .

some consumer groups would like to see ferc [P_02] the [P_03] collected [P_04] " [P_05] unreasonable , " legal code words that would open the gates to actions by the puc or the legislature to force the power companies to disgorge or refund [P_015] profit .

such a move would lead to lawsuits [P_02] duke and other power merchants alleging " confiscatory " actions by the state nullifying the value [P_08] of millions of dollars they have invested in [P_011] plants .
los [P_00] general manager s. [P_02] , who has led calls for temporary imposition of cost - based rates , said california 's [P_08] experiment raises the possibility that electricity is intrinsically an " un - deregulatable " service .

what it fails to mention is that conservative u.s. rep. bill archer , r - houston , has endorsed the plan and that the pro - arena campaign [P_09] are notable [P_010] fund - raisers ken lay and don jordan .
beyond brown , the letter also seeks to tie the pro - arena campaign to vice president al gore , [P_06] presidential candidate .

[P_00] taranto [P_01] the [P_01] service agent [P_02] booted from [P_04] airlines flight on christmas day has hired a team of washington lawyers to press his case that he was the [P_011] " profiling .
as we noted friday , a press release from the council on american [P_04] relations [P_05] the pilot had [P_06] him out
not only because he is arab - american but because he is muslim -- though how anyone was supposed to have known shatter 's [P_08] is a mystery .
presumably the folks at cair are aware [P_02] out of four arab - [P_04] christian .
* * quote * * * in the report , the pilot said [P_04] began when a flight attendant said she and other flight attendants were concerned about the actions of a passenger .
while the passenger was away , the flight attendants " observed books in the individuals ( sic ) seat which were written in what she assessed was [P_09] style print , " the pilot wrote .
shatter , of course , was carrying a gun , which , as a law - enforcement agent , he was entitled to do -- but one can hardly fault the pilot for wanting to be absolutely certain the firearm - toting passenger was [P_014] he was .
airport - security bureaucracy can be maddening , and as a cop , he 's probably [P_05] to having his authority questioned .
but the point is , the airlines have a longstanding record of not messing around when it comes to access to their planes -- no [P_08] the passenger 's color is .
when american airlines spokeswoman laura mayo says [P_02] was not about [P_04] profiling but about " confirming that an armed individual is [P_07] says he is and that he is qualified to travel , " we ought to believe her .

* * [P_00] caged bird sing ? http://kausfiles.com/ speaking of optimism , here 's mickey kaus 's take on the courtroom defiance of the " 20th hijacker " :
shin bet , [P_01] 's security agency , foiled the plan when it " arrested a hamas operative at the rafah border crossing as he attempted to travel to saudi arabia to organize funding for the project .
[P_00] , [P_01] zuhar hamed karika , " told investigators that he was instructed . . . to travel under the [P_07] of wishing to make a pilgrimage to mecca ; once there , he met with hamas officials and solicited financial backing .
the post also reports that an iranian newspaper is [P_03] ex - president hashemi rafsanjani 's [P_05] with nuclear weapons :
on that day , the strategy of the west will hit a dead end , since a single [P_06] bomb has the power to completely [P_08] , while an israeli counterstrike can only cause partial damage to the [P_013] world , " he said .
belarus is quietly acting as a leading supplier of lethal military equipment to [P_04] radicals -- with [P_05] militant organizations in the middle east , balkans and central asia often the recipients , " mark lenzi [P_012] a [P_013] op - ed :
* * * while it is deplorable that belarus 's [P_03] have been responsible for prolonging civil [P_05] and internal strife in countries such as tajikistan , angola and algeria , it is particularly [P_011] that sudan , a country where [P_013] used to live and one that [P_016] as a haven for [P_018] , has obtained from belarus such proven and capable weapon systems as t-55 tanks and mi-24 hind helicopter gunships .
given that [P_00] tried to shoot down u.s. and british [P_04] patrolling the u.n. no - fly zone -- with more than 420 attempts this year alone -- covert belarusian - iraqi military cooperation is [P_012] and should set off alarm bells in western capitals .
the [P_00] quotes celinda lake , " a democratic pollster who is an authority on reaching [P_05] voters , " as [P_07] war on terror has drawn strong support from the fairer sex :

mseb had delayed the monthly payments of [P_02] from october last year and subsequently defaulted payments , [P_06] the cost of power produced [P_08] is exorbitant .
enron india had subsequently invoked state guarantees , counter - guarantees , and political force majeure and then went on to [P_07] arbitration clause .
[P_00] has convened a crucial meeting on saturday with [P_04] , [P_05] board ( mseb ) , the advocate general and legal experts to take stock of the situation of the ongoing dabhol crisis .
in fact , the state energy department and mseb were surprised over the recent statement by the union minister of power [P_07] national thermal [P_09] power trading corportion are in a position to purchase or trade dabhol power to other states .
the centre should benchmark " an affordable " tariff of [P_03] company 's ( dpc ) liquified natural gas ( lng ) based power , so as to enable the central utilities like the national thermal [P_012] ( ntpc ) or the power trading corporation ( ptc ) to buy and distribute power from the us energy major , according to a senior official of [P_020] .
now that dpc is ready for renegotiations , [P_02] does the centre not set the terms of tariff for the multinational 's lng - based power ? , " the official said here today reacting to a statement made yesterday by union power [P_014] that the centre would allow sale of power to a " willing buyer " if dpc and [P_020] board ( mseb ) jointly approach with a concrete proposal .
the [P_00] also categorically stated that ntpc could not buy dpc 's power , as it was a mere " power selling entity " .
that is a time limit that had never been [P_03] before and which the dabhol equipment is [P_05] to meet .
then the central government used this time - limit issue as an [P_04] not paying enron money that was due under the project 's finance ministry [P_09] .
this must have confirmed enron 's belief that there is really no chance of it ever [P_05] to settle down at dabhol to a normal business relationship with [P_09] government , the state 's [P_012] , and the [P_013] board .
then there were blockages on enron 's plans for broadband telecom and gas sales , followed by the nagpur [P_06] , and damming statements issued since [P_08] government .
seemingly forgotten is the basic fact that enron 's senior [P_03] india obtained authority last month from dabhol 's board to terminate the project if matters do not improve .

[P_00] people know the price of everything and the value of nothing .
certainly too few consumers and policymakers understand the value of renewable energy products - products that avoid the acid rain , [P_07] , global warming , and soot pollution caused by mainly coal - [P_011] plants .
it 's not [P_01] few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still do n't know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage .
[P_00] inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the rule that people know the price of everything .
even sophisticated observers do n't know the price of comparative products , regardless of the added environmental [P_05] health costs .
price transparency is a bad [P_01] , because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in houston .
but [P_00] 's only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question [P_05] : " what is it worth ?
the price for renewable generation must be over 8.0 cents / kwh for the consumer to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and [P_010] .
for hospitals , which must fight the devastating health effects of [P_03] coal - generated power every day , how much is that worth ?
the price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for [P_04] power in 1996 or even what many are paying now .

after six months [P_01] executive , mr skilling [P_03] on tuesday evening , shocking financial markets , the analysts who had tracked his 11-year rise to the top - even the [P_011] hired him .
mr skilling simply cited " [P_01] " in his farewell conference with analysts .

enron is one of several energy traders facing questions in california over [P_04] prices - which it denies .
[P_00] hill and [P_01] jeff skilling receiveda cream pie in the face when he went to san francisco in june to address a meeting .
in the past six months there have been accusations that enron manipulated power prices in california ; [P_05] in india over its attempt to pull out of a project near bombay ; and a halving of its share price from last year 's peak of dollars 90 .
on tuesday came the surprise announcement that mr skilling would [P_03] executive [P_05] for [P_06] , to be [P_07] , enron 's [P_010] mr skilling 's predecessor [P_012] executive .
mr skilling told analysts that [P_01] had [P_02] do with enron .
enron was not alone , even if it [P_02] the most aggressive in its attempt to pioneer new markets .

sources at enron would not elaborate , but [P_02] skilling , 47 , did not resign for health reasons .

this is an exact replication of national public > radio(npr ) interview between a female [P_05] , > and > us army general reinwald [P_08] about to sponsor
[P_00] went [P_01] and the interview ended
earlier this week , sen. joe lieberman ( d - ct ) made a thoughtful speech about the success of new democrats in reviving their party 's traditional commitment to a " foreign policy that was values - based and fully engaged , a defense policy that was muscular and modern , and an [P_018] that was internationalist .
but lieberman made news in [P_01] to the fall conference of the new [P_04] network by openly saying what [P_06] have privately concluded during the last month : [P_010] of the president 's well - articulated position on the scope of the [P_015] means that we can not necessarily limit [P_018] to afghanistan .
moreover , said [P_01] , " it should make us unflinching in our determination to remove [P_05] from power in [P_07] before he , emboldened by september 11 , strikes at us with weapons of mass destruction .
lieberman is one of the few [P_02] from either party to publicly connect the dots between our proclaimed war on any form [P_07] " with global reach , " and the obvious [P_011] a middle eastern [P_013] state that is sponsoring [P_014] , pursuing weapons of mass destruction , continuing [P_017] its neighbors , and is dedicated to the elimination of the u.s. presence in the region -- much of it necessitated , of course , by [P_020] 's continued [P_020] .
the president has eloquently and [P_01] any country that is not on our side in [P_05] on [P_06] must be treated as a " hostile power .
by any measure , [P_01] is a supremely hostile power that shares every anti - american impulse of both [P_06] and the [P_07] , while having far superior means for attacking us .
this line of [P_01] reminiscent of the reasoning behind the decision in 1991 to leave [P_05] in power in [P_06] , followed by an unsuccessful sanctions regime and the permanent stationing of u.s. troops in the persian gulf region .
whatever you think about that decision and its consequences , it 's clear now that we can not let [P_06] concern for political stability and coalition - building keep the united states from [P_011] the [P_011] network and protecting our country from [P_014] that continue every day .
but especially in the case of [P_02] on the [P_03] itself , multilateralism should not become an [P_06] inaction .
does [P_00] we have to go [P_02] in [P_03] ?
as joe [P_00] rightly said : " our fundamental principles are at least as much on the line in this [P_06] as they were in our battles with nazism and communism during the last century .

by ian christopher mccaleb / [P_01] washington --
two highly sensitive computer hard drives that were missing from [P_03] alamos national laboratories earlier this year never left the premises , and the fbi has uncovered no hints of espionage in the case , energy secretary [P_012] told a [P_014] wednesday .
in a statement opening a lengthy and touchy hearing [P_03] armed services committee , richardson said : " based upon the [P_07] the fbi so far , there is no [P_010] espionage , [P_012] there [P_013] drives have ever left los alamos . "
i will not take ( disciplinary ) action until i have all the facts [P_04] , " he said , vowing , " i will not rest until i know what happened -- when , where , [P_012] and by whom .
during his watch , los alamos scientist wen ho lee was removed from his position amid [P_05] spying .
members of congress have also raised [P_02] over the reported sale of computers once used at the savannah river nuclear weapons facility in augusta , georgia .
harsher still was the criticism [P_01] by sen. robert byrd ( d - west virginia ) , a member of richardson 's own party , [P_08] richardson 's pledges to get to the bottom of the case would not sway the opinion of the senate , whose trust he had lost permanently .
richardson , who at times looked stunned by the tone taken by many committee members , sought [P_05] -- [P_07] he wanted to have " all the facts " in hand before making a congressional appearance .
sen. james inhofe ( r - oklahoma ) suggested that the " captain of the ship " was n't richardson , but president [P_07] , who inhofe said was responsible for a variety of security policy changes and leaks to the media that have led to a relaxed , [P_016] attitude among those [P_018] overseeing the nation 's weapons secrets .

but sources familiar with the investigation told [P_02] on tuesday that this account has come under suspicion because of " conflicting statements " made during interviews and polygraph tests .

since 1997 by 20 % --- partnership dealings cited as dynegy talks go on ; [P_05] an issue
shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the california [P_06] pay an estimated $ 1.6 billion for past power purchases .
the enron sec filing also raises questions about [P_02] of its outside auditor , arthur andersen llp , which reviewed the company 's annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with [P_011] principals .
enron 's restatement of earnings yesterday did not [P_02] enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company 's many strange transactions with related parties .
but the restatement should , at the least , cause investors and wall street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so - called pro forma earnings , which leave out unpleasant realities and [P_011] accounting rules .
the question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while [P_05] losses of the other one .
[P_00] lay , the enron [P_01] who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies -- and whose influential friends include [P_08] -- is the one who points to the bleachers .
dynegy 's chairman [P_01] executive , charles l. watson , is less well [P_04] is well respected among [P_06] .
yet [P_00] most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast .
the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to [P_06] volatility , and as a result , once again is threatening north american gas producers . ' '
details of those charges were [P_01] , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues [P_07] of the partnership transactions . ' '
` ` you buy a lot of fleas when you buy enron , ' ' said meade , [P_06] enron ` ` accumulate ' ' and owns no shares .
[P_00] ever have to fix [P_02] in your checkbook when you get your monthly bank statement in the mail ?
while the transactions themselves do not appear to have been [P_03] , the way some of them were recorded in enron 's financial statements led to the corrections .
bottom of form 1 nov. 9 , [P_02] enron , dynegy still talking merger smaller energy trader 's shares up ; analysts see it poised to profit [P_09] merger discussions between dynegy and enron corp.
she also wonders [P_01] ken lay , enron 's chairman [P_03] executive , is apparently willing to sell enron at such a low price .
they clean up the financial and economic landscape and [P_03] off disease - carrying pests .
for canadians unfamiliar with enron and its place in u.s. energy markets , here is an introduction : voltaire summed up the entire 18th- century deistic proof of the existence [P_010] by saying , " if god did not exist , it would be necessary to invent him .
had gov. gray davis and his top officials [P_02] developments in electricity futures , they would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the golden state .
what has hammered enron 's securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , [P_010] financial officer , who was finally forced to go on leave .
these partnership deals were [P_01] , except in [P_03] balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company [P_09] was involved .
[P_00] should investors who are n't owners of enron stock or bonds care ?
keeping ljm off the balance sheet [P_02] enron to avoid major swings .
but the sec has publicly questioned the company 's prospects , the [P_04] its [P_05] contracts , and the [P_06] of its managers .
the treasury apparently screwed up on two counts : not [P_03] it allow the news to leak out early through a third party ( a consultant who attended a department briefing without press credentials ) , but it also posted the information on its own web site before it was publicly announced .
so it ca n't simply [P_01] premature disclosure on someone else 's bad judgment .
two years after the [P_01] was embroiled in an [P_03] trading scandal , oversight of floor brokers is still too lax , according to [P_08] .
in 1999 , nine brokers [P_01] to [P_02] related to schemes in which [P_05] a share of trading profits .
yes , just when it seems enron has exhausted its considerable reserves of [P_04] things , the company surprises and produces yet another .
there are broad variations across companies as to whether they are democracies or dictatorships , " said andrew metrick , a finance professor at the wharton school of business , [P_010] the study with paul gompers and joy ishii of [P_013] .
typical provisions included poison pills , which allow all pro - management shareholders to buy stock at discounts during takeover attempts diluting the power of the [P_08] bidder ; super - majority [P_010] , which require from 66 to 85 per cent approval for a management change rather than a majority ; golden parachutes , which give large compensation packages to executives who are fired or demoted ; and classified boards , whereby board members ' terms are staggered , preventing them from all being [P_020] at the same time .
other investors in the energy merchant have already filed law [P_03] company officials , alleging [P_05] seeking to [P_06] lost share value , estimated at $ 20bn over the last month .
hewlett - packard shareholders were also asserting [P_02] this week .
companies [P_00] for every by - law that reduced shareholder rights .
[P_00] reserved risk arbitrageurs , the people who bet on the price and likelihood of mergers and acquisitions taking place , need nerves of bomb disposal experts .

[P_00] reserved enron [P_01] - rivals steady the enron ship - competitors - fears over price and disruption lay behind caution .
it also fired treasurer ben glisan and a division general counsel , saying it believed they had made personal investments in some of [P_07] , whose activities have led to conflict of interest accusations [P_011] against senior enron officials and board members .
bond - rating companies have sharply [P_02] enron 's bonds since these disclosures , and its debt is now one step above [P_08] , by some ratings .
that debt is to investors who purchased assets from enron , including a water system in [P_05] other holdings .
06:40 pm est url : enron ( ene : [P_03] - news - commentary ) still has n't come clean on the shadowy deals that led to many of the company 's problems .
enron [P_00] some of raptor 's hedging losses itself , but it [P_04] through a $ 711 million pretax charge , which it chose to exclude from operating earnings in the third quarter .
in october , enron replaced [P_01] financial [P_02] fastow because of his involvement in the partnerships .
the company said there [P_01] admission of liability on its part , nor [P_04] any state or federal regulations .
enron , also based in houston , owns wessex water , for which [P_04] pounds 1.4bn in 1998 , and gas - fired power stations [P_08] , including the high - performing 1900mw teesside plant .
now , in no small part because of its executives ' own highhandedness and dismissive treatment of those same investors and analysts , enron 's reputation is in tatters , the u.s. securities and exchange commission is probing billions of dollars worth of off - balance - [P_015] , its once high - flying stock has tanked , its bonds are trading at levels usually reserved for troubled [P_020] and the lawsuits are flying thick and fast .
the [P_00] they do not speak clearly for themselves without some interpretation , given the current economic conditions and the effects of merger and other one - time charges .

if , after evaluating all those factors , an annuity still appears appropriate , then as [P_05] we also urge the purchase of a low - cost annuity such as one offered by vanguard , t. rowe price , fidelity , annuitynet.com , or ( in some states )

we 'll be the wal - mart of energy , " said freeman , who is one of four authority members [P_07] gov. gray davis .
skyrocketing natural gas prices last winter led in part to the [P_03] electricity prices that bankrupted pacific gas and electric co. and plunged the state into crisis .
a conservative appointee to the [P_01] a vote yesterday on banning businesses from cutting private electricity deals with generators , [P_08] wanted to give more firms time to sign up .
the [P_00] prompted by an aug. 29 [P_02] newswires report that the iso directed edison to ramp [P_06] low - cost , 1,500-megawatt mohave generating station in nevada at various times in recent months .
the report cited iso sources saying the motivation was to prevent the dwr [P_04] its contracted power supplies at a loss .
i am very concerned that the [P_02] , in concert or collusion with the department of water resources , is abusing its broad [P_08] the transmission of electrical [P_010] interstate power lines in order to avoid political [P_013] for the davis administration , " jones wrote .
this [P_00] , because it involves the interstate transmission of electrical power , must be investigated by your [P_06] granted to you by the [P_09] act , " jones said in the letter to wood , [P_013] unavailable for comment wednesday .

california entered the power business when a surge in [P_03] prices and a regulatory [P_05] on consumer rates created billions of dollars in losses for the [P_09] .
pg&e said one section of the draft rate agreement would require the [P_04] to order that dwr power be delivered to utility customers whenever the [P_08] requests , " even if the dwr power is millions , if not billions , of dollars more expensive than the utilities ' own power supplies or power available from third parties .
even without a rate increase , the bill has been bitterly [P_03] consumer activists , who have labeled it a [P_07] have [P_08] a ballot initiative to reverse it .
at the end of the day , the people of the state of california are going to have to depend on [P_07] and the senate [P_08] this obscene giveaway .

energy central deregulation [P_01] forum question august 25 , 2000 http://www.energycentral.com
are power generators [P_01] market to obtain higher profits and , if so , should price caps be imposed to protect ratepayers ?
[P_00] that is not discussed in any of these articles is the average price of electricity over a longer period , say the entire year .
whether or not individual generators are trying to manipulate is not the question and price [P_05] certainly not the answer .
in addition , one must remember that the vast majority of generation remains under regulatory and/or legislated prices -- only about 10 % [P_07] " bid " and cleared ; no wonder the market thinness has lead to volatility .
second [P_00] certainly does n't help , since everybody gets paid whatever ( the one [P_05] ? ) is the highest bidder 's bid .
the other half is meaningful demand responsive [P_02] -- price caps will [P_04] true costs from consumers and stifle that too .
the answer to your second question , then , is that price [P_04] clearly re - regulation [P_06] - free market .
[P_00] else would generation be reduced " for [P_02] " ?
the concept of deregulation was to enhance competition through [P_03] choice of the end user , [P_05] supplier .
this is [P_00] more than consumers ever paid for energy .
until investors , customers , and employees stand as one against utilities selling [P_04] their generation , this situation will continue to be one of simple market economics ( supply vs. demand ) .
if there is [P_01] prices , price caps are not the way to penalize the criminals because price caps affect [P_07] seller , not the individual or handful of individuals who are [P_011] the market and acting against the [P_013] interest .
in high dudgeon the politicians intervene and impose a cap of x - 10 , which captures the bad actors but also unfortunately penalizes all of the other actors in the market , slam dunking them in order [P_012] the few bad actors .
what is with california and [P_01] ?
/ a are power generators [P_01] market to obtain higher profits in san diego ?
so , just as we have been saying for more than four years , deregulation will only lead to unregulated monopolies , because of the physical and economic nature of the electric power itself , and because no one has the political [P_014] enact the structural reforms needed to overcome the power of the for - profit [P_019] that still completely dominate this industry .
is anyone [P_00] , when during light load periods , the price of power is low and at times
the state of california 's actions in imposing [P_02] caps is a simple issue of politically motivated interference in the free market that will ultimately harm consumers .
