[P_00] as many as four or [P_02] an hour .
the workers and [P_01] authorities [P_02] the swings [P_03] of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market .
they and other [P_01] , including aes corp. and a partnership between nrg energy inc. and dynegy inc. , have [P_07] that [P_07] electricity demand forced them to run aging , decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet california 's needs .

a computer analysis by the [P_01] of shutdown data over a recent 39-day period shows reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns .
plants [P_00] reliant , aes , mirant corp. and duke energy inc. accounted for more than half of the state 's unplanned shutdowns , even though their generating capacity [P_010] more than 25 percent of the state 's total capacity from all sources .
reliant , one of california 's largest and most profitable out - of - [P_04] , reported 319 shutdowns during the period in march and april .
reliant 's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 megawatts over the 40-day period , an [P_06] 1,368 per day - enough power for 1.4 million homes for one hour .
[P_00] sources say reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice .
one way to obtain those high prices , the plant workers said , was the simple method of demanding a sky - high price and [P_08] deliver power if that [P_010] not met .
on one occasion , one operator said , reliant ordered a unit at etiwanda to be [P_05] off because the iso would not meet the price of $ 1,000 [P_09] hour , even though the legal price cap at the time was $ 750 .

this is n't the first time that nhtsa has failed its mission , argues michael i. krauss , [P_06] at george mason university and author of the recent [P_09] book fire and smoke : government , lawsuits and the [P_013] law .
nhtsa , the agency responsible for minimum fuel economy standards ( found by a court to have likely cost many lives by forcing manufacturers to produce light , dangerous cars ) and for [P_011] - to - disable , baby - killing airbags , does not deserve to be rewarded for its asleep - at - the - switch approach to the tire problem , " krauss wrote recently .
however , when nhtsa fails , self - proclaimed " [P_03] " call for a parallel absurdity : lavishing the agency with more regulatory authority and [P_09] funds .
in this light , perhaps what most needs to be recalled and held [P_04] sloppy workmanship and [P_06] advertising is : the defective regulatory state .

privatization and community [P_01] , by bruce benson , at medicare reform :
this omission , which has stalled any genuine reform of medicare , is [P_04] fault of economists , says economist robert b. helms in the new issue of the [P_010] .
my criticism is not directed to [P_02] who have attempted for many years to apply market principles to health - care issues , but to the larger number of economists who have not , " helms [P_012] .
moreover , my criticism pertains to the failure of economists to teach the fundamental principles [P_05] to educated [P_06] , rather than to the failure of ' economics . '
without a concerted effort to impart these principles to a wider audience , helms argues , medicare reform -- and other necessary health - policy reforms -- will become [P_09] political maneuvering , much to the detriment of the lives and well - being of the [P_015] .

this is the story of the night my ten - year - old cat , rudy , got [P_06] stuck in the [P_07] disposal .
getting him out was n't easy , though , and the process included numerous home remedies , a plumber , two cops , an emergency overnight veterinary clinic , a case of mistaken [P_011] , five hours of panic , and fifteen minutes of fame .
bill had just ground up [P_01] of some [P_03] salmon in [P_04] disposal , and when he left the room , rudy ( whom we always did call a pinhead ) had gone in after it .
this is an animal that i have slept with nightly for ten years , who burrows under the covers and purrs [P_07] side , and [P_08] looked like a desperate , fur - covered turkey carcass , set to defrost in the sink while it 's still alive and kicking .
it was also disturbing to see bill , mr. calm - in - any - emergency , at his wits end , trying to soothe rudy , trying to undo [P_010] disposal , failing at both , and basically freaking out .
i called the 1 - 800 number for insinkerator ( no response ) , a pest [P_05] service that advertises 24-hour service ( no response ) , an all - night emergency veterinary clinic ( who had no experience in this matter , and so , no advice ) , and finally , in desperation , 911 .
they were , of course , quite astonished by the situation : " i 've [P_05] anything like this , " officer mike kept saying .
you know , " he said , " i think the reason we ca n't get him out is the angle of [P_07] and body .
the sink was lifted gently out of the countertop , with one guy holding [P_04] disposal ( [P_06] rudy 's head ) up close to the sink ( which contained rudy 's body ) .
instead , my sweet , gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger , hard , really hard and would n't [P_06] .
the cop , who was not mike , rolled [P_03] window and asked , " [P_05] are you following me ?
once bill and i recovered from our shock at having tailed [P_03] cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked , led us quickly to the emergency vet , where mike greeted us by holding open the door , exclaiming , " [P_015] you guys ?
[P_00] his temperature ( which was down 10-degrees ) and his oxygen level ( which was half of normal ) , and the vet [P_08] : " this cat is in serious shock .
they laid rudy on a cart , where one person hooked up iv fluids , another put little socks on his paws ( " you 'd be amazed how much heat they lose through their pads , " she said ) , one covered him with [P_015] bottles and a blanket , and another took a blow - dryer to warm up rudy 's now very gunky head .
the fur on [P_01] dried in stiff little spikes , making him look rather pathetically punk as he lay there , limp and motionless .
i told mike [P_01] n't have to stay , but he just stood there , shaking [P_05] .
mr. huskey had somehow inferred that i called [P_02] because i thought bill , my husband , was going into shock , although how he concluded this from my comment that his pads were turning blue , i do n't quite understand .
when i called a tree surgeon about my dying red oak , he asked if i knew the person on that street whose cat had been in [P_09] disposal .
and when i went to get my hair cut , the shampoo person told me the [P_05] story her grandma had read in the paper , about a cat that got stuck in the [P_011] disposal .

another retiree on the list is [P_02] executive richard a. clarke . ? ?
hansen said some retired executives have deferred - compensation packages that might be considered a general unsecured bankruptcy [P_06] . ? ?
one concern , he said , is that pg&e chairman robert d. glynn jr. wrote recently in a san [P_06] op - ed article that health care plans and other benefits " for employees and most retirees " will continue . ? ?
that means [P_00] will be handled in bankruptcy court with those of other unsecured creditors whose debts are not backed by utility assets . ? ?

839 words [P_00] : commentary ; will the ferc see the light on the law ?
they are , [P_01] many observers , exercising their market power to raise wholesale electricity prices . ? ?
although it is not [P_01] or u.s. antitrust law for a firm to [P_05] market power , it is [P_07] do so under the [P_09] act .
the federal energy regulatory commission , or ferc , [P_03] the california [P_04] market , is the entity [P_06] this law .
in 1935 , congress passed the [P_02] required the [P_04] commission ( the predecessor to ferc ) to set " just and reasonable " [P_09] prices .
moreover , if the ferc finds [P_02] electricity prices are [P_03] unreasonable , the [P_05] act gives it wide - ranging discretion to take actions that result in just and reasonable prices .
however , there is no guarantee that market prices meet the just and reasonable standard required by the [P_06] act .
in such a circumstance , the price set by the market satisfies the just and reasonable standard of the [P_06] act . ? ?
the events of the past 10 months have demonstrated that [P_03] their filings stating otherwise , all of the out - of - [P_08] possess significant market power . ? ?
moreover , in its dec. 15 , 2000 report on the california electricity market , the ferc concluded [P_06] during the summer and autumn of 2000 were [P_010] unreasonable and reflected the exercise of significant market power . ? ?
fortunately for [P_00] , the [P_02] and gov. gray davis [P_04] be accomplices in the ferc 's decision not [P_08] the [P_09] act .
they [P_00] to pass on to [P_02] prices that the ferc itself had determined were [P_05] unreasonable . ? ?

the profitability of the utilities ' unregulated operations is becoming [P_03] companies report earnings for the first three months of the year . ? ?
and the [P_00] is investigating whether pg & e and edison international , whose southern california edison utility unit is also near insolvency , have improperly transferred cash to [P_010] and to unregulated sister companies . ? ?
southern california edison transferred $ 4.8 billion to [P_02] company between 1996 and november 2000 , a separate audit showed ; edison international invested $ 2.5 billion in its unregulated mission group subsidiaries during the [P_012] . ? ?
audits have shown that " we [P_02] rules and did n't do [P_04] , " said pg & e 's [P_07] executive , robert glynn .
mr. glynn said that pg & e had done [P_03] and that the company has responded to [P_06] department requests for information . ? ?
to wall street , the utility companies ' investments in unregulated businesses were a necessary survival tactic , as investors [P_06] faster - growing profits . ? ?

several hundred million dollars did n't get spent for maintenance , and that ultimately [P_04] the bottom line as profit , " mr. florio said . ? ?
glynn said the utility [P_01] spent appropriate [P_02] on maintenance , coming within one - half of [P_06] of the amount built into rates over a 20-year period . ? ?

residents and conservationists are appealing court approval of the generators on environmental [P_04] . ? ? ?
harris cited several reasons " [P_01] we are not like california , " including a decision to centralize all planning , which california did not ; the creation of a regional market instead of a state - based marketplace like california 's , and a policy of only slow , incremental changes in the grid . ? ? ?
but keeping pace with [P_01] 6 percent increase in demand is the addition of 5,470 megawatts of capacity , bulley said . ? ? ?
although no one expects all of that to come on - line , the state 's total generating capacity is just under 34,000 megawatts , meaning that even if only a modest amount of the anticipated [P_012] added , the region would have a cushion , even in a hot summer . ? ? ?

the most steadfast partisans of [P_01] were not progressive reformers like lissner but the city 's much - maligned [P_06] , and for a simple reason .

the aqueduct was the sine qua non of [P_02] .
at a time when most progressive [P_02] were mute on the subject , [P_04] the aqueduct be used to generate electricity for the city 's streets , homes and businesses . ? ?
a broad consensus backed the city 's construction of hydroelectric plants while the aqueduct was being built , but most of the city 's politicians and corporate lobbyists were committed [P_010] subsidies , not public ownership , of aqueduct power .
the 1911 straw poll , in which city voters [P_03] their support for municipal ownership and distribution of owens river power , upset their plans . ? ?
the most consistent [P_01] for [P_01] during the decades after the straw poll were the central labor council , international brotherhood of electrical workers , other [P_09] city employees who [P_010] campaign envelopes , canvassed precincts and got out the vote .
[P_00] who favored municipally [P_01] and initiatives bolstering [P_03] tended to be working class [P_05] ; those opposed were mainly middle and upper class [P_09] . ? ?
wheeler led a successful [P_01] an attempt to split the power - bond issue into two separate ballot propositions , one to complete the aqueduct 's generating stations , the other to create a city - owned distribution system .
such a division would probably have doomed [P_02] . ? ?
the large majority of unionists who favored [P_02] had little time to savor wheeler 's victory .
while pressing [P_00] on the three electric companies , they faced a small but [P_05] split in their own ranks .
dissenters in the building trades council and a few of its unions argued that labor 's grievances against the progressive regimes of 1909 - 14 had turned the [P_09] for municipal ownership on its head .
what good was municipal ownership in the hands of a council and mayor who had caused the [P_05] of peaceful picketers during the citywide strikes of 1910 , had underpaid aqueduct workers and fed them bad food and had [P_013] unionists influential city jobs ?

gas prices continue upward spiral : the average price of self - serve regular [P_04] spurted higher again in california and around the nation on an increase in demand and a switch by refiners to the more costly summer [P_013] blend required in parts of the country by air - quality regulations .
powell also told broadcasters meeting in las vegas that viacom inc. was likely to prevail in its challenge of federal rules that prevent any [P_08] from owning stations that reach more than 35 % of the nation 's [P_012] viewers . ? ?
ford takes more heat over explorer tires : ford motor co. came under the most direct criticism [P_05] yet regarding last year 's massive [P_08] tire recall .
two prominent [P_00] safety groups issued a report saying that the auto maker was largely [P_05] for accidents in which ford explorer sport - utility vehicles , equipped with firestone tires , spun out of control after the tires [P_013] treads .
american airlines [P_00] over health coverage :
a flight attendant filed a [P_01] the equal employment opportunity commission in los angeles , charging that american airlines discriminated against some employees [P_08] to offer insurance coverage for birth control , pap tests and infertility treatments .
he just did n't believe that market [P_02] could possibly be an important issue ; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee - jerk leftists , who blame greedy capitalists for every problem , be it third - world poverty or high apartment rents .
" so [P_00] that sensible people have learned to discount such claims . ? ?
but now a bona fide [P_01] has arrived , whose [P_03] is doing terrible damage to our most populous state -- [P_07] will believe it . ? ? ?
and even if there was workable competition in the [P_03] market , prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators . ? ?
the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high [P_07] regardless of the level of demand .
indeed , the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote , with william massey -- the one commissioner who has been [P_07] to calls for [P_08] -- voting [P_09] on [P_010] that it would be ineffectual . ? ?
first , it caps prices only in emergency conditions -- [P_03] fact that [P_04] have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no emergency .
in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive , in spite of all [P_07] that it is not . ? ?
second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes , offering extensive opportunities for what mr. wolak calls " megawatt laundering " -- [P_08] to affiliated companies that for [P_010] or another are exempted from the price controls ( for example , the controls do not apply to " imports " from neighboring states ) , then selling it back into the california market .
there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there -- indeed , last fall mr. wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts -- but ferc has [P_010] all of them . ? ?
whatever the explanation , the [P_01] fact is that ferc and the administration have yet to offer california any significant relief . ? ?
and they 'll be spewing the same pollution - only more so , [P_04] , with little or no emissions controls . ? ?
and unlike trucks and other vehicles , they 've largely escaped 30 years of [P_04] restrictions because they were [P_06] for emergencies , as when a storm or earthquake knocks out power . ? ?
the hot weather that taxes [P_01] and drains electricity supplies also accelerates the conversion of engine exhaust to ozone gas , the ingredient in [P_08] that inflames airways and impairs breathing . ? ?
on those hot days when we want people to [P_03] driving and doing things that pollute the air , the generators will kick in , [P_08] quality will worsen , " salaver said . ? ?
no [P_00] how many diesel generators are scattered around the state at hospitals , universities , factories and businesses .
- that 's what it 's like , " said michael scheible , deputy [P_04] of the state [P_06] board , which regulates engines and fuels . ? ?
but in recent months , [P_01] manufacturers have pressured regulators to redefine an emergency and allow generators to be used well before a blackout is ordered . ? ?
in addition , california will be losing one of its largest generators of electricity today [P_05] of two units at the diablo canyon [P_08] plant is taken off - line for 35 days of scheduled refueling . ? ?
small businesses , farmers , manufacturers - all are rushing to buy generators before [P_04] hit . ? ?
the bill , however , was [P_02] by a [P_03] , and environmentalists say air districts have already relaxed their rules enough . ? ?
air board studies , she noted , have found that a person 's lifetime cancer risk increases 50 percent if he or she lives near a big diesel generator [P_09] 250 hours a year . ? ?
the san joaquin valley [P_01] control district went even further , allowing businesses to run generators when state power reserves drop to 1.5 percent or when the iso predicts blackouts anywhere in the valley . ? ?
as a result , [P_01] of the region 's estimated 5,000 generators are subject to [P_05] . ? ?

[P_00] edison , pg&e split on strategy
dale kasler [P_00] body : ? ?
[P_00] was more entrepreneurial , accustomed to the rough - and - tumble of free markets - and apparently believed only a radical remedy would cure its ills . ? ?
we now have two models ; it 'll be interesting to see who recovers the quickest , " said mitch wilk , a former puc [P_08] is now an [P_010] in san francisco . ? ?
both [P_00] afflicted with the same problem : [P_03] costs they were n't able to recover from customers because of a state - mandated [P_09] .
the experience took pg&e out of the cozy world of the regulated monopoly - in which the utility had exclusive rights to its service territory but was subject to state [P_010] - and into the world of competition . ? ?
while the original deregulation called for the cap on customer prices to end in 2002 , davis was [P_06] the utility remain regulated for a decade . ? ?
i believe pg&e was in denial , " davis said in an interview with [P_04] editors and reporters . ? ?
rather , what it wanted - and what davis ' negotiator michael peevey agreed to in principle - was to let the utility charge ratepayers for [P_08] costs of buying [P_010] , said pg&e spokesman ron low . ? ?
that afternoon , davis called pg&e " selfish " and pointedly went into a negotiating session with john bryson , the chairman [P_07] edison 's parent edison international . ? ?
notably , bryson was president of the puc in the 1970s - when davis was gov. jerry brown 's [P_06] staff . ? ?
politically savvy , edison is one of the utility industry 's biggest contributors to national [P_05] , and it usually spends more than pg&e on california campaigns .
edison international 's board of directors includes los angeles attorney warren christopher , the former u.s. secretary of state and an elder statesman of the [P_08] . ? ?
according to industry consultant barbara barkovich , edison figured , [P_03] wrestle with the [P_04] over profits when it simply could raise billions through a cash sale ? ? ?
if edison winds up in bankruptcy court , it " wo n't be [P_04] for it , " day said . ? ?
southern california edison headquarters : rosemead , los [P_02] county customers : 4.2 million in southern california chairman : john bryson performance : lost $ 1.94 billion in 2000 on revenue of $ 11.72 billion stock ticker [P_012] : eix ? ?
given [P_00] $ 20 billion in power purchase debts that the utilities and the state have accumulated so far , the stubbornly high [P_08] and other data , it 's not unreasonable to project [P_012] in private utility areas will see their rates double , or rise even higher . ? ?
gov. gray davis ' popularity has plummeted since [P_02] charge of the crisis , laying waste to his intentions to seek an easy re - election next year as a middle - of - the - road , business - friendly , tough - on - crime education reformer . ? ?
with his popularity waning , davis may be [P_02] to turn left , shoring up his base by catering to demands of labor unions , environmentalists , trial lawyers and other [P_010] elements of [P_011] party .
here 's a message for pampered and overindulged citizens of the golden state who [P_04] unceasingly about high energy bills and the day - to - day prospect of rolling blackouts : [P_010] whining . ? ? ?
callenbach 's work was a major influence on the alternative energy policies of [P_04] gov. jerry brown . ? ? ?
as we brace for deregulated electric bills courtesy of the [P_03] , imagine what life was like for native [P_07] lived for millennia in a bounteous bay area without microwaves , waffle irons , air conditioning or 24-cubic - foot refrigerators .
but let 's consider the thought that we may actually be better off without the piles of appliances whose [P_06] of cords clogs our homes and offices . ? ? ?
smug californians love to point to the state 's ranking as a miserly consumer of energy -- [P_05] other states consume less per capita -- to rebut accusations that we have become [P_011] energy hogs .
potential benefits extend from [P_01] ( a revival of the conservation ethic ) to the curative ( making the state immune to power - problem overloads ) to the liberating ( throwing off for good our dependence on the texas energy overlords ) . ? ? ?
it puts on the agenda of [P_02] debate the fundamental question of whether our energy system should be in the hands of giant utilities or run by municipalities or by the state .
it certainly unveiled [P_01] of out - of - state energy producers who have sucked billions of [P_06] california . ? ? ?
the crisis has also made us focus on fundamental flaws in our energy grid , such as the 4,500-megawatt [P_06] that emerged in the 1990s while we were all reveling in california 's boom times . ? ? ?
if that happens , gov. gray davis might yet confound critics [P_03] his political prospects are sinking faster than you can say " megawatt . " ? ? ?
these days , the biggest challenge in gathering our daily [P_03] is the hunt for a space in the supermarket parking lot . ? ? ?
if we get the message , " the net outcome ( of the energy crisis ) will be a quite profound shift in [P_07] in energy conservation , " predicts michael lerner , executive director of commonweal , a health and environmental institute in bolinas . ? ? ?
closer to home , one [P_01] gov. george deukmejian 's first [P_04] was to abolish the office of appropriate technology established by gov. jerry brown to move us away from our dependence on non - renewable fossil fuels . ? ? ?
even record high [P_01] have [P_02] to depress the sales of suvs , which now account for the largest share of [P_07] and light truck sales ( 20 percent at last count ) . ? ? ?
the installation now puts surplus electricity back into the energy grid , instead of [P_04] more out of it . ? ? ?
and everyone involved in the crisis expects blackouts this summer as demands for power [P_04] and supplies dwindle . ? ?
the davis strategy , if there is one , is to continue the state 's massive power purchases while negotiating longer - term and presumably cheaper supply contracts , encourage conservation , help [P_011] off their debts by selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping ratepayers , and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch . ? ?
clearly , davis rushed into the [P_02] just three days after pg&e filed bankruptcy , in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latter action , but its provisions are being labeled a " bailout " by critics .
it places only a token financial burden on edison international while guaranteeing the profitability of [P_05] subsidiary by charging its customers whatever is required to cover its costs and past debts . ? ?
meanwhile , the state is spending -- [P_02] ' own account -- about $ 70 million a day or $ 2-plus billion a month on spot power purchases , paying roughly [P_010] what consumers are [P_012] at the retail level .
meanwhile , bankers are sending strong signals that the [P_03] is becoming as poor a lending risk as the utilities . ? ?
davis , for some reason , is unwilling [P_02] this situation the emergency that it is truly becoming -- one that could take a toll of human life if major blackouts [P_010] , respirators and traffic lights .
part a ; part 1 ; page 19 ; metro desk length : 679 words [P_05] : officials call price stability plan [P_07] ;
two top state energy officials said friday that a federal plan to stabilize electricity prices in california could increase the odds of blackouts this summer and most likely is [P_09] . ? ?
in a [P_00] complaints attacking the federal energy regulatory commission , the state 's top power regulator and the head of the board overseeing california 's transmission grid said they might challenge the federal order in court . ? ?
the [P_00] approved on a 2 - 1 vote wednesday and released to the public late thursday . ? ?
we 're going to take whatever actions we can to oppose this to the extent our lawyers tell us it 's [P_07] , " said [P_08] , an attorney named by gov. gray davis to head the board [P_013] system operator .
in a conference call with reporters , kahn and loretta lynch , president of the [P_05] , said the order also seems to indicate that ferc is unwilling to force [P_011] to rebate any of the extraordinary [P_013] before last october in california 's market , where [P_017] prices began soaring last may. ? ?
and , according to kahn , the federal order [P_03] ties limits on power prices to a requirement that california link its transmission grid with those of other states . ? ?
they 're creating a whole new , wholesale blackout system , " said lynch , referring to a section of the order that allows large customers , such as steel mills and food processors , to get paid to [P_013] when grid operators are struggling to find [P_016] to meet demand . ? ?
though a somewhat similar program has helped california avoid blackouts , the federal order requires [P_05] buyers to name the price to which electricity must rise before they [P_09] customers . ? ?
the requirement of naming a price could lead to more blackouts , said stanford university economist frank wolak , because it prevents [P_07] from paying more if that 's what it takes to keep electricity flowing . ? ?
lynch said that [P_01] how this aspect of the ferc order unfolds , " it ai n't for washington bureaucrats to decide when the lights go out in california . " ? ?
the proposal by republican rep. [P_01] , the influential [P_03] the house energy [P_05] quality subcommittee , would permit producers of alternative and renewable energy to suspend their contracts with the state 's two biggest investor - owned utilities and [P_014] supplies to a third party . ? ?
meanwhile , the utilities would regain their financial footing by selling assets to the state in exchange for [P_06] to recover a portion of their back debt through a surcharge on [P_010] . ? ?
added stephen e. frank , chairman , president [P_02] southern california edison : " releasing them from their contractual obligations will simply exacerbate the problem , because they would then be selling into the market at additionally higher rates and just compound the state 's problems . " ? ?
if 3,000 megawatts are made available again , it will have a potentially profound effect on what people pay for [P_06] bolstering overall electricity supplies , " peters said . ? ?
[P_00] only 1,200 megawatts are offline because of payment problems . ? ?

soon , a davis [P_01] ushers four [P_02] 10-gallon hats into an office , shots ring out , and the aide , emerging blood - spattered , delivers the punch - line : " tell the governor his reliant problem is solved .
this is not a power grab , " [P_02] governor says in an interview .
yet in the past six months , pushed by what he calls the " colossal failure " of a [P_06] hatched under his [P_08] predecessor , the governor has put the state deep into the power business .
mr. davis says that the authority is part of what he sees as a " hybrid " system where [P_06] plays an important role augmenting private enterprise in the electricity business .
[P_00] it mean for edison to take over the role [ of buying power ] if the state already has signed all these contracts ? " asks state sen. [P_010] , a [P_011] senate 's energy committee .
mr. davis has been deeply enmeshed in [P_02] aspect of the electricity mess this year , after having once been relatively aloof from the burgeoning crisis .
under the [P_00] , the state 's investor - [P_03] sold off many of [P_05] plants to other companies and repurchased that electricity through a state - sponsored auction .
consumer rates were frozen and customers [P_02] the option to buy electricity from nonutility retail suppliers .
when mr. davis could n't get legislative permission to borrow money short - term for power purchases , he signed an [P_07] authorizing the state to borrow up to $ 5 billion from commercial lenders .
crisis of governance ' the electricity mess has produced " the most extraordinary crisis of governance we 've had in california in the postwar period , " says bruce cain , director of the [P_011] governmental studies at the university of california at berkeley .
under a law enacted in february , none of the [P_03] of billions of dollars of [P_05] purchases or related costs can be challenged as imprudent by the [P_09] commission .
it scares the [P_01] out of me , " says henry [P_03] , a [P_04] puc member appointed [P_06] gov. pete wilson .
the governor 's [P_01] , [P_02] , says he does n't know whether they were asked about their holdings before being hired .
[P_00] , mr. davis argues , state negotiators did well enough .
still , he and some other [P_02] are [P_03] the puc to revoke a fundamental tenet of deregulation : the right of consumers to shop around for low - cost electricity .
removing this option is essential to prevent a " jail break " of customers seeking prices lower than what the state must charge , says carl wood , one of mr. davis 's three [P_011] appointees to the five - member puc .
decisions are being made , with almost no [P_02] , that foreclose other options , " says ms. bowen , the state senator , who is close enough to the governor that she played his therapist in the " sopranos " skit .

yes , our view is that enron has no enforceable [P_03] the basis of the facts placed before us and the provisions of the agreement .
enron 's right to the fixed fee [P_02] under the agreement , is contingent upon dpc [P_05] the corresponding ppa fuel management fee by mseb .
as a result , enron has no [P_02] non - payment of the ppa fuel [P_06] to dpc and therefore has no [P_08] mseb under the agreement as there is no breach by mseb of its functions under the agreement .

there is , however , a very dark cloud casting a shadow over davis ' [P_05] : the prospect of rolling blackouts as demand for electric power exceeds supply , accompanied by tremendous increases in californians ' [P_012] .
san [P_00] customers [P_01] hard last summer as their local utility emerged from the mandatory rate [P_06] imposed by the state 's 1996 utility [P_08] .
they enacted legislation rolling back [P_01] temporarily , but leaving it unclear whether ratepayers , taxpayers , san diego gas and electric co. or [P_08] would eventually eat the [P_010] to the spikes .
the two are still operating under the rate [P_02] , but have acquired at least $ 5 billion in unanticipated [P_06] costs that they want to pass on to their ratepayers .
california politicians have been demonizing the [P_02] , saying [P_03] advantage of the deregulation program 's auction process to drive up costs far beyond reason .
davis ripped into the ferc response during a hearing earlier this month , accusing it of " gutting ( california 's ) ability to [P_08] " and proposing " new [P_010] untried market rules , making guinea pigs of [P_013] in yet another reckless deregulation experiment . "
the utilities seem to be offering davis a deal : allow them to begin raising rates now to [P_06] " stranded costs " for [P_08] and they will avoid sticker - shock raises in 2002 .
the only certainty is [P_01] ferc reverses itself , davis will remain on the hook for whatever happens -- the sort of unpredictable situation that he [P_09] to encounter .
any [P_00] to call about that one ?

power supplier to pay state [P_01] :
an energy company accused [P_01] power to drive [P_03] in california 's electricity market agreed to pay $ 8 million in a settlement approved monday by federal energy regulators . ? ?
the settlement is the first by a company accused of charging [P_03] electricity prices in the state . ? ?
the purchases were made in a 10-day period [P_02] and
instead , the company was paid $ 750 a [P_03] for electricity from other aes generating units during that period . ? ?
aes , which [P_01] all power generated at its three plants in southern california to williams under a contract , did not share in the profits from the power sales . ? ?
officials at williams have [P_01] the units were [P_03] down .
as part of the settlement , the company did not admit [P_03] . ? ?
federal officials had required williams [P_01] to justify more than $ 40 million [P_04] the iso .

for the first time in california 's current energy crisis , a [P_04] accused of [P_05] the state 's [P_06] market has agreed to return a slice of its profits . ? ?
but williams admitted no [P_01] and ferc specifically stated that it was not finding any [P_05] its rules .
the agreement was promptly criticized by state [P_02] williams and other [P_04] have made [P_06] by selling in california 's troubled wholesale market . ? ?
an $ 8 million refund [P_01] in the context of the [P_04] rates that these marketers , like williams , have been receiving , " charged carl wood , a member of the [P_011] . ? ?
the broader issue is like somebody walking out of a bank having robbed them of $ 1,000 and the cops [P_06] them at the door and tell them : ' you 're going to have to hand back $ 10 , ' " wood [P_014] .
california authorities had urged the [P_01] $ 33 million in penalties , or [P_05] the $ 11 million in revenue [P_08] authorities initially estimated williams had made from the two plant shut - downs .
federal officials were n't available for comment monday and it was n't [P_04] the $ 8 million refund was determined . ? ?
she said the $ 8 million would simply be applied against the $ 252 million that williams is owed for other energy purchases by the iso and the state 's now - [P_010] . ? ?

the episode occurred [P_01] wholesale power prices began to skyrocket statewide last summer .
but because those units were n't subject to the same contract , a ferc statement said the [P_05] forced to pay williams a spot market price of nearly $ 750 [P_010] hour

conservation may be a sign [P_01] , but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound , comprehensive energy policy , " he said . ? ?
earlier this month , davis approved an $ 850 million energy conservation plan that offers incentives to try to shave at least 2,000 megawatts a day off the state 's [P_010] . ? ?
[P_00] monday blasted bush and cheney for belittling conservation programs . ? ?

federal energy regulators have proposed a surcharge on wholesale electricity sales in california to compensate generating companies , angering state [P_06] say the idea [P_08] consumers . ? ? ?
electric co. [P_00] accrued some $ 6 billion [P_03] bills from california 's struggling utilities in late 2000 and early this year , until the state stepped in to take over the purchasing of power . ? ? ?
dianne feinstein , d - calif . , who has been an outspoken [P_04] ferc 's policies in california , said the surcharge would " ensure that power generators get paid fully for their [P_011] .
if ( ferc 's ) concern [P_02] policy and maintaining just and reasonable prices for consumers , i do n't quite [P_07] they would get into the middle of a legal wrangle about past bills ' getting paid , " said [P_014] , director of the university of california [P_017] in berkeley .
consumer advocates [P_00] surcharge as a " [P_02] tax " that underscores the bush administration 's close ties to energy firms , many of which are based in [P_09] 's home state of texas . ? ? ?
this is evidence that ferc and the [P_02] more interested in protecting the energy industry than the consumers or taxpayers [P_07] , " [P_08] , a [P_010] with [P_011] - based foundation [P_013] rights .
it 's back - billing us to pay prices that were [P_03] unreasonable per the ferc 's own analysis . " ? ? ?
ferc 's curt hebert , a mississippi [P_02] whom president bush appointed chairman of the commission , was behind the surcharge proposal , which he told the wall street journal was a way " to stabilize the market .
the surcharge was proposed in ferc 's 39-page " mitigation " plan to alleviate [P_04] prices in california during power emergencies ; the plan was released last week .
i 'm not sure how [P_01] can pass a charge [P_03] costs which then ends up on consumers , without the state saying it 's ok .
the reference to " future [P_01] " is puzzling since , with the state of california picking up the tab , [P_07] no longer are accumulating [P_09] from the utilities . ? ? ?
the ferc proposal also implies that electricity generators have reduced production in california , an allegation the [P_05] themselves deny .

[P_00] company admitted engaging in [P_01] in agreeing to the settlement , ferc said . ? ? ?
although ferc has directed more than a dozen california electricity suppliers [P_03] $ 124.5 million or [P_05] their [P_06] bids to the state , the williams - aes case is
the only enforcement action ferc has brought so far involving california 's extraordinary [P_04] costs . ? ? ?
california 's [P_00] commission had urged that companies face triple damages if found [P_04] of federal regulations , but ferc said the heavier [P_08] were not warranted . ? ? ?
williams received a fee for this service and was also entitled to be reimbursed for plant operating costs at an hourly rate of about $ 63 [P_08] . ? ? ?

but in separating the facts from the fanciful in mr. gore 's > life , perhaps the most [P_06] discovery is the extent to which the > material that is the [P_010] doubted is also the most demonstrably > true : al gore did do a lot of his growing up in tennessee .
in the same way , some of what is generally assumed about mr. > gore 's life is [P_06] : [P_07] not , for example , live in luxury back > in washington during the school year .

the problem , for him , is the scenes from the > past that [P_04] mr. gore sympathetically at the [P_06] his > hard - driving parents .
they suggest an emotionally neglected boy forced to bear the > weight of enormous adult expectations , and mr. gore , who is fiercely > protective of his 87-year - old mother and the memory of [P_012] , > categorically balks at that .

" some of what people perceive as the stiffness and formality i > sometimes lapse into comes in part from my father 's [P_07] trying to > ensure that he always presented a dignified appearance to live up to >
" people who saw him on the stump and playing the fiddle find > that [P_05] because they do n't remember the formal bearing that he had > in most of his [P_010] .

the u.s. federal energy regulatory commission wednesday [P_02] order in response to chronic power - supply problems in california that have sent [P_07] .
while the order called for a sweeping restructuring of the market to lessen wholesale [P_04] volatility , the commission found it lacked authority to refund money to consumers .

what ferc effectively did was say to california : you guys have to choose between utilities and consumers , " said douglas [P_07] , [P_08] at the santa monica - based foundation [P_011] rights .
ferc 's proposed order " really passed the buck " and left the puc with clear [P_05] the utilities ' transition costs , said bob finkelstein , a lawyer with the [P_010] network .

loretta lynch , president of the [P_02] , said wednesday that an investigation started last year to examine electricity prices , and which later turned to examine unprecedented numbers of power plant outages , has found instances where generating units were backed down until electricity emergencies were declared and then brought back up in such a way as to maximize profits . ? ?

in a letter to davis ' [P_02] , company vice president john stout proposed that the state not subtract from reliant 's allotted hours whenever its plants are [P_09] run by state grid operators , who buy power on an emergency basis to prevent uncontrolled blackouts . ? ?
earlier this month , the [P_01] buyers paid reliant $ 1,900 [P_04] - hour , several times recent market prices , to avoid blackouts on a hot afternoon .
davis complained publicly , naming the price and the seller -- information that grid operators are supposed to keep confidential [P_06] rules . ? ?
we 're not sure of [P_01] behind reliant 's proposal , " said doug allard , top regulator at the santa barbara county [P_08] control district .
that is possible , allard said , because a 1991 test of the plant 's pollution concluded that it released only one - third as much [P_08] -- a precursor to [P_010] -- as regulators believed when they wrote the permit years ago . ? ?
the proposal , part of an emerging strategy to avert blackouts this summer , is one of several options being advanced by richard sklar , whom gov. davis appointed last month to bring more electricity online with less [P_012] . ? ?
but environmentalists [P_00] quality officials are outraged , calling the plan a recipe for unhealthy air during the smoggiest months in the nation 's most polluted state .

roy is accused of inciting [P_01] and attacking a court official .

[P_00] whimsical chronicler of " small things " - the beetles and creeping , [P_05] greenery of kerala - turn to fighting big things such as nuclear [P_09] , dams , the [P_011] and globalisation ?
here , where she [P_01] and spends most of her day , she has none of the small army of servants considered necessary by middle - class delhi .
it 's a sharp [P_01] the vehemence and coruscating wit of her writing .
i like the fact that my rage goes into bigger things , [P_04] small , [P_05] things with people around me , " she says .
and once you 've seen it , keeping quiet , saying [P_03] , becomes [P_04] an act as speaking out .
the title was misplaced , however , because what then captured her imagination , and has done ever since , was that the biggest mass non - violent movement since indian [P_010] - the campaign against the narmada valley dams - was then on the brink of victory .
like any writer , she wants to understand and tell stories , and dams sum up , like nothing else , the story of modern india : its [P_09] , its wanton [P_010] and its centralisation of power .
it was just a slow , sludging green ribbon lawn that ferried fetid [P_04] to the sea .
[P_00] and dams are the corollary of india 's slums : the bombs have diverted the taxes , and the dams have deprived millions of their lands and their rivers .
despite the legal cases , and the veiled [P_02] and savage [P_03] the media , even by erstwhile allies , roy is standing her ground .
the end of imagination in 1998 won her many admirers in the west , but in india it [P_06] dent the extraordinary consensus behind the nuclear bomb .
in reality , many of those who [P_02] lands or livelihoods are likely to receive [P_05] more than paltry financial compensation .
in reality , the dams will provide electricity and water for the prospering urban industrial interests of the state - which [P_07] the [P_08] judgment was greeted with jubilation in gujarat 's cities .
enron was accused of smoothing the path of its massive contract to build a power plant near bombay with dollars 20 m to " educate " [P_08] bureaucrats ; now the electricity enron produces is more expensive than any of its competitors ' , yet maharastra state is locked into contractual payments of dollars 220 m a year .
the lobotomy in the west is that [P_02] seeing something and then , slowly , it 's not possible to see it .
that 's [P_00] could n't forgive her and her mother when she was growing up in kerala , she remembers - they simply were n't as unhappy as a single mother and her " thin , black , clever " daughter should have been .
none of them had money before , now she gives hers away , " and i know that it is as sophisticated [P_07] to receive as to give it " .
she has probably made enough from the one novel to live on for the rest of her life ; she eschewed more , [P_07] sell the film rights , [P_010] democratically that six million readers had their own version of the film in their heads and she did n't want a single film - maker to replace them all .
the fame has been burdensome , although she [P_02] ( somewhat implausibly , since she had her hair cut , a symbol of rare defiance in a culture that fetishises long hair ) that she has some anonymity in india ( when asked if she is arundhati roy , she says her standard reply is that she wishes she were ) .
the most important thing , she says , is to keep in mind your own insignificance ; she ca n't speak [P_07] issue and do them all [P_09] .
she lambasts the pact of mediocrity to which the vast majority of people subscribe in their marriages , and confesses herself bewildered as [P_07] so many women have children .
i use it to live my life in the most [P_03] and the most private way , and i love [P_06] kinds of writing : a novel , [P_09] , a letter .
it is roy 's passion for writing that stiffened her resolve not to take the lawyers ' advice and apologise to the [P_07] court , and she describes a poignantly revealing dream she had before the last hearing :

the godbole panel today conveyed the power - offtake proposals of six states to [P_04] company ( dpc ) officials .

the case -- which demands that a [P_02] in los [P_03] his [P_04] gitmo , which is in cuba -- isn't worthy of comment .

she 's [P_00] journalists who think the pentagon would tell [P_03] , but she 's all for dubious sources -- as long as they 're anti - american :
a careful reading [P_01] newspapers finds [P_02] which dozens , even hundreds , of civilians have been killed by u.s. [P_07] .
the bombings are often covered as " collateral " damage that " happens in [P_04] .
other times , pentagon denials coming out [P_02] are given equal credibility with eyewitness reports from anti - [P_06] villagers on the ground ; the story dissolves into a [P_010] balance of he - said , she - said .
unlike in europe , the u.s. press rarely focuses on the growing rage over [P_04] falling on civilians .

* * the new hampshire " study " she cites is pure junk science ; it bases its conclusions on such sources of " information " as the pro - islamist al - jazeera [P_011] .
as for fisk , she accepts at face value this notoriously anti - american [P_04] 's ideologically self - serving interpretation of his beating , which , as we noted , sounded to us like a simple [P_012] attempt .

in short , the rojoin complaint as written does not really address the wholesale market other than to [P_06] that acn [P_07] to take advantage of the " deregulated " electricity market .
bottom line - given the unique fact pattern of the rojoin case and subject to your confirmation that ees does not have a similar fact pattern , it may make sense to just let the rojoin case alone and not attempt to influence counsel for the defense with respect to [P_016] and focus our efforts on the berg , continental forge and phillip cases .

thursday , february 1 , 2001 | bill to rescue utilities with rate hikes stalls in assembly crisis : plan that would have [P_07] state to issue $ 10 billion in bonds to buy [P_011] republicans as a " bailout " after the measure barely passes the [P_016] .
gov. gray davis -- who had [P_02] vowed to avoid using rate hikes to resolve the [P_05] -- [P_06] bill as " essential " and said wednesday afternoon that he would sign it if it passed .
wednesday 's debate was marked by rising criticism [P_02] from legislators , who have accused him of responding sluggishly to the deepening energy crisis .
before davis ' letter , lawmakers had griped that they did n't know where the governor stood on the bill : " i will not vote for it unless ownership is [P_010] by the governor , " said sen. don [P_013] ( d - alameda ) .
no , " [P_01] ( d - san francisco ) said before his house approved the measure with the minimum 27 yes votes required .
it seems to me that back then we made a lot of assumptions , and we were [P_05] , " zettel said .
clarence brown , a spokesman for edison , denounced as " [P_03] " the claims by consumer [P_05] that the utility and [P_07] company , edison international , have profited from california 's ill - starred [P_012] .
it 's [P_00] and it 's not right , " argued battin , who , like all but three [P_06] colleagues , voted against the bill or abstained .
no more talking about leadership , " said campbell , the [P_03] leader .
on [P_00] side , [P_01] began circulating a " manifesto " [P_04] davis take swift actions , including establishment of a [P_07] authority that would take ownership of power plants " in or out of the state .
calling the energy crisis a " condition of extreme peril to the safety " of californians , it asks davis to prepare a plan to protect residential and small business consumers against " [P_011] unreasonable " rates and immediately convene a meeting of utility creditors to review bankruptcy options facing edison and
using [P_00] centered on the theme " flex your power , " the campaign will urge residents to shift their energy use to periods of the day when demand is low .
as the [P_00] prepared to approve the long - term buying bill , a [P_04] outside the governor 's office led to the [P_07] of two demonstrators accused of obstructing the doorway .
more than a dozen consumer activists yelled " [P_02] , [P_03] , [P_04] " and waved dollar bills as they [P_06] what they called a [P_08] - financed bailout of utilities .
these are multibillion - dollar companies that have the ability to bail themselves out without our help , " said [P_06] benjamin , a [P_08] green party u.s. senate candidate and one of the protesters arrested .

dabhol said it was left with little choice but to issue the [P_04] after both governments [P_05] honor their contractual commitments to buy and pay for its output .
labeling consultants [P_00] and [P_01] as " cut - throat , " senate [P_05] leader [P_05] of rancho cucamonga and [P_07] leader [P_08] of fair oaks said in a letter to davis that the hiring " undermines the assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis .

it leaves several players mseb , successive [P_02] governments , the kirit parikh re - negotiation exercise , the central electricity authority , and other players in new delhi with no clothes on .

asked in court [P_01] there had been no [P_02] , the answer ( believe it or not ) was that mseb was not competent to handle [P_09] .
the cea agrees to this untenable proposition , but later issues a vaguely [P_04] clearance on the basis of a meeting whose minutes were not made available to the [P_09] committee .
what the report shows is that the dabhol contract can be subjected to legal test ( as in fact two members of the [P_07] recommend ) , on [P_09] that it was improperly handled and violative of law and common sense .
for reasons that are [P_01] , mseb and [P_03] chosen not to go down this route .
at the same time , the crisis gripping electricity - [P_03] is showing other states the pitfalls to avoid as they deregulate their grids .
saturday , [P_00] , [P_01] enron corp. of the u.s. , started a procedure to [P_06] power supply contract to the [P_08] , its [P_010] customer , which owes over 3 billion indian [P_013] ( $ [P_014] ) [P_015] .

you also have to keep in mind that ordinary people simply did not read [P_04] until about 500 years ago .
think of it : prior to the invention of the printing press no one had seen such a [P_06] a bible .
but once all the books were selected ( which is another story ! ) and bound into one volume , it was easy to think of [P_08] as a single book - not the library that it is - and that this book had a single author , god .

the heart of spiritual [P_01] about the [P_02] god is right here , right now .

( b ) is addressed to the witness [ presumably the custodian [P_04] when documents are sought]. ( c ) requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and ( d ) is signed by the president of the senate , speaker of the assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired .
contempt power : if the witness does not appear or [P_03] testify or " neglects or [P_05] ... to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books , papers or document [P_011] his possession or under his control , he has committed a [P_015] .
mr. mclain again appeared before the committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point , [P_06] in [P_07] stating : " that , based upon [P_010] in its possession , the said senate interim committee has determined that each of the books , papers , and documents specified [P_018] subpoena [P_019] is material to the matters now under [P_020] the said senate interim committee , and the production of such books , papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the [P_020] of the state [P_020] pursuant to said senate resolution no . 162 . " and " that each of the books , papers and documents specified in said [P_020] duces tecum is material to the matters now [P_020] by the said senate interim committee and that the production of such books , papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee [P_020] perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state [P_020] pursuant to said senate resolution no . 162 .
the court [P_00] found that the order and affidavit were defective because " a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful can not be adjudged guilty of [P_09] unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for .
in cases of constructive [P_01] , as [P_02] , not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the [P_09] facts constituting the offense .
on commentator noted the following with respect to c.c.p. 1987.3 : " the rule limiting [P_05] to california " residents " ( c.c.p. 1989 ) does not apply to a subpoena duces tecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required .
code 1560 ( delivering copies of the records [P_02] affidavit to the court clerk ) ...
the recognition that out - of - state documents are [P_03] to the court 's process is in conformity with the general rule under [P_08] that , absent a statute properly conferring broader powers , the extent of a state 's subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces [P_016] power is coterminous with its borders .
therefore , if a [P_01] is issued which requires the attendance of an out - of - state [P_06] enron , enron has a very good [P_09] that witness is not obligated to attend under c.c.p. [P_012] .
however , if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian [P_05] ( or someone [P_06] ) who is employed by an enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in california , that enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents .
the question is : if the legislative subpoena [P_02] as a " deposition subpoena , " would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat enron as a " party " or as a " non - party " ?
there are three types of " deposition subpoena " : a " testimony only subpoena " ( requires only the attendance and [P_07] the witness ) , a " business records subpoena " ( requires only the production of business records ) and a " records and testimony [P_016] " ( requires both -- also formerly called subpoena duces tecum ) .
c.c.p. 2020(d ) requires that the subpoena be directed to the records " custodian " ( or someone [P_06] certify the records ) .
that procedure extends to records in control of the [P_03] party , not merely in his or her custody .
