according to the accounts of three plant operators , reliant 's operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to [P_07] decrease , then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt etiwanda plant .
this happened as many as four or [P_02] an hour .
the workers and [P_01] authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market .
they and other [P_01] , including aes corp. and a partnership between nrg energy inc. and dynegy inc. , have [P_07] that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging , decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet california 's needs .
frankeny said he was not aware of any [P_02] which reliant schedulers in houston ordered dispatch changes without the iso directing them to do it first .
[P_00] not calling reliant every 10 minutes for that , " said one of the operators .
a computer analysis by [P_01] of shutdown data over a recent 39-day period shows reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of [P_08] .
plants owned by reliant , aes , mirant corp. and duke energy inc. accounted for more than half of the state 's unplanned shutdowns , even though their generating capacity [P_010] more than 25 percent of the state 's total capacity from all sources .
reliant , one [P_01] 's largest and most profitable out - of - [P_04] , reported [P_06] shutdowns during the period in march and april .
reliant 's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 megawatts over the 40-day period , an [P_06] 1,368 per day - enough power for 1.4 million homes for one hour .
[P_00] sources say reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice .
one way to obtain those high prices , the plant workers said , was the simple method of demanding a sky - high price and [P_08] deliver power if that [P_010] not met .
on one occasion , one operator said , reliant ordered a unit at etiwanda to be [P_05] off because the iso would not meet the price of $ 1,000 [P_09] hour , even though the legal price cap at the time was $ 750 .
also , always avoid [P_01] alliteration .

: gore might lose a second round : media suppressed the bush vote 6 chicago sun times : how democrats steal elections 1 court upholds florida vote deadline the [P_09] tuesday , nov. 14 , 2000 ; 1:04 p.m. est tallahassee , fla. --
a florida [P_00] tuesday [P_01] officials may cut off the vote recount in the state 's fiercely [P_06] presidential election at 5 p.m. est .
they believe the [P_01] are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts and recounts until one side achieves the results it seeks .
in fact , [P_01] campaign specifically selected overwhelmingly [P_03] precincts in these counties to recount .
and yesterday , the florida secretary [P_02] reiterated that florida law unambiguously requires every [P_05] board to certify its election returns by 5:00pm today .
that 's [P_00] today secretary james a. baker offered the following common sense proposal to solve the impasse : governor bush has [P_07] to the manual recount .
economics professor tom carroll began running statistical equations thursday on the net gains both gore , who gained more than 2,200 [P_07] , and texas gov. george w. bush , who added about 700 votes , have made in the recount .
with florida 's election results so close , [P_02] voter confusion and intimidation fill the air .
because of the closeness of the race , problems that have [P_03] in the past are difficult [P_06] now .
heavily [P_00] duval county apparently had over 25,000 similarly spoiled ballots .
by prematurely [P_00] gore the winner [P_02] polls had closed in florida 's conservative western panhandle , the media ended up suppressing [P_07] vote .

this is n't the first time that nhtsa [P_02] its mission , argues michael i. krauss , [P_06] at george mason university [P_08] of the recent [P_09] book fire and smoke : government , lawsuits and the [P_013] law .
nhtsa , the agency responsible for minimum fuel economy standards ( found by a court to have likely cost many lives by forcing manufacturers to produce light , dangerous cars ) and for [P_011] - to - disable , baby - killing airbags , does not deserve to be rewarded for its asleep - at - the - switch approach to the tire problem , " krauss wrote recently .
however , when nhtsa fails , self - proclaimed " [P_03] " call for a parallel absurdity : lavishing the agency with more regulatory authority and [P_09] funds .
in this light , perhaps what most needs to be recalled and held [P_04] sloppy workmanship and [P_06] advertising is : the defective regulatory state .

although one " anti - crime " bill ( or " anti - [P_04] " according to its critics ) was recently defeated , another " anti - crime " bill -- this one strengthening asset forfeiture laws -- has just been introduced .
unfortunately , says roberts , asset forfeiture laws [P_02] due process and are any easy way for politicians to look " tough on crime " even though such laws harm [P_010] far more than criminals .
the house judiciary committee led by henry hyde , r - ill . , has documented the most extraordinary [P_06] of the asset forfeiture laws , " [P_09] roberts .
privatization and community [P_01] justice , by bruce benson , at medicare reform :
this [P_00] , which has stalled any genuine reform of medicare , is largely [P_04] of economists , says economist robert b. helms in the new issue of the [P_010] .
my criticism is not directed to [P_02] who have attempted for many years to apply market principles to health - care issues , but to the larger number of economists who have not , " helms [P_012] .
moreover , my criticism pertains to the failure of economists to teach the fundamental principles [P_05] to educated [P_06] , rather than to the failure of ' economics . '
without a concerted effort to impart these principles to a wider audience , helms argues , medicare reform -- and other necessary health - policy reforms -- will become [P_09] political maneuvering , much to [P_012] of the lives and well - being of the [P_015] .

getting him out was n't easy , though , and the process included numerous home remedies , a plumber , two cops , an emergency overnight veterinary clinic , a case of mistaken [P_011] , five hours of panic , and fifteen minutes [P_014] .
bill had just ground up [P_01] of some [P_03] salmon in [P_04] disposal , and when he left the room , rudy ( whom we always did call a pinhead ) had gone in after it .
this is an animal that i have slept with nightly for ten years , who burrows under the covers and purrs against my side , and [P_08] looked like a desperate , fur - covered turkey carcass , set to defrost in the sink while it 's still alive and kicking .
it was also [P_01] to see bill , mr. calm - in - any - emergency , at his wits end , trying to soothe rudy , trying to undo the [P_010] disposal , failing at both , [P_012] freaking out .

the sink was lifted gently out of the countertop , with one guy holding [P_04] disposal ( which contained rudy 's head ) up close to the sink ( which contained rudy 's body ) .

the average price of electricity on the now - [P_03] power exchange soared to $ 120 [P_05] hour in june , [P_07] higher than the same month the previous year , and remained roughly at that level until skyrocketing to $ 377 in december .
the executive director of a san diego consumers group , the [P_03] ' [P_04] , thinks the generators and the marketers of power , using sophisticated computer methods , learned something as the heat wave drove up the demand for power .
the [P_00] iso chairman , who represents generators , cited an iso report attributing the price increase last may to the heat wave , power plant outages , less hydroelectric power and higher prices for the natural gas used by power plants .
[P_00] power prices remained at high levels and even soared last winter , instead of dropping as usual , is more difficult to explain .

although it is not [P_01] or u.s. antitrust law for a firm to [P_05] market power , it is [P_07] do so under the [P_09] act .
the federal energy regulatory commission , or ferc , [P_03] the [P_04] electricity market , is the entity [P_06] enforcing this law .
in [P_00] , congress passed the [P_02] act and required the [P_04] commission ( the predecessor to ferc ) to set " just and reasonable " [P_09] prices .
moreover , if the ferc finds [P_02] electricity prices are [P_03] unreasonable , the [P_05] act gives it wide - ranging discretion to take actions that result in just and reasonable prices .
however , there is no guarantee that market prices meet the just and reasonable standard required by the [P_06] act .
in such a circumstance , the price set by the market satisfies the just and reasonable standard of the [P_06] act . ? ?
in other words , each market participant must submit sworn testimony to the ferc demonstrating it does not have the ability to raise market prices and profit from this [P_09] . ? ?
the events of the past 10 months have demonstrated that [P_03] their filings stating otherwise , all of the out - of - state generators possess significant market power . ? ?
moreover , in its dec. 15 , 2000 report on the california electricity market , the ferc concluded [P_06] electricity [P_07] the summer and autumn of 2000 were [P_010] unreasonable and reflected the exercise of significant market power . ? ?
fortunately for california consumers , the [P_02] and gov. gray davis [P_04] to be accomplices in the ferc 's decision not [P_08] the [P_09] act .
they [P_00] pass on to [P_02] prices that the ferc itself had determined were [P_05] unreasonable . ? ?

and the [P_00] is investigating whether pg & e and edison international , [P_05] southern california edison utility unit is also near insolvency , have improperly transferred cash to [P_010] and to unregulated sister companies . ? ?
southern california edison transferred $ 4.8 billion to its parent company between 1996 and november 2000 , a separate audit showed ; edison international invested $ 2.5 billion in its unregulated mission group subsidiaries during the [P_012] . ? ?

the rest of the united states [P_02] certain to escape rolling blackouts this summer like the ones that have plagued california , but record [P_08] for electricity are likely in many places , energy experts agree . ? ? ?
despite their confidence that they can survive everything but an extremely hot summer without power outages , managers of [P_06] 's interconnecting electrical power grids are anxiously awaiting new power plants that are scheduled to come on - line .
despite all those potential problems , there is [P_02] to believe that california 's power nightmares will spread to the rest of the country , officials said . ? ? ?
apart from california , the worst problems are expected in adjoining western states , as golden state electrical grid managers scramble to [P_07] at a time when power production at the region 's hydroelectric dams is already being cut because of shrinking [P_014] in reservoirs . ? ? ?
assuming normal weather and assuming our generating units come off maintenance on schedule , we do n't anticipate any particular problems meeting our loads , " said bill reinke , [P_010] of the southeastern electricity reliability council . ? ? ?
residents and conservationists are appealing court approval of the generators on environmental [P_04] . ? ? ?
harris cited several reasons " [P_01] we are not [P_03] , " including a decision to centralize all planning , which california did not ; the creation of a regional market instead of a state - based marketplace [P_013] 's , and a policy of only slow , incremental changes in the grid . ? ? ?
but keeping pace with [P_01] 6 percent increase in demand is the addition of 5,470 megawatts of capacity , bulley said . ? ? ?
although no one expects all of that to come on - line , the state 's total generating capacity is just under 34,000 megawatts , meaning that even if only a modest amount of the anticipated [P_012] added , the region would have a cushion , even in a hot summer . ? ? ?

in [P_00] and ' 70s when the geysers got started , there was ' ' a real wildcatter 's [P_06] ' ' among power generators , said rich ferguson , energy chairman for [P_011] california . ? ? '

ferguson said the state spent $ 540 million over the [P_03] years on incentives for renewable energy projects , including geothermal , solar , wind and biomass , and he expects the plan will be renewed when it expires in december . ? ? ' '

[P_00] power prices went up , they could n't pass those increases on to consumers . ? ?

but when we ask how [P_01] came to enjoy [P_03] in the first place , the answer commonly given makes a hash of history . ? ?
meyer lissner , a reform attorney often portrayed as a [P_03] , [P_05] holding of a decisive 1911 citywide straw poll on the subject because he knew most angelenos would cast their [P_012] for municipal ownership .
the most steadfast partisans of [P_01] were not progressive reformers like lissner but the city 's much - maligned labor unions , and for a simple reason .
without organized labor 's dogged campaign for " gas and water socialism , " as well as its willingness to hand control of these resources to the anti - union regimes of mayors george alexander and henry rose , there would be no [P_014] today . ? ?
the aqueduct was the sine qua non of [P_02] .
at a time when most progressive reformers were mute on the subject , [P_04] insisted that the aqueduct be used to generate electricity for the city 's streets , homes and businesses . ? ?
a broad consensus backed the city 's construction of hydroelectric plants while the aqueduct was being built , but most of the city 's politicians and corporate lobbyists were committed to public subsidies , not [P_011] ownership , of aqueduct power .
the 1911 straw poll , in which city voters [P_03] their support for municipal ownership and distribution of owens river power , upset their plans . ? ?
the most consistent [P_01] for [P_01] during the decades after the straw poll were the central labor council , international brotherhood of electrical workers , other [P_09] city employees who [P_010] campaign envelopes , canvassed precincts and got out the vote .
voters who favored municipally [P_01] and initiatives bolstering [P_03] tended to be working class [P_05] ; those opposed were mainly middle and upper class [P_09] . ? ?
in this polarized political climate , mayor alexander called for a $ 6.5-million bond issue to complete the aqueduct - [P_06] network ; he left open the question of who would sell the power to consumers .
wheeler led a successful [P_01] an attempt to split the power - bond issue into two separate ballot propositions , one to complete the aqueduct 's generating stations , the other to create a city - owned distribution system .
such a division would probably have doomed [P_02] . ? ?
the large majority of unionists who favored [P_02] had little time to savor wheeler 's victory .
while pressing [P_00] on the three electric companies , they faced a small but [P_05] split in their own ranks .
dissenters in the building trades council and a few of its unions argued that labor 's grievances against the progressive regimes of 1909 - 14 had turned [P_09] for municipal ownership on its head .
what good was municipal ownership in the hands of a council and mayor who had [P_05] of hundreds of peaceful picketers during the citywide strikes of 1910 , had underpaid aqueduct workers and fed them bad food and had [P_013] unionists influential city jobs ?
on its own , as well as in coalition with other groups , the labor movement marshaled its [P_06] file on behalf of [P_08] .
the pro - bond unions [P_01] win over the dissenting [P_03] ; rather , they overwhelmed it at the polls .

and california in return showered him with buckets [P_02] dollars and electoral [P_04] . ? ?
as [P_00] california is on their mind , administration officials point to the three californians in the cabinet -- ann m. veneman [P_07] , norman y. mineta of transportation and anthony j. principi of veterans affairs -- and others in top [P_014] jobs . ? ?
bush also has appointed california latinos to high - level posts : huntington park councilwoman rosario marin as treasurer , los [P_07] entrepreneur hector v. barreto jr. as head of the small [P_010] san [P_012] supervisor ruben barrales as [P_014] assistant for intergovernmental affairs . ? ?
the proposed agriculture budget , for example , provides only $ 5 million -- not the $ 15 million that california lawmakers said they need -- to fight the glassy winged sharpshooter , an agricultural pest that [P_012] the state 's wine industry . ? ?
his proposed budget includes additional money to crack down on [P_03] drug smuggling and unsafe trucks crossing into california from mexico .
[P_00] , a spokesman for davis , [P_02] and [P_03] " got off to a strong start " by extending federal orders sought by the state to keep power flowing into california . ? ?
in a reference to [P_01] , he added : " they 're skirting around the edges of the problem without taking the [P_07] they need to take . " ? ?
[P_00] are the only ones who can step in and bring some sanity to the cost of electricity in california , " thompson said . ? ?
they said they have responded favorably to all the state 's requests except price controls , which bush [P_06] would discourage the building of power plants . ? ?
randy " duke " cunningham ( r - san diego ) , an advocate of [P_05] , nevertheless said : " i agree with [P_08] that the state alone remains responsible for solving this crisis . " ? ?
" i do n't believe bush should bear the [P_03] responsibility that [P_04] administration left over . " ? ?
tim ransdell , [P_01] of the california institute for federal policy research , doubted that bush would ignore california .

separately , [P_00] approved a plan to control electricity prices in california [P_04] of supply shortages .
just before the release of the first report , the recording industry [P_04] . [P_04] had blunted some of [P_06] by introducing a policy against ads for such albums on [P_010] or in publications whose audience is mostly 16 years old or younger .
gas prices continue upward spiral : the average price of self - serve regular [P_04] spurted higher again in california and around the nation on an increase in demand and a switch by refiners to the more costly summer [P_013] blend required in parts of the country by air - quality regulations .
powell also told broadcasters meeting in las vegas that viacom inc. was likely to prevail in its challenge of federal rules that prevent any broadcaster from owning stations that reach more than 35 % of the nation 's [P_012] viewers . ? ?
ford takes more heat over explorer tires : ford motor co. came under the most direct criticism leveled [P_06] yet regarding last year 's massive firestone tire recall .
two prominent consumer safety groups issued a report saying that the auto maker was largely to [P_05] accidents in which ford explorer sport - utility vehicles , equipped with [P_010] tires , spun out of control after the tires [P_013] treads .
a flight attendant filed a [P_01] the equal employment opportunity commission in los angeles , charging that american airlines discriminated against some employees [P_08] to offer insurance coverage for birth control , pap tests and infertility treatments .
he just did n't believe that [P_02] by power companies could possibly be an important issue ; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee - jerk leftists , who [P_012] capitalists for every problem , be it third - world poverty or high apartment rents .
" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such [P_04] . ? ?
but now a bona fide [P_01] has arrived , whose [P_03] doing terrible damage to our most populous state -- [P_07] will believe it . ? ? ?
and even if there was workable competition in the [P_03] market , prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring billions of dollars from either [P_010] or consumers to the generators . ? ?
the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high [P_07] regardless of the level of demand .
indeed , the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote , with william massey -- the one commissioner who has been [P_07] to calls for [P_08] -- voting against it on the [P_011] it would be ineffectual . ? ?
first , it caps prices only in emergency conditions -- [P_03] fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no emergency .
in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive , in spite of all [P_07] that it is not . ? ?
second , even those emergency price [P_02] full of loopholes , offering extensive opportunities for what mr. wolak calls " megawatt laundering " -- [P_08] to affiliated companies that for [P_010] or another are exempted from the [P_013] ( for example , the controls do not apply to " imports " from neighboring states ) , then selling it back into the california market .
there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there -- indeed , last fall mr. wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts -- but ferc has [P_010] all of them . ? ?
and they 'll be spewing the same pollution - only more so , [P_04] are old , with little or no emissions controls . ? ?
[P_00] trucks and other vehicles , they 've largely [P_03] 30 years of [P_04] restrictions because they were intended only for emergencies , as when a storm or earthquake knocks out power . ? ?
the hot weather that taxes [P_01] and drains electricity supplies also accelerates the conversion of engine exhaust to ozone gas , the ingredient in [P_08] that inflames airways and impairs breathing . ? ?
on those hot days when we want people to [P_03] driving and doing things that pollute the air , the generators will kick in , [P_08] quality will worsen , " salaver said . ? ?
- that 's what it 's like , " said michael scheible , [P_04] of the state [P_06] board , [P_07] engines and fuels . ? ?
in addition , california will be losing one of its largest generators of electricity today [P_05] of two units at the diablo canyon nuclear power plant is taken off - line for 35 days of scheduled refueling . ? ?
small businesses , farmers , manufacturers - all are rushing to buy generators before [P_04] hit . ? ?
the bill , however , was [P_02] by a [P_03] , and environmentalists say air districts have already relaxed their rules enough . ? ?
air board studies , she noted , have found that a person 's lifetime cancer risk increases 50 percent if he or she lives near a big diesel generator [P_09] 250 hours a year . ? ?

[P_00] edison , pg&e split on strategy
dale kasler bee [P_01] body : ? ?
[P_00] was more entrepreneurial , accustomed to the rough - and - tumble of free markets - and apparently believed only a radical remedy would cure its ills . ? ?
we now have two models ; it 'll be interesting to see who recovers the quickest , " said mitch wilk , a former puc [P_08] is now an [P_010] in san francisco . ? ?
both [P_00] afflicted with the same problem : [P_03] costs they were n't able to recover from customers because of a state - mandated rate freeze .
the experience took pg&e out of the cozy world of the regulated monopoly - in which the utility had exclusive rights to its service territory but was subject to state [P_010] - and into the world of competition . ? ?
while the original deregulation called for the cap on customer prices to end in 2002 , davis was [P_06] the utility remain regulated for a decade . ? ?
i believe pg&e was in denial , " davis said in an interview with [P_04] editors and reporters . ? ?
rather , what it wanted - and what davis ' negotiator michael peevey agreed to in principle - was to let the utility charge ratepayers for [P_08] costs of buying [P_010] , said pg&e spokesman ron low . ? ?
that afternoon , davis called pg&e " selfish " and pointedly went into a negotiating session with john bryson , the [P_07] of edison 's parent edison international . ? ?
notably , bryson was president of the puc in the 1970s - when davis was gov. jerry brown 's [P_06] staff . ? ?
politically savvy , edison is one of the utility industry 's biggest contributors to national [P_05] , and it usually spends more than pg&e on california campaigns .
edison international 's board of directors includes los angeles attorney warren christopher , the former u.s. secretary of state and an elder statesman of the [P_08] . ? ?
according to industry consultant barbara barkovich , edison figured , [P_03] wrestle with the federal government over profits when it simply could raise billions through a cash sale ? ? ?

given [P_00] $ 20 billion in power purchase debts that the utilities and the state have accumulated so far , the stubbornly high [P_08] and other data , it 's not unreasonable to project [P_012] in private utility areas will see their rates double , or rise even higher . ? ?
with his popularity waning , davis may be compelled to turn left , shoring up his base by catering to demands of labor unions , environmentalists , trial lawyers and other [P_010] elements of the [P_011] .
here 's a message for pampered and overindulged [P_02] the golden state who [P_04] unceasingly about high energy bills and the day - to - day prospect of rolling blackouts : [P_010] whining . ? ? ?
callenbach 's work was a major influence on the alternative energy policies [P_04] gov. jerry brown . ? ? ?
aside from the energy needs of the industry itself , the wealth it generated encouraged avaricious lifestyles that include power - swilling mansions and freeways clogged with monster [P_09] vehicles . ? ? ?
as we brace for deregulated electric bills courtesy of the [P_03] , imagine what life was like for native [P_07] lived for millennia in a bounteous bay area without microwaves , waffle irons , air conditioning or 24-cubic - foot refrigerators .
but let 's consider the thought that we may actually be better off without the [P_05] appliances whose [P_06] of cords clogs our homes and offices . ? ? ?
smug californians love to point to the state 's ranking as a miserly consumer of energy -- only three other states consume less per capita -- to rebut accusations that we have become [P_011] energy hogs .
potential benefits extend from [P_01] ( a revival of the conservation ethic ) to the curative ( making the state immune to power - problem overloads ) to the liberating ( throwing off for good our dependence on the texas energy overlords ) . ? ? ?

if we get the message , " the net outcome ( of the energy crisis ) will be a quite profound shift in [P_07] in energy conservation , " predicts michael lerner , [P_011] of commonweal , a health and environmental institute in bolinas . ? ? ?
closer to home , one of former gov. george deukmejian 's first [P_04] was to abolish the office of appropriate technology established by gov. jerry brown to move us away from our dependence on non - renewable fossil fuels . ? ? ?
even record high [P_01] have [P_02] to depress the sales of suvs , which now account for the largest share of [P_07] and light truck sales ( 20 percent at last count ) . ? ? ?

[P_00] what 's needed for real policy governor : consumers deserve to get real facts from davis .
and everyone involved in the crisis expects blackouts this summer as demands for power [P_04] and supplies dwindle . ? ?
the davis strategy , if there is one , is to continue the state 's massive power purchases while negotiating longer - term and presumably cheaper supply contracts , encourage conservation , help [P_011] off their debts by selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping ratepayers , and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch . ? ?
meanwhile , the state is spending -- by davis ' own account -- about $ 70 million a day or $ 2-plus billion a month on spot power purchases , paying roughly [P_010] what consumers are [P_012] at the retail level .
he said tuesday that davis , who has maintained secrecy on power purchases , must offer a comprehensive [P_06] plan for dealing with the financial squeeze . ? ?
meanwhile , bankers are sending strong signals that the [P_03] is becoming as poor a lending risk as the utilities . ? ?
davis , for some reason , is unwilling [P_02] this situation the emergency that it is truly becoming -- one that could take a toll of human life if major blackouts [P_010] air [P_011] , respirators and traffic lights .
he insists on issuing his periodic -- and wholly unrealistic -- assurances that things will turn out all right , even [P_07] to reporters this past tuesday that " we think we 'll have this thing licked by the end of fall . " ? ?
part a ; part 1 ; page 19 ; metro desk length : 679 words [P_05] : officials call price stability plan [P_07] ;
two top state energy officials said friday that a federal plan to stabilize electricity prices in california could increase the odds of blackouts this summer and most likely is [P_09] . ? ?
in a [P_00] of complaints attacking the federal energy regulatory commission , the state 's top power regulator and the head of the board overseeing california 's transmission grid said they might challenge the federal order in court . ? ?
the [P_00] approved on a 2 - 1 vote wednesday and released to the [P_05] late thursday . ? ?
we 're going to take whatever actions we can to oppose this to the extent our lawyers tell us it 's [P_07] , " said michael kahn , an attorney named by gov. [P_011] to head the board [P_013] system operator .
in a conference call with reporters , kahn and [P_03] , president of the [P_05] , said the order also seems to indicate that ferc is unwilling to force power sellers to rebate any of the extraordinary profits earned before last october in california 's market , where [P_017] prices began soaring last may. ? ?
and , according to kahn , the federal order [P_03] ties limits on power prices to a requirement that california link its transmission grid with those of other states . ? ?
lynch and kahn said they do not believe it will bring down power costs or help the state avoid blackouts , as [P_07] . ? ?
they 're creating a whole new , wholesale blackout system , " said lynch , referring to a section of the order that allows large customers , such as steel mills and food processors , to get paid [P_012] down when grid operators are struggling to find [P_016] to meet demand . ? ?
though a somewhat similar program has helped california avoid blackouts , the federal order requires [P_05] buyers to name the price to which electricity must rise before they [P_09] customers . ? ?
the requirement of naming a price could lead to more blackouts , said stanford university economist frank wolak , because it prevents [P_07] from paying more if that 's what it takes to keep electricity flowing . ? ?
the proposal by [P_01] rep. [P_01] , the influential [P_03] the house energy [P_05] quality subcommittee , would permit producers of alternative and renewable energy to suspend their contracts with the state 's [P_012] investor - [P_013] and sell their supplies to a third party . ? ?
meanwhile , the utilities would regain their financial footing by selling assets to the state in exchange for being [P_06] recover a portion of their back debt through a surcharge on [P_010] . ? ?
added stephen e. frank , chairman , president [P_02] southern california edison : " releasing them from their contractual obligations will simply exacerbate the problem , because they would then be selling into the market at additionally higher rates and just compound the state 's problems . " ? ?

power supplier to pay state [P_01] :
an energy company accused [P_01] power to drive [P_03] in california 's electricity market agreed to pay $ 8 million in a settlement approved monday by federal energy regulators . ? ?
the settlement is the first by a company accused of charging [P_03] in the state . ? ?
aes , which sells [P_01] generated at its three plants in southern california to williams under a contract , did not share in the profits from the power sales . ? ?
officials at williams have [P_01] the units were [P_03] .
as part of the settlement , the company did not admit [P_03] . ? ?
federal officials had required williams and aes to justify more than $ 40 million [P_04] to the iso .
in a separate matter , williams is one of several [P_03] accused by [P_04] of overcharging the iso $ 124 million for power in january and february .

for the first time in california 's current energy crisis , a power supplier accused of [P_05] the state 's [P_06] market has agreed to return a slice of its profits . ? ?
but williams admitted no [P_01] and ferc specifically stated that it was not finding any [P_05] its rules .
the agreement was promptly [P_01] by state [P_02] williams and other power suppliers have made billions in [P_06] by selling in california 's troubled wholesale market . ? ?
an $ 8 million refund is [P_02] the context of [P_03] rates that these marketers , like williams , have been receiving , " charged carl wood , a member of the [P_011] . ? ?
the broader issue is like somebody walking out of a bank having robbed them of $ 1,000 and the cops [P_06] them at the door and tell them : ' you 're going to have to hand back $ 10 , ' " wood [P_014] .
california authorities had urged the [P_01] $ 33 million in penalties , or [P_05] the $ 11 million in revenue that [P_08] initially estimated williams had made from the two plant [P_012] - downs .
federal [P_00] n't available for comment monday and it was n't clear how the $ 8 million refund was determined . ? ?
she said the $ 8 million would simply be applied against the $ 252 million that williams [P_05] for other energy purchases by the iso and the state 's now - defunct [P_011] . ? ?
in three other cases that do n't involve plant outages , ferc has ordered suppliers to justify [P_05] or refund up to $ 125 million in profits .
in a separate proceeding , state authorities are [P_02] ferc [P_03] williams ' application for permission to [P_06] electricity in california at unregulated [P_08] .
the episode occurred [P_01] prices began to skyrocket statewide last summer .
but because those units were n't subject to the same contract , a ferc statement said the [P_05] forced to pay williams a spot market price of nearly $ 750 [P_010] hour
an aes spokesman said his firm has [P_02] to manipulate plant outages because it has contracted to sell all of [P_07] to williams at a pre - determined rate . ? ?
the energy woes of california and the nation can not be solved with [P_04] or conservation , but only by increasing the country 's supply of oil and natural gas and using more coal and [P_012] , vice [P_013] cheney said monday . ? ?
and the rest [P_01] is starting to wonder when these rolling blackouts might roll over them , " cheney said in a toronto speech to the [P_09] . ? ?
without a clear , coherent energy strategy for the nation , all [P_04] could one day go through what californians are experiencing now , or worse , " warned cheney [P_010] the administration 's high - level energy task force . ? ?
the aim here is efficiency , not austerity , " cheney said , rejecting the notion that [P_05] should be told to " do more with less . " ? ?
conservation may be a sign of personal [P_02] , but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound , comprehensive energy policy , " he said . ? ?
earlier this month , davis approved an $ 850 million energy conservation plan that offers incentives to try to shave at least 2,000 megawatts a day off the state 's [P_010] . ? ?
davis on monday [P_01] bush and cheney for belittling conservation programs . ? ?
although [P_00] approved measures last week designed to [P_03] in the cost of electricity in california , the plan fell [P_07] of hard price caps . ? ?
cheney on monday restated the [P_01] 's opposition to [P_03] , saying they were among a number of the " usual quick fixes " that have [P_09] to solve the problem over the years . ? ?
carl pope , [P_01] of the [P_02] , said [P_03] house is trying to convince people that their plan to ramp up energy production , even at the expense of environmental concerns , is the only way to solve the energy problems . ? ?

federal energy regulators have proposed a surcharge [P_02] electricity sales in california to compensate generating companies , angering state [P_06] say the idea [P_08] consumers . ? ? ?
electric co. [P_00] accrued some $ 6 billion in [P_03] from california 's struggling utilities in late 2000 and early this year , until the state stepped in to take over the purchasing of power . ? ? ?
dianne feinstein , d - calif . , who has been an outspoken [P_04] ferc 's policies in california , said the surcharge would " ensure that power generators get paid fully for [P_011] .
if ( ferc 's ) concern [P_02] policy and maintaining just and reasonable prices for consumers , i do n't quite [P_07] they would get into the middle of a legal wrangle about past bills ' getting paid , " said [P_014] , director of the university of california [P_017] in berkeley .
[P_00] characterized the surcharge as a " [P_02] tax " that underscores the bush administration 's close ties to energy firms , many of which are based in president bush 's home state of texas . ? ? ?
this is [P_00] ferc and the [P_02] more interested in [P_04] energy industry than the consumers or taxpayers [P_07] , " [P_08] , a [P_010] with [P_011] - based foundation [P_013] rights .
it 's back - billing us to pay prices that were [P_03] unreasonable per the ferc 's own analysis . " ? ? ?
ferc 's curt hebert , a mississippi [P_02] whom president bush appointed chairman of the commission , was behind the surcharge proposal , which he told the wall street journal was a way " to stabilize the market .
the surcharge was proposed in ferc 's 39-page " mitigation " plan to alleviate [P_04] prices in california during [P_06] ; the plan was released last week .
i 'm not sure how [P_01] can pass a charge [P_03] costs which then ends up on consumers , without the state saying it 's ok .
the reference to " future [P_01] " is puzzling since , with the state of california picking up the tab , electricity suppliers no longer are accumulating [P_09] from the utilities . ? ? ?
the ferc proposal also implies [P_01] generators have reduced production in california , an allegation the [P_05] themselves [P_06] .

williams co. of tulsa , a major supplier of [P_03] california , yesterday agreed [P_05] $ 8 million to the state to settle an investigation into [P_09] overcharging brought by the federal energy [P_011] . ? ? ?
[P_00] company admitted engaging in [P_01] in agreeing to the settlement , ferc said . ? ? ?
although ferc has directed more than a dozen california electricity suppliers [P_03] $ 124.5 million [P_05] their [P_06] bids to the state , the williams - aes case is
california 's public [P_01] had urged that companies face triple damages if found [P_04] of federal regulations , but ferc said the heavier [P_08] were not warranted . ? ? ?
on different occasions in april and may , the [P_03] the [P_04] not in service and the state 's grid manager , the independent system operator , had to buy power from other aes units [P_013] by the supply contract .

the politics of energy dominated the state [P_02] convention yesterday , as anxious delegates gave a lukewarm reception to [P_06] gov. gray davis , who clashed bitterly with party rival , [P_010] connell .
speaking at the anaheim convention center , where dimmed lights were a constant reminder of yesterday 's stage 2 alert , davis blamed california 's energy woes on [P_09] gov. pete wilson , [P_011] lawmakers and the federal energy regulatory commission , which , he [P_015] , has [P_016] regulate greedy energy firms [P_018] at " out of control prices .

while the order called for a sweeping restructuring of the market to lessen [P_04] price volatility , the commission found it lacked authority to refund money to consumers .

what ferc effectively did was say to california : you guys have to choose between utilities and consumers , " said douglas [P_07] , [P_08] at the [P_09] - based foundation [P_011] rights .
ferc 's proposed order " really passed the buck " and left the puc with clear [P_05] the utilities ' transition costs , said bob finkelstein , a lawyer with the [P_010] network .
although [P_00] rates [P_01] dramatically , sce and pg&e customers are still [P_04] a rate freeze until utilities pay off costs related to " stranded assets " such as nuclear , wind and other noneconomic assets , or until march 2002 .
they say they have [P_01] for refunds but that door is not slammed shut .
but the regulators , though [P_01] power [P_02] this summer were not " just and reasonable , " as required by law , said they did not have the legal authority to demand [P_011] generators , some of whom have made huge profits [P_015] in the california market .

three of the company 's power plants can run only a limited number of hours each year under [P_06] rules designed to reduce [P_08] . ? ?
in a letter to davis ' energy advisors , company vice president john stout proposed that the state not subtract from reliant 's allotted hours whenever its plants are [P_09] run by state grid operators , who buy power on an emergency basis to prevent uncontrolled blackouts . ? ?
earlier this month , the [P_01] buyers paid reliant $ 1,900 [P_04] - hour , several times recent market prices , to avoid blackouts on a hot afternoon .
davis complained publicly , naming the price and the seller -- information that grid operators are supposed to keep confidential [P_06] rules . ? ?
we 're not sure of the [P_02] behind reliant 's proposal , " [P_04] allard , top regulator at the santa barbara county [P_08] control district .
that is possible , allard said , because a 1991 test of the plant 's pollution concluded that it released only one - third as much [P_08] -- a precursor to [P_010] -- as regulators believed when they wrote the permit years ago . ? ?
the proposal , part of an emerging strategy to avert blackouts this summer , is one of several options being advanced by richard sklar , whom gov. davis appointed last month to bring more electricity online with less [P_012] . ? ?
but environmentalists [P_00] quality officials are outraged , calling the plan a recipe for unhealthy air during the smoggiest months in [P_07] 's most polluted state .

each generator spews 500 [P_01] nitrogen dioxide for each megawatt of electricity than a natural - gas fired power plant , according to the state [P_08] board .
only about 550 megawatts could be generated each day , officials say , in a state that requires nearly 100 [P_06] much to function . ? ?
gov. gray davis will issue an [P_02] today requiring that californians be given at least one hour 's notice before blackouts hit , according to a top administration official . ? ? ?

it 's [P_00] and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not pay the generators , " the governor said at a capitol news conference tuesday .

on tuesday , [P_01] leader bill campbell called on puc president loretty lunch to resign .

[P_00] : interview with monica crowley and ellis henican [P_03] :
but democratic [P_00] have been urging mr. lieberman , as the best - placed committee chairman , to dig into the issue , believing further exposure can only embarrass [P_09] mr. bush , whose own ties to enron and mr. lay date back to the president 's race for texas governor .
that is at least partly because the houston company had invested a lot of time and money in washington to keep the government out of its business , and to foster [P_010] support for deregulation of energy and financial industries .
the democrats ' rhetorical line of [P_02] is already clear .

bankruptcies [P_00] to investigate enron by shanon d. murray in washington 01/03/2002
since enron 's bankruptcy filing dec. 2 , the [P_03] committee , the [P_04] , the [P_06] and [P_07] and now the senate governmental [P_010] have launched investigations .
while lieberman said the committee has not decided whether to ask [P_03] or other company executives to testify , [P_07] note that he " would n't consider an investigation [P_011] hearing from them .
several us senators have called for the department of justice to investigate the share dealings of enron corp 's senior executives and to also probe [P_08] an employee pension fund was locked down at a time when executives continued to sell their enron stock holdings as the company 's fortunes dwindled .
thousands of employees of enron have [P_02] jobs , many thousands more have had their retirement savings evaporated .

sen. joseph lieberman , [P_01] the full government [P_03] , did not rule out looking into connections between enron and the administration of george w. bush .

donations of this type reflect certain political realities which are followed by all major corporations , " mr. bennett said yesterday about enron 's us$ 50,000 cheques on nov. 25 and nov. 26 to [P_011] senatorial campaign committee .
enron [P_00] request to order mr. mcmahon 's testimony , [P_03] " unnecessary , unduly burdensome , and disruptive . "
[P_00] recognized that demands for depositions of high - ranking corporate officers are often misused as a tool of [P_07] and should not be allowed unless there is no other source for the same information , " enron said in a motion filed monday seeking [P_015] the request .

but the integrity of the process was criticized almost [P_03] analysts , including professor lynn turner , a [P_06] securities and exchange commission [P_08] accountant and current director of the center for quality financial reporting at [P_012] university .
enron asset holdings , an enron subsidiary that is [P_03] of the energy company 's bankruptcy , owns 47.5 % of the plant , and edison mission energy , a unit of edison international , owns 50 % .
mirant initially disclosed its [P_01] terminate the deal in a dec. 20 press release detailing its effort to beef up its balance sheet .
that 's because enron 's bankruptcy has forced the [P_03] giant to put its power assets up for sale , undercutting efforts by mirant and other companies trying to unload plants and pipelines .

terry hadley , spokesman for the [P_02] , the agency overseeing the electricity marketplace , said electricity retailers were ' ' sharpening their pencils to see what kind of offers they can make . '
this savings is built into the ' ' price to beat , ' ' the state - mandated price per [P_06] that the old utilities will be [P_09] to charge under deregulation to keep their customers .
in california , the [P_01] the wholesale power market while keeping retail prices capped .
this [P_00] state 's two biggest [P_02] to lose billions of dollars [P_04] prices spiked and the retail price caps prevented them from passing the costs along to consumers .
[P_00] , including gov. gray davis , also accused several energy companies , including enron , of manipulating prices and making the state 's problems worse , a charge the companies [P_010] .
the state endured rolling blackouts and other problems before [P_03] ordered restraints on electricity prices last summer .
the [P_00] has been in the spotlight recently because of questions of whether its chairman , max yzaguirre , a [P_07] executive [P_08] gov. [P_09] , [P_010] his connections to the company on state disclosure forms .
thousands of enron employees were left with no nest egg , but it was just one company and there is [P_06] to believe that the off - balance - [P_010] that caused its demise are [P_012] .
part of the reason for the reluctance to enact laws , even in the face of public [P_05] , is the pro - business , anti - regulatory bent of a majority [P_010] congress .

but she has given up the glory trail to become india 's most prominent activist , campaigning against nuclear tests and the dams that [P_08] the homes and li madeleine bunting 07/28/2001
roy is accused of inciting [P_01] and attacking a court official .
[P_00] did the whimsical chronicler of " small things " - the beetles and creeping , [P_05] greenery of kerala - turn to fighting big things such as nuclear [P_09] , dams , the [P_011] and globalisation ?
here , where she [P_01] and spends most of her day , she has none of the small army of servants considered necessary by middle - class delhi .
it 's a sharp [P_01] the vehemence and coruscating wit of her writing .
i like the fact that my rage goes into bigger things , [P_04] small , petty things with people [P_06] , " she says .
and once you 've seen it , keeping quiet , saying [P_03] , becomes [P_04] as speaking out .
the title was misplaced , however , because what then captured her imagination , and has done ever since , was that the biggest mass non - [P_09] movement since indian independence - the campaign against the narmada valley dams - was then on the brink of victory .
like any [P_00] , she wants to understand and tell stories , and dams sum up , like nothing else , the story of modern india : its [P_09] , its wanton [P_010] and its centralisation of power .
it was just a slow , sludging green ribbon lawn that ferried fetid [P_04] to the sea .
bombs and dams are the corollary [P_02] 's slums : the bombs have diverted the taxes , and the dams have deprived millions of their lands and their rivers .
despite the legal cases , and the veiled [P_02] and savage [P_03] the media , [P_05] erstwhile allies , roy is standing her ground .
the end of imagination in 1998 won her many admirers in the west , but in india [P_05] to dent the extraordinary consensus behind the nuclear bomb .
over the next few weeks , police will have to drag people from their homes to prevent suicide [P_06] by drowning : " while the judges are discussing our contempt of court case , people will stand chest - deep in water for days .
in reality , the dams will provide electricity and water for the prospering urban industrial interests of the state - which [P_07] the [P_08] judgment was greeted with jubilation in gujarat 's cities .

that 's [P_00] they could n't forgive her and her mother when she was growing up in kerala , she remembers - they simply were n't as unhappy as a single mother and her " thin , black , clever " daughter should have been .
she describes her friends as " extraordinary people " for dealing with her sudden fame and money , and managing to maintain the " [P_08] nature of our friendships " .
none of them had money before , now she gives hers away , " and i know that it is as sophisticated [P_07] to receive as to give it " .
she has probably made enough from the one novel to live on for the rest of her life ; she eschewed more , [P_07] sell the film rights , [P_010] democratically that six million readers had their own version of the film in [P_014] and she did n't want a single film - maker to replace them all .
the fame has been burdensome , although she [P_02] ( somewhat implausibly , since she had her hair cut , a symbol of rare defiance in a culture that fetishises long hair ) that she has some anonymity in india ( when asked if she is arundhati roy , she says her standard reply is that she wishes she were ) .
the most important thing , she says , is to keep in mind your own insignificance ; she ca n't speak [P_07] issue and do them all [P_09] .
she lambasts the pact of mediocrity to which the vast majority of people subscribe in their marriages , and confesses herself bewildered as [P_07] so many women have children .
it is roy 's passion for writing that stiffened her resolve not to take the lawyers ' advice and apologise to the [P_07] , and she describes a poignantly revealing dream she had before the last hearing :
it is dark when we finish talking , and the apartment block is [P_04] .

the bombings are often covered as " collateral " damage that " happens in [P_04] .

in short , the rojoin complaint as written does not really address the wholesale market other than to [P_06] that acn is acting to take advantage of the " deregulated " electricity market .
bottom line - given the unique fact [P_02] the rojoin case and subject to your confirmation that ees does not have a similar fact pattern , it may make sense to just let the rojoin case alone and not attempt to influence counsel for the defense with respect to removal and focus our efforts on the [P_019] , continental forge and phillip cases .

thursday , february 1 , 2001 | bill to rescue utilities with rate hikes stalls in assembly crisis : plan that would have [P_07] state to issue $ 10 billion in bonds to [P_011] is [P_012] as a " bailout " after the measure barely passes the senate .
gov. gray davis -- who had [P_02] vowed to avoid using rate hikes to resolve the [P_05] -- [P_06] bill as " essential " and said wednesday afternoon that he would sign it if it passed .
wednesday 's debate was marked by rising [P_02] davis from legislators , who have accused him of responding sluggishly to the deepening energy crisis .
before davis ' letter , lawmakers had griped that they did n't know where the governor stood on the bill : " i will not vote for it unless ownership is [P_010] by the governor , " said sen. [P_013] ( d - alameda ) .
no , " [P_01] ( d - san francisco ) said before his house approved the measure with the minimum 27 yes votes required .
and [P_00] charlene zettel ( r - poway ) said the debate on the bill resembled what she had heard about the legislature 's action on energy deregulation four years ago , before she was elected .
clarence brown , a spokesman for edison , denounced as " [P_03] " [P_04] by consumer activists that the utility and [P_07] company , edison international , have profited from california 's ill - starred [P_012] .
it 's [P_00] and it 's not right , " argued battin , who , like all but three [P_06] colleagues , voted against the bill or abstained .
no more talking about leadership , " said campbell , the [P_03] leader .
on [P_00] side , [P_01] began circulating a " manifesto " [P_04] davis take swift actions , including establishment of a [P_07] authority that would take ownership of power plants " in or out of the state .
calling the energy crisis a " condition of extreme peril to the safety " of californians , it asks davis to prepare a plan to protect residential and small business consumers against " [P_011] and unreasonable " rates and immediately convene a meeting of utility creditors to review bankruptcy options facing edison and
using [P_00] centered on the theme " flex your power , " the campaign will urge residents to shift their energy use to periods of the day when demand is low .
as the senate prepared to approve the long - term buying bill , a [P_04] outside the governor 's office led to the [P_07] of two demonstrators accused of obstructing the doorway .
more than a dozen consumer [P_01] yelled " shame , [P_03] , [P_04] " and waved dollar bills as they [P_06] what they called a [P_08] - financed bailout of utilities .
these are multibillion - dollar companies that have the ability to bail themselves out without our help , " said [P_06] , a former green party u.s. senate candidate and one of the protesters arrested .
rather than developing an effective energy policy , bush accused gore of raising gasoline taxes , discouraging domestic production of oil and natural gas , and [P_08] to anticipate the oil and natural - gas price spikes that have occurred this year .

california may be struggling to [P_01] lights on , but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to [P_08] for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices [P_011] .
for instance , mr. [P_01] 's office has gone to san francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against reliant , houston - based dynegy inc. , and southern co. and mirant corp. , both of atlanta , after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential .

fed up with its main customer 's [P_02] pay its bills , the enron corporation 's indian power - generating venture served formal notice on saturday that it would terminate its power supply contract and pull out .

it leaves several players mseb , successive [P_02] governments , the [P_03] re - negotiation exercise , the central electricity authority , and other players in new delhi with no clothes on .

asked in court [P_01] had been no competitive bidding , the answer ( believe it or not ) was that mseb was not competent to handle competitive bidding .
the cea agrees to this untenable proposition , but later issues a vaguely worded clearance on the basis of a meeting whose minutes were not made available to the [P_09] committee .
what the report shows is that the dabhol contract can be subjected to legal test ( as in fact two members of the [P_07] committee recommend ) , on [P_09] that it was improperly handled and violative of law and common sense .
for reasons that are not clear , mseb and [P_03] chosen not to go down this route .

about a dozen suppliers were demanding cash before [P_02] to california due to concerns about the utilities ' solvency , said kellan fluckiger , [P_08] of the independent system operator , keeper of the state 's electrical grid .
he said officials may have to interrupt power to about a million customers wednesday afternoon and then increase the [P_06] cover three million or four million in late afternoon and early evening , when people come home from work and power demand hits a peak .
steve hansen , a spokesman for southern california edison , whose territory includes metropolitan [P_04] but [P_05] city , said the utility had not ordered blackouts by early afternoon .

someone has said that a [P_01] is an evangelical christian who is [P_04] about something .
you also have to keep in mind that ordinary people simply did not read [P_04] until about 500 years ago .

[P_00] power : if the witness does not appear or [P_03] testify or " neglects or [P_05] ... to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books , papers or document [P_011] his possession or under his control , he has committed a contempt .
mr. mclain again appeared before the committee and again [P_03] produce the documents at which point , [P_06] in [P_07] stating : " that , based upon [P_010] in its possession , the said senate interim committee has determined that each of the books , papers , and documents specified in said subpoena [P_019] is material to the matters now under [P_020] the said [P_020] interim committee , and the production of such books , papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said [P_020] interim committee [P_020] perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the [P_020] of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no . 162 . " and " that each of the books , papers and documents specified [P_020] subpoena [P_020] is material to the matters now [P_020] by the said senate interim committee and that the production of such books , papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee [P_020] perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no . 162 .
the [P_00] found that the order and affidavit were defective because " a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful can not be adjudged [P_08] unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for .
in cases of constructive [P_01] , as [P_02] , not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the [P_09] facts constituting the offense .
on commentator noted the following with respect to c.c.p. 1987.3 : " the rule limiting [P_05] to california " residents " ( c.c.p. 1989 ) does not apply to a subpoena duces tecum served on custodians [P_012] unless [P_013] attendance is required .
code 1560 ( delivering copies of the records [P_02] affidavit to the court clerk ) ...
the recognition that out - of - state documents are [P_03] to the court 's process is in conformity with the general rule under [P_08] that , absent a statute properly conferring broader powers , the extent of a state 's subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders .
therefore , if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an out - of - state [P_06] enron , enron has a very good [P_09] that witness is not obligated to attend under c.c.p. 1989 .
however , if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian [P_05] ( or someone [P_06] ) who is employed by an enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in california , that enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents .
the question is : if the legislative subpoena [P_02] as a " deposition subpoena , " would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative [P_08] treat enron as a " party " or as a " non - party " ?
there are three types of " deposition subpoena " : a " testimony only subpoena " ( requires only the attendance and [P_07] the witness ) , a " business records subpoena " ( requires only the production of business records ) and a " records and testimony subpoena " ( requires both -- also formerly called subpoena duces tecum ) .
c.c.p. 2020(d ) requires that the subpoena be directed to the records " custodian " ( or someone [P_06] certify the records ) .
that procedure extends to records in control of the [P_03] party , not merely in his or her custody .
