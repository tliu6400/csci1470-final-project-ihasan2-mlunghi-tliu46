according to the accounts of three plant operators , reliant 's operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to [P_07] decrease , then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt etiwanda plant .
this happened as many as four or [P_02] an hour .
the workers and [P_01] authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market .
they and other [P_01] , including aes corp. and a partnership between nrg energy inc. and dynegy inc. , have [P_07] that [P_07] electricity demand forced them to run aging , decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet california 's needs .

reliant , one of california 's largest and most profitable out - of - [P_04] , reported [P_06] shutdowns during the period in march and april .
[P_00] sources say reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice .
one way to obtain those high prices , the plant workers said , was the simple method of demanding a sky - high price and [P_08] deliver power if that [P_010] not met .
on one occasion , one operator said , reliant ordered a unit at etiwanda to be [P_05] because the iso would not meet the price of $ 1,000 [P_09] hour , even though the legal price cap at the time was $ 750 .

: gore might lose a second round : media suppressed the bush vote 6 chicago sun times : how democrats steal elections 1 court upholds florida vote deadline the [P_09] tuesday , nov. 14 , 2000 ; 1:04 p.m. est tallahassee , fla. --
a florida [P_00] tuesday that state officials may cut off the vote recount in the state 's fiercely [P_06] presidential election at 5 p.m. est .
in fact , [P_01] campaign specifically selected overwhelmingly [P_03] precincts in these counties to recount .
and yesterday , the florida secretary of state reiterated that florida law unambiguously requires every [P_05] board to certify its election returns by 5:00pm today .
that 's [P_00] today secretary james a. baker offered the following [P_03] proposal to solve the impasse : governor bush has [P_07] to the manual recount .
with florida 's election results so close , [P_02] voter confusion and intimidation fill the air .
because of the closeness of the race , problems that have [P_03] in the past are difficult [P_06] now .
heavily [P_00] duval county apparently had over 25,000 similarly spoiled ballots .

this is n't the first time that nhtsa has [P_03] its mission , argues michael i. krauss , [P_06] at george mason university and author of the recent independent institute book fire and smoke : government , lawsuits and the [P_013] law .
nhtsa , the agency responsible for minimum fuel economy standards ( found by a court to have likely cost many lives by forcing manufacturers to produce light , dangerous cars ) and for [P_011] - to - disable , baby - killing airbags , does not deserve to be rewarded for its asleep - at - the - switch approach to the tire problem , " krauss wrote recently .
however , when nhtsa fails , self - proclaimed " [P_03] " call for a parallel absurdity : lavishing the agency with more [P_08] and [P_09] funds .
in this light , perhaps [P_01] needs to be recalled and held [P_04] sloppy workmanship and [P_06] advertising is : the defective regulatory state .

although one " anti - crime " bill ( or " anti - [P_04] " according to its critics ) was recently defeated , another " anti - crime " bill -- this one strengthening asset forfeiture laws -- has just been introduced .
unfortunately , says roberts , asset forfeiture laws [P_02] due process and are any easy way for politicians to look " tough on crime " even though such laws harm [P_010] far more than criminals .
the house judiciary committee led by henry hyde , r - ill . , has documented the most extraordinary [P_06] of the asset forfeiture laws , " [P_09] roberts .
privatization and community in [P_01] , by bruce benson , at medicare reform :
this omission , which has stalled any genuine reform of medicare , is [P_04] of economists , says economist robert b. helms in the new issue of the independent review .
my criticism is not directed to [P_02] who have attempted for many years to apply market principles to health - care issues , but to the larger number of economists who have not , " helms [P_012] .
moreover , my criticism pertains to the failure of economists to teach the fundamental principles [P_05] to educated [P_06] , rather than to the failure of ' economics . '
without a concerted effort to impart these principles to a wider audience , helms argues , medicare reform -- and other necessary health - policy reforms -- will become [P_09] political maneuvering , much to [P_012] of the lives and well - being of the [P_015] .

this is the story of the night my ten - year - old cat , rudy , got [P_06] stuck in the [P_07] disposal .
getting him out was n't easy , though , and the process included numerous home remedies , a plumber , two cops , an emergency overnight veterinary clinic , a case of mistaken identity , five hours of panic , and fifteen minutes [P_014] .
bill had just ground up [P_01] of some [P_03] salmon in the [P_04] disposal , and when he left the room , rudy ( whom we always did call a pinhead ) had gone in after it .
this is an animal that i have slept with nightly for ten years , who burrows under the covers and purrs [P_07] side , and [P_08] looked like a desperate , fur - covered turkey carcass , set to defrost in the sink while it 's still alive and kicking .
it was also [P_01] to see bill , mr. calm - in - any - emergency , at his wits end , trying to soothe rudy , trying to undo [P_010] disposal , [P_011] at both , [P_012] freaking out .
i called the 1 - 800 number for insinkerator ( no response ) , a pest [P_05] service that advertises 24-hour service ( no response ) , an all - night emergency veterinary clinic ( who had no experience in this matter , and so , no advice ) , and finally , in desperation , 911 .
i 'm from the sixties , and even if i am currently a fine upstanding citizen , i had never considered calling the cops and asking them to come to my house , [P_011] .
they were , of course , quite astonished by the situation : " i 've [P_05] anything like this , " [P_07] mike kept saying .
you know , " he said , " i think the reason we ca n't get him out is the angle of [P_07] and body .
the sink was lifted gently out of the countertop , with one guy holding [P_04] disposal ( which contained rudy 's head ) up close to the sink ( which contained rudy 's body ) .
instead , my sweet , gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger , hard , really hard and would n't [P_06] .
the cop , [P_01] not mike , rolled [P_03] window and asked , " [P_05] are you following me ?
once bill and i recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked , led us quickly to the emergency vet , where mike greeted us by holding open the door , exclaiming , " [P_015] you guys ?
[P_00] his temperature ( which [P_02] 10-degrees ) and his oxygen level ( which was half of normal ) , and the vet declared : " this cat is in serious shock .
they laid rudy on a cart , where [P_02] hooked up iv fluids , another put little [P_06] on his paws ( " you 'd be amazed how much heat they lose through their pads , " she said ) , one covered him with [P_015] bottles and a blanket , and another took a blow - dryer to warm up rudy 's now very gunky head .
the fur on [P_01] dried in stiff little spikes , making him look rather pathetically punk as he lay there , limp and motionless .
i told mike he did n't have to stay , but he just stood there , shaking [P_05] .
mr. huskey had somehow inferred that i called [P_02] because i thought bill , my husband , was going into shock , although how he concluded this from my comment that his pads were turning blue , i do n't quite understand .
when i called a tree surgeon about my [P_02] red oak , he asked if i knew the person on that street [P_07] cat had been in the [P_09] disposal .

in recent years , legislators have grown used to the multibillion - dollar windfalls of tax payments , [P_06] them to deliver new swimming pools , school programs , museums , parks , social and health care spending , and tax cuts to their constituents .

they are , [P_01] many observers , exercising their market power to raise wholesale electricity prices . ? ?
although it is not [P_01] or u.s. antitrust law for a firm to [P_05] market power , it is [P_07] to do so under the [P_09] act .
the federal energy regulatory commission , or ferc , [P_03] the california [P_04] market , is the entity [P_06] this law .
in 1935 , congress passed the [P_02] required the [P_04] commission ( the predecessor to ferc ) to set " just and reasonable " [P_09] prices .
moreover , if the ferc finds [P_02] are [P_03] unreasonable , the [P_05] act gives it wide - ranging discretion to take actions that result in just and reasonable prices .
however , there is no guarantee that market prices meet the just and reasonable standard required by the [P_06] act .
in such a circumstance , the price set by the market satisfies the just and reasonable standard of the [P_06] act . ? ?
in other words , each market participant must submit sworn testimony to the ferc demonstrating it does not have the ability to raise market prices and profit from this [P_09] . ? ?
the events of the past 10 months have demonstrated that [P_03] their filings stating otherwise , all of the out - of - [P_08] possess significant market power . ? ?
moreover , in its dec. 15 , 2000 report on the california electricity market , the ferc concluded [P_06] electricity [P_07] the summer and autumn of 2000 were [P_010] unreasonable and reflected the exercise of significant market power . ? ?
fortunately for california consumers , the [P_02] and gov. [P_04] be accomplices in the ferc 's decision not [P_08] the [P_09] act .
they [P_00] to pass on to [P_02] prices that the ferc itself had determined were [P_05] unreasonable . ? ?
it has before it several proposals that would [P_02] all provisions of the [P_04] act .
its owner is not [P_01] : ?
still , such transfers of assets were [P_02] deregulation plans in two dozen states , and they were encouraged by federal rules designed to build a new wholesale marketplace in electricity . ? ?
eight of the nation 's 10 largest [P_02] are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities , controlling about 42 percent of power trading . ? ?
it is largely these unregulated power producers and traders whose sales of power in california have prompted accusations by [P_06] , and demands for the price caps that [P_010] took their first , halting steps toward embracing last week . ? ?
and the [P_00] is investigating whether pg & e and edison international , whose southern california edison utility unit is also near insolvency , have improperly transferred cash to [P_010] and to unregulated sister companies . ? ?
audits have shown that " we [P_02] rules and did n't do [P_04] , " said pg & e 's [P_07] , robert glynn .
mr. glynn said that pg & e had [P_02] that the company has responded to [P_06] department requests for information . ? ?
separately , in 1999 , the utility agreed to pay about $ 29 million to settle [P_05] consumers were endangered because [P_07] to trim trees near high - voltage power lines . ? ?
glynn said the utility had always spent appropriate [P_02] on maintenance , coming within one - half of [P_06] of the amount built into rates over a 20-year period . ? ?

despite all those potential problems , there is [P_02] to believe that california 's power nightmares will spread to the rest of the country , officials said . ? ? ?
apart from california , the worst problems are expected in adjoining [P_03] , as golden state electrical grid managers scramble to buy electricity at a time [P_09] production at the region 's hydroelectric dams is already being cut because of shrinking [P_014] in reservoirs . ? ? ?
residents and conservationists are appealing court approval of the generators on environmental [P_04] . ? ? ?
harris cited several reasons " [P_01] are not [P_03] , " including a decision to centralize all planning , which california did not ; the creation of a regional market instead of a state - based marketplace like california 's , and a policy of only slow , incremental changes in the grid . ? ? ?
but keeping pace with [P_01] 6 percent increase in demand is the addition of 5,470 megawatts of capacity , bulley said . ? ? ?
although no one expects all of that to come on - line , the state 's total generating capacity is just under 34,000 megawatts , meaning that even if only a modest amount of the anticipated [P_012] added , the region would have a cushion , even in a hot summer . ? ? ?

in the [P_00] and ' 70s when the geysers got started , there was ' ' a real wildcatter 's [P_06] ' ' among power generators , said rich ferguson , energy chairman for [P_011] california . ? ? '
it began three years ago , when lake county [P_03] pumping its treated [P_04] water into clear lake . ? ?
now , more than 8 million [P_02] treated waste water is returned daily to [P_05] .
' many of these sites were looked at in the ' 80s , but then [P_05] happened because in the ' 90s natural gas was too cheap to meter , ' ' he said . ? ?

so they sold [P_01] power plants and bought power on the wholesale market , where it was cheap and plentiful . ? ?

the aqueduct was the sine qua non [P_02] power .
a broad consensus backed the city 's construction of hydroelectric plants while the aqueduct was being built , but most of the city 's politicians and corporate lobbyists were committed to [P_010] subsidies , not [P_011] ownership , of aqueduct power .
the 1911 straw poll , in which city voters [P_03] their support for municipal ownership and distribution of owens river power , upset their plans . ? ?
the most consistent [P_01] for [P_01] during the decades after the straw poll were the central labor council , international brotherhood of electrical workers , other [P_09] city employees who stuffed campaign envelopes , canvassed precincts and got out the vote .
voters who favored municipally [P_01] and initiatives bolstering [P_03] tended to be working class [P_05] ; those opposed were mainly middle and upper class [P_09] . ? ?
in this polarized political climate , mayor alexander called for a $ 6.5-million bond issue to complete the aqueduct - [P_06] network ; he left open the question of who would sell the power to consumers .
wheeler led a successful [P_01] an attempt to split the power - bond issue into two separate ballot propositions , one to complete the aqueduct 's generating stations , the other to create a city - owned distribution system .
such a division would probably have doomed [P_02] . ? ?
the large majority of unionists who favored [P_02] had little time to savor wheeler 's victory .
while pressing the [P_01] the three electric companies , they faced a small but [P_05] split in their own ranks .
dissenters in the building trades council and a few of its unions argued that labor 's grievances against the progressive regimes of 1909 - 14 had turned the [P_09] for municipal ownership on its head .
what good was municipal ownership in the hands of a council and mayor who had caused the [P_05] of peaceful picketers during the citywide strikes of 1910 , had underpaid aqueduct workers and fed them bad food and had [P_013] unionists influential city jobs ?
[P_00] not folly to reward labor 's foes with control of the aqueduct 's power ? ? ?

gas prices continue upward spiral : the average price of self - serve regular [P_04] spurted higher again in california and around the nation on an increase in demand and a switch by refiners to the more costly summer [P_013] blend required in parts of the country by air - quality regulations .

a flight attendant filed a [P_01] the equal employment opportunity commission in [P_04] , charging that american airlines discriminated against some employees [P_08] to offer insurance coverage for birth control , pap tests and infertility treatments .
he just did n't believe that [P_02] companies could possibly be an important issue ; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee - jerk leftists , who blame [P_013] capitalists for every problem , be it third - world poverty or high apartment rents .
" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount [P_03] . ? ?
but now a bona fide [P_01] has arrived , whose [P_03] doing terrible damage to our most populous state -- [P_07] will believe it . ? ? ?
and even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring billions of [P_09] either [P_010] or consumers to the generators . ? ?
the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high [P_07] regardless of the level of demand .
indeed , the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote , with william massey -- the one commissioner who has been [P_07] to calls for [P_08] -- voting [P_09] on [P_010] that it would be ineffectual . ? ?
first , it caps prices only in emergency conditions -- [P_03] fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no emergency .
in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive , in spite of all [P_07] that it is not . ? ?
second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes , offering extensive opportunities for what mr. wolak calls " megawatt laundering " -- [P_08] to affiliated companies that for [P_010] or another are exempted from the [P_013] ( for example , the controls do not apply to " imports " from neighboring states ) , then selling it back into the california market .
there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there -- indeed , last fall mr. wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts -- but ferc has [P_010] all of them . ? ?
and they 'll be spewing the same [P_02] - only more so , [P_04] , with little or no emissions controls . ? ?
and unlike trucks and other vehicles , they 've largely escaped 30 years of [P_04] restrictions because they were intended only for emergencies , as when a storm or earthquake knocks out power . ? ?
the hot weather that taxes air [P_02] drains electricity supplies also accelerates the conversion of engine exhaust to ozone gas , the ingredient in [P_08] that inflames airways and impairs breathing . ? ?
on those hot days when we want people [P_02] driving and doing things that pollute the air , the generators will kick in , [P_08] quality will worsen , " salaver said . ? ?

small businesses , farmers , manufacturers - all are [P_03] to buy generators before [P_04] hit . ? ?

[P_00] was more entrepreneurial , accustomed to the rough - and - tumble of free markets - and apparently believed only a radical remedy would cure its ills . ? ?
both [P_00] afflicted with the same problem : [P_03] costs they were n't able to recover from customers because of a state - mandated rate freeze .
both had been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy since january , [P_04] losses depleted their cash reserves and credit . ? ?
the experience took pg&e out of the cozy world of the regulated monopoly - in which the utility had exclusive rights to its service territory but was subject to state [P_010] - and into the world of competition . ? ?
while the original deregulation called for the cap on customer prices to end in 2002 , davis was [P_06] the utility remain regulated for a decade . ? ?
i believe pg&e was in denial , " davis said in an interview with [P_04] editors and reporters . ? ?
rather , what it wanted - and what davis ' negotiator michael peevey agreed to in principle - was to let the utility charge ratepayers for [P_08] costs of buying [P_010] , said pg&e spokesman ron low . ? ?
that afternoon , davis called pg&e " selfish " and pointedly went into a negotiating session with john bryson , the [P_07] of edison 's parent edison international . ? ?
notably , bryson was president of the puc in the 1970s - when davis was gov. jerry brown 's [P_06] of staff . ? ?
edison international 's board of directors includes [P_02] attorney warren christopher , the former u.s. secretary [P_05] and an elder statesman of [P_08] party . ? ?
according to industry consultant barbara barkovich , edison figured , [P_03] wrestle with the federal government over profits when it simply could raise billions through a cash sale ? ? ?

given [P_00] $ 20 billion in power purchase debts that the utilities and the state have accumulated so far , the stubbornly high [P_08] and other data , it 's not unreasonable to project that californians in private utility areas will see their rates double , or rise even higher . ? ?
with his popularity waning , davis may be compelled to turn left , shoring up his base by catering to demands of labor unions , environmentalists , trial lawyers and other [P_010] elements of [P_011] party .
here 's a message for pampered and overindulged [P_02] the golden state who complain unceasingly about high energy bills and the day - to - day prospect of rolling blackouts : [P_010] whining . ? ? ?
callenbach 's work was a major influence on the alternative [P_03] gov. jerry brown . ? ? ?
as we brace for deregulated electric bills courtesy of the [P_03] , imagine what life was like for native [P_07] lived for millennia in a bounteous bay area without microwaves , waffle irons , air conditioning or 24-cubic - foot refrigerators .
but let 's consider the thought that we may actually be better off without the piles of appliances [P_06] of cords clogs our homes and offices . ? ? ?
smug californians love to point to the state 's ranking as a miserly consumer of energy -- [P_05] other states [P_07] less per capita -- to rebut accusations that we have become [P_011] energy hogs .
it puts on the agenda [P_01] debate the fundamental question of whether our energy system should be in the hands of giant utilities or run by municipalities or by the state .
it certainly unveiled the [P_01] of out - of - state energy producers who have sucked billions of [P_06] california . ? ? ?
the crisis has also made us focus on fundamental flaws in our energy grid , such as the 4,500-megawatt [P_06] that emerged in the 1990s while we were all reveling in california 's boom times . ? ? ?
if that happens , gov. gray davis might yet confound critics [P_03] his political prospects are sinking faster than you can say " megawatt . " ? ? ?
these days , the biggest challenge in gathering our daily [P_03] is the hunt for a space in the supermarket parking lot . ? ? ?
if we get the message , " the net outcome ( of the energy crisis ) will be a quite profound shift in [P_07] in energy conservation , " predicts michael lerner , executive director of commonweal , a health and environmental institute in bolinas . ? ? ?
closer to home , one [P_01] gov. george deukmejian 's first acts was to abolish the office of appropriate technology established by gov. jerry brown to move us away from our dependence on non - renewable fossil fuels . ? ? ?
even record high [P_01] have [P_02] to depress the sales of suvs , which now account for the largest share of [P_07] and light truck sales ( 20 percent at last count ) . ? ? ?
the installation now puts surplus electricity back into the energy grid , instead of [P_04] more out of it . ? ? ?
[P_00] what 's needed for real policy governor : consumers deserve to get real facts from davis .
and everyone involved in the crisis expects blackouts this summer as demands for power [P_04] and supplies dwindle . ? ?
the davis strategy , if there is one , is to continue the state 's massive power purchases while negotiating longer - term and presumably cheaper supply contracts , encourage conservation , help utilities pay off their debts by [P_013] intercity transmission system to the state and tapping ratepayers , and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch . ? ?
clearly , davis rushed into the [P_02] just three days after pg&e filed bankruptcy , in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latter action , but its provisions are being labeled a " bailout " by critics .
it places only a token financial burden on edison international while guaranteeing the profitability of [P_05] subsidiary by charging its customers whatever is required to cover its costs and past debts . ? ?
meanwhile , the state is spending -- by davis ' own account -- about $ 70 million a day or $ 2-plus billion a month on spot power purchases , paying roughly [P_010] what consumers are [P_012] at the retail level .
he said tuesday that davis , who has maintained [P_03] on power purchases , must offer a comprehensive [P_06] plan for dealing with the financial squeeze . ? ?
meanwhile , bankers are sending strong signals that the [P_03] is becoming as poor a lending risk as the utilities . ? ?
davis , for some reason , is unwilling to [P_03] this situation the emergency that it is truly becoming -- one that could take a toll of human life if major blackouts [P_010] , respirators and traffic lights .
he insists on issuing his periodic -- and wholly unrealistic -- assurances that things will turn out all right , even [P_07] to reporters this past tuesday that " we think we 'll have this thing licked by the end of fall . " ? ?
part a ; part 1 ; page 19 ; metro desk length : 679 words headline : officials call price stability plan [P_07] ;
two top state energy officials said friday that a federal plan to stabilize electricity prices in california could increase the odds of blackouts this summer and most likely is [P_09] . ? ?
in a [P_00] of complaints attacking the federal energy regulatory commission , the state 's top power regulator and the head of the board overseeing california 's transmission grid said they might challenge the federal order in court . ? ?
the [P_00] approved on a 2 - 1 vote wednesday and released to the public late thursday . ? ?
we 're going to take whatever actions we can to oppose this to the extent our lawyers tell us it 's [P_07] , " said michael kahn , an attorney named by gov. gray davis to head the board [P_013] system operator .
in a conference call with reporters , kahn and [P_03] , president of the [P_05] , said the order also seems to indicate that ferc is unwilling to force [P_011] to rebate any of the extraordinary profits earned before last october in california 's market , where [P_017] prices began [P_018] last may. ? ?
and , according to kahn , the federal order [P_03] ties limits on power prices to a requirement that california link its transmission grid with those of other states . ? ?
lynch and kahn said they do not believe it will bring down power costs or help the state avoid blackouts , as [P_07] . ? ?
they 're creating a whole new , wholesale blackout system , " said lynch , referring to a section of the order that allows large customers , such as steel mills and food processors , to get paid to [P_013] when grid operators are struggling to find [P_016] to meet demand . ? ?
though a somewhat similar program has helped california avoid blackouts , the federal order requires [P_05] buyers to name the price to which electricity must rise before they [P_09] customers . ? ?
lynch said that [P_01] how this aspect of the ferc order unfolds , " it ai n't for washington bureaucrats to decide when the lights go out in california . " ? ?
the proposal by republican rep. joe barton , the influential [P_03] the [P_04] quality subcommittee , would permit producers of alternative and renewable energy to suspend their contracts with the state 's [P_012] investor - owned utilities and sell their supplies to a third party . ? ?
meanwhile , the utilities would regain their financial footing by selling assets to the state in exchange for [P_06] to recover a portion of their back debt through a surcharge on [P_010] . ? ?
added stephen e. frank , chairman , president [P_02] southern california edison : " releasing them from their contractual obligations will simply exacerbate the problem , because they would then be selling into the market at additionally higher rates and just compound the state 's problems . " ? ?
if 3,000 megawatts are made available again , it will have a potentially profound effect on what people pay for [P_06] bolstering overall electricity supplies , " peters said . ? ?
[P_00] only 1,200 megawatts are offline because of payment problems . ? ?

[P_00] new york state sen. al coppola told the group the session should have been titled : " [P_06] from the [P_07] baron utilities . " ? ?
[P_00] backers share three key beliefs : ? ?
they can charge customers less because they do n't have to pay dividends to investors or pay taxes on their sales ; they can respond to local preferences on issues like which customers pay the lowest rates and how blackouts are [P_013] ; and existing utilities will do everything in their power to oppose them . ? ?

soon , a davis confederate ushers four [P_02] 10-gallon hats into an office , shots ring out , and the aide , emerging blood - spattered , delivers the punch - line : " tell the governor his reliant problem is solved .
this is not a power grab , " [P_02] governor says in an interview .
yet in the past six months , pushed by what he calls the " colossal failure " of a [P_06] hatched under his [P_08] predecessor , the governor has put the state deep into the power business .
mr. davis says that the authority is part of what he sees as a " hybrid " system where [P_06] plays an important role augmenting private enterprise in the electricity business .
[P_00] it mean for edison to take over the role [ of buying power ] if the state already has signed all these contracts ? " asks state sen. [P_010] , a [P_011] 's energy committee .
mr. davis has been deeply enmeshed in [P_02] aspect of the electricity mess this year , after having once been relatively aloof from the burgeoning crisis .
under the [P_00] , the state 's investor - owned utilities sold off many of [P_05] plants to other companies and repurchased that electricity through a state - sponsored auction .

when mr. davis could n't get legislative permission to borrow money short - term for power purchases , he signed an [P_07] authorizing the state to borrow up to $ 5 billion from commercial lenders .
in another [P_00] , the governor suspended emission standards for power plants to let them run more hours during the peak - demand periods .
under a law enacted in february , none of [P_03] of billions of dollars of [P_05] purchases or related costs can be challenged as imprudent by the [P_09] commission .
it scares the [P_01] out of me , " says henry [P_03] , a [P_04] puc member [P_05] gov. pete wilson .

enron 's right to the fixed fee [P_02] under the agreement , is contingent upon dpc [P_05] the corresponding ppa fuel management fee by mseb .
as a result , enron has no [P_02] non - payment of the ppa fuel [P_06] to dpc and therefore has no [P_08] mseb under the agreement as there is no breach by mseb of its functions under the agreement .

california 's economy is [P_01] , the state 's tax coffers -- and davis ' own re - election treasury -- are bulging , voters are in a complacent mood , and there have been none of the devastating disasters that plagued the [P_014] the early 1990s .
there is , however , a very dark cloud casting a shadow over davis ' [P_05] : the prospect of rolling blackouts as demand for electric power exceeds supply , accompanied by tremendous increases in californians ' [P_012] .
san diego utility customers [P_01] hard last summer as their local utility emerged from the mandatory rate freeze imposed by the state 's 1996 utility [P_08] .
they enacted legislation rolling back [P_01] temporarily , but leaving it unclear whether ratepayers , taxpayers , san diego gas and electric co. or power suppliers would eventually eat the wholesale costs [P_011] to the spikes .
the two are still operating under the [P_02] , but have acquired at least $ 5 billion in unanticipated wholesale power costs that they want to pass on to their ratepayers .
california politicians have been demonizing the [P_02] , saying [P_03] advantage of the deregulation program 's auction process to drive up costs far beyond reason .
davis ripped into the ferc response during a hearing earlier this month , accusing it of " gutting ( california 's ) ability to [P_08] " and proposing " new and completely untried market rules , making guinea pigs of [P_013] in yet another reckless deregulation experiment . "
the utilities seem to be offering davis a deal : allow them to begin raising rates now to [P_06] " stranded costs " for wholesale power and they will avoid sticker - shock raises in 2002 .
the only certainty is [P_01] ferc reverses itself , davis will remain on the hook for whatever happens -- the sort of unpredictable situation that he [P_09] to encounter .

should the treatment deal with [P_01] the [P_02] ' hatred for the united states , eliminating anti - [P_06] sentiment , correcting the lack of freedom in most middle - eastern countries , refighting the kosovo [P_012] and getting some [P_013] killed , making too many or too few [P_016] foreign human rights violations , eliminating homosexuality and [P_019] in the united states ( as jerry falwell and pat robertson seem to believe ) , altering the capitalist system that prevails in the developed countries , changing the u.s. lifestyles that so infuriate muslim zealots , reducing poverty ?

power supplier to pay state [P_01] :
an energy company accused [P_01] power to drive [P_03] in california 's electricity market agreed to pay $ 8 million in a settlement approved monday by federal energy regulators . ? ?
the settlement is the first by a company accused of charging [P_03] electricity prices in the state . ? ?
the purchases were made in a 10-day period [P_02] and
instead , the company [P_01] $ 750 a megawatt hour for electricity from other aes generating units during that period . ? ?
aes , which sells [P_01] generated at its three plants in southern california to williams under a contract , did not share in the profits from the power sales . ? ?
officials at williams have [P_01] the units were [P_03] .
as part of the settlement , the company did not admit [P_03] . ? ?
federal officials had required williams [P_01] to justify more than $ 40 million [P_04] to the iso .
in a separate matter , williams is one of several [P_03] accused by federal regulators of overcharging the iso $ [P_07] for power in january and february .

for the first time in california 's current energy crisis , a [P_04] accused of [P_05] the state 's [P_06] market has agreed to return a slice of its profits . ? ?
but williams admitted no [P_01] and ferc specifically stated that it was not finding any [P_05] its rules .
the agreement was promptly criticized by [P_02] who [P_03] williams and other [P_04] have made billions in [P_06] by selling in california 's troubled wholesale market . ? ?
an $ 8 million refund [P_01] in the context of [P_03] rates that these marketers , like williams , have been receiving , " charged carl wood , a member of the [P_011] . ? ?
the broader issue is like somebody walking out of a bank having robbed them of $ 1,000 and the cops [P_06] them at the door and tell them : ' you 're going to have to hand back $ 10 , ' " wood [P_014] .
california authorities had urged the [P_01] $ 33 million in penalties , or [P_05] the $ 11 million in revenue [P_08] authorities initially estimated williams had made from the two plant [P_012] - downs .
federal [P_00] n't available for comment monday and it was n't [P_04] the $ 8 million refund was determined . ? ?
she said the $ 8 million would simply be applied against the $ 252 million that williams is [P_06] other energy purchases by the iso and the state 's now - [P_010] power exchange . ? ?
in three other cases that do n't involve plant outages , ferc [P_04] suppliers to justify [P_05] or refund up to $ 125 million in profits .
in a separate proceeding , state authorities are urging ferc [P_03] williams ' application for permission to [P_06] electricity in california at unregulated [P_08] .
the episode occurred [P_01] wholesale power prices began to skyrocket statewide last summer .
but because those units were n't subject to the same contract , a ferc statement said the iso [P_06] to pay williams a spot market price of nearly $ 750 [P_010] hour
the energy woes of california and the nation can not be solved with [P_04] or conservation , but only by increasing the country 's supply of oil and natural gas and using more coal and nuclear power , vice president dick cheney said monday . ? ?
and the rest [P_01] is starting to wonder when these rolling blackouts might roll over them , " cheney said in a toronto speech to the [P_09] . ? ?
without a clear , coherent energy strategy for the nation , [P_03] could one day go through what californians are experiencing now , or worse , " warned cheney who [P_010] administration 's high - level energy task force . ? ?
the aim here is efficiency , not austerity , " [P_03] said , rejecting the [P_05] that [P_05] should be told to " do more with less . " ? ?
conservation may be a sign of personal [P_02] , but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound , comprehensive energy policy , " he said . ? ?
earlier this month , davis approved an $ 850 million energy conservation plan that offers incentives to try to shave at least 2,000 megawatts a day off the state 's [P_010] . ? ?
davis on monday [P_01] bush [P_01] for belittling conservation programs . ? ?
that [P_00] bias , " davis said , referring to bush 's texas oil roots [P_05] 's tenure as the head of
although [P_00] approved measures last week designed to [P_03] the cost of electricity in california , the plan fell [P_07] of hard price caps . ? ?
cheney on monday restated the white house 's opposition to price caps , saying they were among a number of the " usual quick fixes " that [P_09] to solve the problem over the years . ? ?
the [P_00] that fossil fuels supply virtually a hundred percent of our transportation needs and an overwhelming share of our electricity requirements , " he said .
carl pope , [P_01] of [P_02] club , said the [P_04] is trying to convince people that their plan to ramp up energy production , even at the expense of environmental concerns , is the only way to solve the energy problems . ? ?
from the beginning , the administration has wanted to tell the [P_03] that they did n't have any choice , that the only way they could transport themselves to work , heat their houses , toast their toast was to ruin the environment , " he said . ? ?
they 've been out pushing this agenda for a hundred days and the [P_04] are rejecting it , " pope said . ? ?
she joined with more than 30 of her colleagues from california and washington to write to abraham monday and [P_06] handling of the energy crisis . ? ?
federal energy regulators have proposed a surcharge on [P_02] sales in california to compensate generating companies , angering [P_06] the idea amounts to [P_09] consumers . ? ? ?
electric co. [P_00] accrued some $ 6 billion in [P_03] from california 's struggling utilities in late 2000 and early this year , until the state stepped in to take over the purchasing of power . ? ? ?
dianne feinstein , d - calif . , who has been an outspoken [P_04] ferc 's policies in california , said the surcharge would " ensure that power generators [P_010] fully for their [P_011] .
if ( ferc 's ) concern [P_02] policy and maintaining just and reasonable prices for consumers , i do n't quite [P_07] they would get into the middle of a legal wrangle about past bills ' getting paid , " said [P_014] , director of the university of california [P_017] in berkeley .
[P_00] surcharge as a " [P_02] tax " that underscores the bush administration 's close ties to energy firms , many of which are based in president bush 's home state of texas . ? ? ?
this is [P_00] ferc and the [P_02] more interested in [P_04] energy industry than the consumers or taxpayers [P_07] , " [P_08] , a [P_010] with [P_011] angeles - based foundation [P_013] rights .
it 's back - billing us to pay prices that were [P_03] unreasonable per the ferc 's own analysis . " ? ? ?
ferc 's curt hebert , a mississippi [P_02] whom president bush appointed [P_04] the commission , was behind the surcharge proposal , which he told the wall street journal was a way " to stabilize the market .
the surcharge was proposed in ferc 's 39-page " mitigation " plan to alleviate [P_04] prices in california during power emergencies ; the plan was released last week .
i 'm not sure how [P_01] can pass a charge [P_03] costs which then ends up on consumers , without the state saying it 's ok .
the reference to " future [P_01] " is puzzling since , with the state of california picking up the tab , electricity suppliers no longer are accumulating [P_09] from the utilities . ? ? ?
the ferc proposal also implies that electricity generators have reduced production in california , an allegation the [P_05] themselves deny .
his methane project could save the university $ 15,000 annually in electricity costs while simultaneously reducing [P_05] decreasing odors . ? ?

agricultural projects in tulare and kings counties have been [P_03] after neighbors lobbied against odors they anticipated from farms , he said . ? ?
williams co. of tulsa , a major supplier of electricity to california , yesterday agreed to refund $ 8 million to the state to settle an investigation into [P_09] overcharging brought by the federal energy regulatory commission . ? ? ?
[P_00] company admitted engaging in [P_01] in agreeing to the settlement , ferc said . ? ? ?
although ferc has directed more than a dozen california electricity suppliers to refund $ 124.5 million or justify their [P_06] bids to the state , the williams - aes case is
the only enforcement action ferc has brought so far involving california 's extraordinary wholesale [P_04] . ? ? ?
california 's [P_00] commission had urged that companies face triple damages if found [P_04] of federal regulations , but ferc said the heavier sanctions were not warranted . ? ? ?
williams received a fee for this service and was also entitled to be reimbursed for plant operating costs at an hourly rate of about $ 63 [P_08] . ? ? ?
on different occasions in april and may , the [P_03] the [P_04] not in service and the state 's grid manager , the independent system operator , had to buy power from other aes units not covered by the supply contract .

[P_00] that supplies are ample is because natural gas inventories are now higher than usual .
these newspaper stories then go on to tell us that one of the [P_04] for the drop in demand has been unseasonably cool weather .
unfortunately , most people missed the qualifications in the midst of the panic and braced themselves for a storm that [P_06] sited in the first place .
when [P_00] went up this spring , people bought less [P_03] .
[P_00] of the story is that markets are n't " broke " when prices spike .
but [P_00] how unpleasant price spikes are in the short term , they 're [P_05] to remedy the underlying economic problems .
while it 's [P_01] that liberals find such market success stories a constant revelation , the real surprise is that the ostensibly " hard - right " [P_09] had such little faith in a free - market system it 's constantly [P_014] .
those issues revolved around pg&e being the [P_02] confirming party , and default language being tied to specific canadian driven pricing points .

shippers [P_00] northwest 's must - flow ofos several northern nevada industrial gas users have accused northwest pipeline of [P_06] by holding them [P_08] to the daily must - flow operational flow orders ( ofos ) that it has issued since early december in an effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system .
in a section 5 complaint filed friday , the industrial gas customers called on ferc to direct northwest to " [P_06] desist " the [P_08] the tariff , which [P_010] is forcing them and other customers at the northern end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs of customers on the southern end of northwest 's system .
nevertheless , the pipeline 's daily must - flow ofos " have forced them into the volatile daily gas market to avoid extremely high non - compliance penalties , [P_09] their business decisions to rely on alternative fuels , " they told ferc [ rp01 - 189].
if one of the nevada [P_01] , newmont mining corp. , had defied northwest 's order to flow 25 % of its contract demand , or 1,000/dth , on any december day , it would have been penalized $ 58,160 for that one day , they said .
if all of the nevada industrial customers had [P_02] the pipeline 's order , the one - day penalty would have been $ 149,471 .
that 's because it requires one group of shippers , who see no additional benefits , to incur gas acquisition and transportation costs [P_07] subsidize service to another group of shippers , they argued .

jones)- state regulators and legislators should re - regulate deregulated power markets after [P_04] left california consumers in the lurch , public citizen said friday .

ferc 's inability to [P_01] from [P_02] reveals that [P_04] deregulation has created unregulated monopolies and cartels that are free to fleece consumers for billions without fear of retribution , " higley said .
public citizen also called for the u.s. [P_02] department to launch [P_03] " to determine who is responsible for the [P_07] california ratepayers by [P_09] power suppliers .
the u.s. federal energy regulatory commission wednesday issued an order in response to chronic power - supply problems in california that have sent [P_07] prices soaring .
while the order called for a sweeping restructuring of the market to lessen [P_04] price volatility , the commission found it lacked authority to refund money to consumers .
clearly federal legislative action is necessary because [P_02] n't take the authority i think it has , " said rep. bob filner , r - calif .

i 've never known a federal agency to override a state legislature like that , " bilbray said , accusing ferc of shrugging its shoulders by recognizing that market [P_09] occurred , but blaming the state lawmakers for it .
ferc 's pointing the fingers at the state and not the [P_03] , " he said .

but ferc said it found no [P_02] specific market [P_03] and that it lacked the [P_05] to order refunds of federallysanctioned wholesale rates in the absence of market - power evidence .
what ferc effectively did was say to california : you guys have to choose between utilities and consumers , " said douglas [P_07] , [P_08] at the santa monica - based foundation [P_011] rights .
ferc 's proposed order " really passed the buck " and left the puc with clear [P_05] the utilities ' transition costs , said bob finkelstein , a lawyer with the [P_010] network .
although [P_00] rates [P_01] dramatically , sce and pg&e customers are still [P_04] a [P_05] until utilities pay off costs related to " stranded assets " such as nuclear , wind and other noneconomic assets , or until march 2002 .
they say they have [P_01] for [P_02] that door is not slammed shut .
but the regulators , though declaring power [P_02] this summer were not " just and reasonable , " as required by law , said they did not have the [P_010] to demand [P_011] generators , some of whom have made huge profits [P_015] in the california market .

we 're not sure of [P_01] behind reliant 's proposal , " [P_04] allard , top regulator at the santa barbara county [P_08] control district .
that is possible , allard said , because a 1991 test of the plant 's [P_05] concluded that it released only one - third as much [P_08] -- a [P_010] to [P_010] -- as regulators believed when they wrote the permit years ago . ? ?
the proposal , part of an emerging strategy to avert blackouts this summer , is one of several options being advanced by richard sklar , whom gov. davis appointed last month to bring more electricity online with less [P_012] . ? ?

nitrogen [P_00] contributes to ozone and microscopic airborne particles , two abundant air pollutants . ? ?
only about 550 megawatts could be generated each day , officials say , in a state that requires nearly 100 [P_06] much to function . ? ?
gov. gray davis will issue an [P_02] today requiring [P_03] be given at least one hour 's notice before blackouts hit , according to a top administration official . ? ? ?

davis ' ratings have gone down , but a lot of others are given lower ratings " when people are asked to [P_07] how the [P_08] institutions are handling the state 's energy situation , said mark dicamillo , director of the field poll . ? ? ?
growing worries about the [P_01] the [P_02] have sent ratings skidding for anyone connected with the energy business . ? ? ?
to the extent [P_01] officials are seen as not bending on that issue , " he said , " i suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather dismal . " ? ? ?
the field poll [P_01] graphic ? ?
the proposal , one of several options the governor is considering , would pay for diesel power - which at its dirtiest is 500 [P_08] polluting than the cleanest natural gas power plants - when electricity supplies are stretched . ? ?

here , where she [P_01] and spends most of her day , she has none of the small army of servants considered necessary by middle - class delhi .
and once you 've seen it , keeping quiet , saying nothing , becomes [P_04] as speaking out .
the title was misplaced , however , because what then captured her imagination , and has done ever since , was that the biggest mass non - [P_09] movement since indian [P_010] - the campaign against the narmada valley dams - was then on the brink of victory .
like any [P_00] , she wants to understand and tell stories , and dams sum up , like [P_06] else , the story of modern india : its [P_09] , its wanton [P_010] and its centralisation of power .
it was just a slow , sludging green ribbon lawn that ferried fetid [P_04] to the sea .
bombs and dams are the corollary of india 's slums : the [P_04] have diverted the taxes , and the dams have deprived millions of their lands and their [P_09] .

she has probably made enough from the one novel to live on for the rest of her life ; she eschewed more , [P_07] sell the film rights , arguing democratically that six million readers had their own version of the film in [P_014] and she did n't want a single film - maker to replace them all .
the fame has been burdensome , although she [P_02] ( somewhat implausibly , since she had her hair cut , a [P_07] of rare defiance in a culture that fetishises long hair ) that she has some anonymity in india ( when asked if she is arundhati roy , she says her standard reply is that she wishes she were ) .
the most important thing , she says , is to keep in mind your own insignificance ; she ca n't speak [P_07] issue and do them all justice .

rappers for america london 's guardian reports that rap music -- once a genre whose politics [P_05] mostly of violent opposition to authority -- has become patriotic in the wake of sept. 11 .
they announced that anybody wearing the flag , which they described as " [P_04] gang colours " , would not be admitted to their shows .
crucially , though , the coup and the handful of other anti - [P_04] rappers sell relatively little , and to a predominately white , [P_08] fanbase , a sub - genre known as backpacker hip - hop .
when i see [P_01] flag flying , it 's a [P_03] .

she 's [P_00] journalists who think [P_02] would tell [P_03] , but she 's all for dubious sources -- as long as they 're anti - american :
a careful reading [P_01] finds repeated [P_02] which dozens , even hundreds , of civilians have been killed by u.s. bombs .
the bombings are often covered as " collateral " damage that " happens in [P_04] .
other times , pentagon denials coming out [P_02] are given equal credibility with eyewitness reports from anti - taliban villagers on the ground ; the story dissolves into a [P_010] balance of he - said , she - said .
unlike in europe , the u.s. press [P_02] focuses on the growing rage over [P_04] falling on civilians .
but how else do we explain that , in early december , the british journalist robert fisk was nearly beaten to death by bombed - out afghan [P_09] just inside [P_010] border ?
* * the new hampshire " study " she cites is pure [P_04] science ; it bases its conclusions on such sources of " information " as the pro - islamist al - jazeera news network .
as for fisk , she accepts at face value this notoriously anti - american [P_04] 's ideologically self - serving interpretation of his beating , which , as we noted , sounded to us like a simple robbery attempt .
* * quote * * * minus the torture , the united states is now doing [P_05] arab regimes have been doing for decades : arresting their [P_09] " islamist " [P_010] , holding them incommunicado , chained and hooded , while preparing [P_014] trials .

there is no need to quantify the [P_02] the [P_03] papers under singapore and english law . , but can only assume that the same is true under malaysian law ( which for most part follow english law ) .

in essence , plaintiffs [P_01] in rojoin that they were offered electricity at 3.4 cents per kwh when in fact the true charges to [P_08] turned out to be about 15 cents per kwh .
one of [P_00] is that plaintiffs were [P_02] of the " sneaky way that the fees are recalculated .
in short , the rojoin complaint as written does not really address the wholesale market other than to [P_06] that acn is acting to take advantage of the " deregulated " electricity market .
bottom line - given the unique fact pattern of the rojoin case and subject to your confirmation that ees does not have a similar fact pattern , it may make sense to just let the rojoin case alone and not attempt to influence counsel for the defense with respect to [P_016] and focus our efforts on the berg , continental forge and phillip cases .

what the report shows is that the dabhol contract can be subjected to legal test ( as in fact two members of the godbole committee recommend ) , on [P_09] that it was improperly handled and violative of law and common sense .
for reasons that are [P_01] , mseb and [P_03] chosen not to go down this route .

( b ) is addressed to the witness [ presumably the custodian [P_04] when documents are sought]. ( c ) requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and ( d ) is signed by the president of the senate , speaker of the assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired .
[P_00] power : if the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or " neglects or refuses ... to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books , papers or document [P_011] his possession or under his control , he has committed a [P_015] .
mr. mclain again appeared before the committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point , [P_06] in [P_07] stating : " that , based upon evidence in its possession , the said [P_013] interim committee has determined that each of the books , papers , and documents specified [P_018] subpoena duces [P_019] is material to the matters now [P_020] by the said [P_020] interim committee , and the production of such books , papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state [P_020] pursuant to said senate resolution no . 162 . " and " that each of the books , papers and documents specified [P_020] subpoena duces [P_020] is material to the matters now [P_020] by the said senate interim committee and that the production of such books , papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee [P_020] perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the [P_020] of the state of california pursuant to said [P_020] resolution no . 162 .
the [P_00] found that the order and affidavit were defective because " a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful can not be adjudged [P_08] unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for .
in cases of constructive [P_01] , as [P_02] , not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the [P_09] facts constituting the offense .
on commentator noted the following with respect to c.c.p. 1987.3 : " the rule limiting [P_05] to california " residents " ( c.c.p. 1989 ) does not apply to a subpoena duces tecum served on custodians of records unless [P_013] attendance is required .
code 1560 ( delivering copies of the records [P_02] affidavit to the court clerk ) ...
the recognition that out - of - state documents are [P_03] to the court 's process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that , absent a statute properly conferring broader powers , the extent of a state 's subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces [P_016] power is coterminous with its borders .
therefore , if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an out - of - state [P_06] enron , enron has a very good [P_09] that witness is not obligated to attend under c.c.p. 1989 .
however , if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian [P_05] ( or someone similarly situated ) who is employed by an enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in california , that enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents .
the [P_00] : if the legislative subpoena [P_02] as a " deposition subpoena , " would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat enron as a " party " or as a " non - party " ?
there are three types of " deposition subpoena " : a " testimony only subpoena " ( requires only the attendance and [P_07] the witness ) , a " business records subpoena " ( requires only the production of business records ) and a " records and testimony subpoena " ( requires both -- also formerly called subpoena [P_019] ) .
c.c.p. 2020(d ) requires that the [P_02] be directed to the records " custodian " ( or someone [P_06] certify the records ) .
that procedure extends to records in control of the [P_03] party , not [P_04] in his or her custody .
