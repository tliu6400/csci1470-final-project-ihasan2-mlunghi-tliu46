[P_00] is that enron seeks a continuing representation that ( i ) all transactions have the appropriate approval , waiving any defense of lack of authority , ( ii ) there is no [P_034] ( [P_037] left out of thelanguage ) defense to any transaction , ( iii ) payment for the gas will be first in the flow of funds , and ( iv ) the obligations are [P_072] [P_074] restrictions or [P_078] funds restrictions of the texas [P_085] , [P_087] or cps constituency documents .

despite promises to [P_03] -- common theme in this exercise -- burton ( as i understand ) did not remove the condemnation ( [P_024] ? )
i understood the tactic to be -- get a prospective , date certain end to [P_015] in the bill , which then gives us very firm legal ground on which to seek and get the money owed to us .

there is a mistake on page 5 regarding the percentage top that needs to pass outside [P_016] dispatch ( it 's 75 % rather than 78 % ) .
the " catch " is in two places : first , whether dispatch [P_013] power meets the test ( shubh told me recently it did -- does this continue to hold true , [P_034] ? ) , and second , the recovery of the power purchase costs due to the variance ( the difference between what [P_057] in the order and what [P_064] dispatched . )
thus , i have a query : let 's assume that the merc does not [P_015] to determine least cost purchases or [P_023] dispatch or to determine a blend of the two .
[P_00] - my gut feel is that there will not be a 75 % despatch on all three blocks .

according to the accounts of three plant operators , reliant 's operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to [P_021] decrease , then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt etiwanda plant .
[P_00] as many as four or [P_07] an hour .
the workers and [P_03] authorities [P_06] the swings [P_09] of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market .
they and other [P_03] , including aes corp. and a partnership between nrg energy inc. and dynegy inc. , have [P_021] that [P_023] electricity demand [P_026] to run aging , decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet california 's needs .
while acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as [P_011] every 10 minutes , company officials said it was done at the instructions of the iso to maintain supply - demand balance .
frankeny said he was not aware of any [P_08] which reliant schedulers in houston ordered dispatch changes without the iso directing them to do it first .

reliant , one [P_03] 's largest and most profitable out - of - [P_014] , reported [P_018] shutdowns during the period in march and april .

but the operators said the issue is not [P_08] - cut .
[P_00] sources say reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice .
one way to obtain those high prices , the plant workers said , was the simple method of demanding a sky - high price and [P_025] deliver power if that [P_031] not met .
on one occasion , one [P_05] , reliant ordered a unit at etiwanda to [P_015] off because the iso would not meet the price of $ 1,000 [P_029] hour , even though the legal [P_037] at the time was $ 750 .

for example , cellular phone fees of cellular phone companies [P_010] to [P_013] by its local phone company as a separate line item and are not included in its gross receipts .

we reviewed the documentation used by the [P_07] reviewed the legal and tax issues with outside counsel and our tax advisors and came to the conclusion that the methodology used by this marketer is [P_035] sufficient to avoid the tax liability .
such operational netting does not change [P_06] that [P_09] the marketer is deemed to have received the full gross amount from [P_022] even if they did not physically receive the invoiced amounts .

in fact , [P_03] campaign specifically selected overwhelmingly [P_09] precincts in these counties to [P_015] .
and yesterday , the florida [P_05] state reiterated that florida law unambiguously requires every [P_015] board to certify its election returns by 5:00pm today .
that 's [P_02] today secretary james a. baker offered the following [P_011] proposal to solve the impasse : governor bush has [P_022] the [P_025] .
economics professor tom carroll began running statistical equations thursday on the net gains both gore , [P_016] more than 2,200 [P_021] , and texas gov. george w. bush , who added about 700 [P_034] , have made in [P_039] .
with florida 's election results so close , [P_08] voter confusion and intimidation fill the air .
because of the closeness of the race , problems that have been [P_012] the past are difficult [P_018] now .

this is n't the first time that nhtsa [P_08] its mission , argues michael i. krauss , [P_018] at george mason university [P_024] of the recent [P_029] book fire and smoke : government , lawsuits and [P_040] of law .
nhtsa , the agency responsible for minimum fuel economy standards ( found by a court to have likely cost many lives [P_021] manufacturers to produce light , dangerous cars ) and for [P_033] - to - disable , baby - killing airbags , does not deserve to be rewarded for its [P_052] - at - the - switch approach to the tire problem , " krauss wrote recently .
however , when nhtsa fails , self - proclaimed " [P_010] " call for a parallel absurdity : lavishing the agency with more [P_024] and [P_027] funds .
in this light , perhaps [P_05] needs to be recalled and [P_012] for sloppy workmanship and [P_018] [P_019] : the defective regulatory state .

bill had just ground up [P_05] of some [P_09] salmon in [P_012] disposal , and when he left the room , rudy ( whom we always did call a pinhead ) had gone in after it .
this is an animal that i have slept with nightly for ten years , who burrows under the covers and purrs [P_021] side , and [P_026] looked like a desperate , fur - covered turkey carcass , set to defrost in the sink while it 's still alive and kicking .
it was also [P_03] to see bill , mr. calm - in - any - emergency , at his wits end , trying to soothe rudy , trying to undo [P_030] disposal , [P_034] at both , [P_038] freaking out .
i called the 1 - 800 number for insinkerator ( no response ) , a pest [P_016] service that advertises 24-hour service ( no response ) , an all - night emergency veterinary clinic ( [P_035] no experience in this matter , and so , no advice ) , and finally , in desperation , [P_056] .
i 'm from the sixties , and even if i am currently a fine upstanding citizen , i had never considered calling [P_022] and asking them to come to my house , [P_033] .
they were , of course , quite astonished by the situation : " i 've [P_015] anything like this , " [P_022] mike kept saying .
you know , " he said , " i think the reason we ca n't get him out is the angle of [P_022] and body .
the sink was lifted gently out of the countertop , with one guy holding [P_014] disposal ( which contained rudy 's head ) up close to the sink ( which contained rudy 's body ) .
instead , my sweet , gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger , hard , really hard and would n't [P_020] .
the cop , [P_03] [P_05] , rolled [P_09] window and asked , " [P_016] are you following me ?
once bill and i recovered from our shock at having tailed [P_011] cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked , led us quickly to the emergency vet , where mike greeted us by holding open the door , exclaiming , " [P_046] you guys ?
[P_00] his temperature ( which [P_06] 10-degrees ) and his oxygen level ( which was half of normal ) , and the vet [P_025] : " this cat is in serious shock .
they laid rudy on a cart , where [P_08] hooked up iv [P_013] , another put little [P_018] on his paws ( " you 'd be amazed how much heat they lose through their pads , " she said ) , one covered him with [P_046] bottles and a blanket , and another took a blow - dryer to warm up rudy 's now very gunky head .
the fur on [P_03] dried in stiff little spikes , making him look rather pathetically punk as he lay there , limp and motionless .
i told mike [P_03] n't have to stay , but he just stood there , shaking [P_017] .
mr. huskey had somehow inferred that i called [P_08] because i thought bill , my husband , was going into shock , although how he concluded this from my comment that his pads were turning blue , i do n't quite understand .
when i called a tree surgeon about my [P_08] red oak , he asked if i knew the person on that street [P_022] cat had been in [P_027] disposal .
and when i went to get my hair cut , the shampoo person told me the [P_016] story her grandma had read in the paper , about a cat that got stuck in [P_033] disposal .

although it is not [P_04] [P_05] or u.s. antitrust law for a firm to [P_015] market power , it is [P_022] do so under the [P_028] act .
the federal [P_02] commission , or ferc , [P_09] the [P_012] electricity market , is the entity [P_020] [P_022] this law .
in [P_01] , congress passed the [P_06] [P_08] required the [P_012] commission ( the predecessor to ferc ) to set " [P_024] reasonable " [P_028] prices .
moreover , if the ferc finds [P_06] [P_08] are [P_011] unreasonable , the [P_016] act [P_019] wide - ranging discretion to take actions that result in [P_031] reasonable prices .
however , there is no guarantee that market prices meet the [P_011] reasonable standard required by the [P_018] act .
in such a circumstance , the price set by the market satisfies the [P_013] reasonable [P_016] the [P_019] act . ? ?
in other words , each market participant must submit sworn testimony to the ferc demonstrating it does not have the ability to raise market prices and profit from this [P_029] . ? ?
the events of the past 10 months have demonstrated that [P_010] their filings stating otherwise , all of the out - of - [P_024] possess significant market power . ? ?
moreover , in its dec. 15 , 2000 report on the california electricity market , the ferc concluded [P_018] [P_020] during the summer and autumn of 2000 were [P_030] unreasonable and [P_034] [P_036] significant market power . ? ?
fortunately for [P_02] , the [P_06] [P_08] and gov. [P_012] [P_014] be accomplices in the ferc 's decision not [P_024] the [P_027] act .
they [P_01] pass on to [P_06] prices that the ferc itself had determined were [P_016] unreasonable . ? ?
it has before it several proposals that would [P_08] all provisions of the [P_013] act .
its owner is not [P_04] : ?
still , such transfers of assets were [P_07] deregulation plans in two dozen states , and they were encouraged [P_020] rules designed to build a new wholesale marketplace in electricity . ? ?
and today , the offspring of [P_06] 's utilities dominate that market , after industry leader enron . ?
eight of [P_02] 's [P_05] [P_07] are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities , controlling about 42 percent of power trading . ? ?
it is largely these [P_04] producers and traders [P_09] sales of power in california have prompted accusations by [P_019] [P_021] [P_023] , [P_025] for the [P_029] [P_031] regulators took their first , [P_038] steps toward embracing last week . ? ?

and the [P_02] [P_04] [P_06] whether pg & e and edison international , [P_016] southern california [P_019] unit is also near insolvency , have [P_028] transferred cash to their parents and to unregulated sister companies . ? ?
southern california edison transferred $ 4.8 billion to [P_08] company between 1996 and november 2000 , a separate audit showed ; edison international invested $ 2.5 billion in its unregulated mission group subsidiaries during the [P_036] . ? ?
audits have shown that " we [P_06] rules and did n't do [P_013] , " said pg & e 's [P_022] , [P_025] .
mr. glynn said that pg & e had [P_08] [P_010] that the company has responded to [P_018] requests for information . ? ?

the rest of the united states [P_06] certain to escape rolling blackouts this summer like the ones that have plagued california , but record [P_025] for electricity are likely in many places , energy experts agree . ? ? ?
despite their confidence that they can survive everything but an extremely hot summer without power outages , managers of [P_019] 's interconnecting electrical power grids are anxiously awaiting new power plants that are scheduled to come on - line .
they are also promoting more frugal consumption [P_07] customers and seeking ways to avoid distribution logjams during peak demand periods this summer . ? ? ?
that leaves parts of [P_04] vulnerable to outages if there are prolonged heat waves this summer , or if utilities are unable to start up new or rebuilt gas - fired power plants as scheduled , according to energy experts . ? ? ?
despite all those potential problems , there is [P_08] to believe that california 's power nightmares will spread to the rest of the country , officials said . ? ? ?
california , in a sense , has [P_07] as a stalking horse for other states , some of which also deregulated [P_022] systems and are consciously avoiding doing anything that resembles the california model . ? ? ?
apart from california , the worst problems are expected in adjoining [P_011] , as golden state electrical grid managers scramble to [P_022] at a time [P_027] production at the region 's hydroelectric dams is already [P_038] because of shrinking [P_043] in reservoirs . ? ? ?
but in interviews , officials of many of the 10 regional [P_011] that comprise the national grid system appeared fairly sanguine about the prospect of avoiding widespread brownouts this summer . ? ? ?
assuming normal weather and assuming our generating units come off maintenance on schedule , we do n't anticipate any particular problems meeting our loads , " said bill reinke , [P_030] of the southeastern electricity reliability council . ? ? ?
residents and conservationists are appealing court approval of the generators on environmental [P_012] . ? ? ?
harris cited several reasons " [P_05] are not like california , " including a decision [P_016] all planning , [P_021] did not ; the creation of a regional market instead of a state - based marketplace like california 's , and a policy of only slow , incremental changes in the grid . ? ? ?
but keeping [P_02] [P_04] 6 percent increase in demand is the addition of 5,470 megawatts of capacity , bulley said . ? ? ?
although no one expects all of that to come on - line , the state 's total generating capacity is just under 34,000 megawatts , meaning that even if only a modest amount of the anticipated [P_036] added , the region would have a cushion , even in a hot summer . ? ? ?

in the [P_02] and ' 70s when the geysers got started , there was ' ' a real wildcatter 's [P_020] ' ' [P_023] generators , said rich ferguson , energy chairman for [P_034] california . ? ? '
basically , [P_02] out the water in the form of steam faster than mother nature was putting it back in , ' ' he said . ? ?
it began three years ago , when lake county [P_09] pumping its treated [P_013] into [P_016] . ? ?
now , more than 8 million [P_06] treated [P_09] is returned daily to [P_015] .

' many of these sites were looked at in the ' 80s , but then [P_015] because in the ' 90s natural [P_023] too cheap to meter , ' ' he said . ? ?
ferguson said the state spent $ 540 million over the [P_010] years on incentives for renewable energy projects , including geothermal , solar , wind and biomass , and he expects the plan will be renewed when it expires in december . ? ? ' '
steam from [P_02] is piped to the power plant , where it [P_013] turbines to create electricity .
after the remaining steam condenses back to liquid , it is returned to [P_013] . ? ? ?

because of its [P_03] deregulation [P_05] , california bears a lot of [P_012] - but not all of it , said susan f. tierney , a [P_027] secretary in the energy department , now a consultant for lexecon , a cambridge , mass. , consulting firm . ? ?
so they sold off [P_04] plants and bought power on the wholesale market , where it was cheap and plentiful . ? ?
[P_00] power prices went up , they could n't pass those [P_012] to consumers . ? ?
at the time , they did [P_06] that in a couple of years there would not be an [P_019] supply , " tierney said . ? ?
the internet , with [P_04] server [P_07] data hotels , also became a heavy power user . ? ?
because demand is so high this year , generators can charge [P_011] prices , knowing that california and the northwest have nowhere else to buy power . ? ?
[P_00] is [P_02] an island of tranquillity in the electric - [P_012] that has [P_016] california and [P_019] to spread across [P_023] ? ? ?

meyer lissner , a reform attorney often [P_07] as a [P_010] [P_012] , [P_015] holding of a decisive 1911 citywide straw poll on the subject because he knew most angelenos would cast their [P_036] for municipal ownership .
the most [P_02] partisans [P_04] power were not progressive [P_010] like lissner but the city 's much - maligned [P_020] , and for a simple reason .
without [P_01] 's dogged campaign for " gas and water socialism , " as well as its willingness to hand control of these resources to the anti - union regimes of mayors george alexander and henry rose , there would be no [P_043] today . ? ?
from that day on , l.a. 's unions never wavered in their call for a [P_015] water supply publicly managed .

a broad consensus [P_03] city 's construction of hydroelectric plants while the [P_013] [P_014] built , but most of the city 's [P_024] corporate lobbyists were committed [P_030] subsidies , not [P_035] ownership , of [P_039] power .
the 1911 straw poll , in which city [P_08] [P_09] their support for municipal ownership and distribution of owens river power , upset their plans . ? ?
the most consistent [P_03] for [P_05] during the decades after the straw poll were the central labor council , international brotherhood of electrical workers , other [P_027] city employees who [P_032] campaign envelopes , canvassed precincts and got out the vote .
[P_00] who favored municipally [P_04] and initiatives bolstering [P_09] tended to be working class [P_016] ; those opposed were mainly middle and upper class [P_027] . ? ?
in this polarized political climate , mayor alexander called for a $ 6.5-million [P_013] to complete the [P_018] - [P_020] network ; he left open the question of who would sell the [P_034] consumers .
wheeler led a successful [P_04] an attempt to split the power - [P_013] into two separate ballot propositions , one to complete the [P_025] 's generating stations , the other to create a city - [P_037] distribution system .
such a division would probably have doomed [P_07] . ? ?
the large majority of unionists who favored [P_07] had little time to savor wheeler 's victory .
while pressing [P_02] on the three electric companies , they faced a small but [P_015] split in their own [P_020] .
dissenters in the building trades [P_05] a few of its unions argued that labor 's [P_016] against the progressive regimes of 1909 - 14 had turned [P_027] for municipal ownership on its head .
what good was municipal ownership in the hands of a [P_010] mayor [P_013] [P_015] [P_017] [P_018] of peaceful picketers during the citywide strikes of 1910 , had [P_031] [P_032] workers and fed them bad food and had [P_041] unionists influential city jobs ?
[P_00] not folly to reward labor 's [P_08] with control of the [P_013] 's power ? ? ?
on its own , as well as in coalition with other groups , the labor movement marshaled its [P_018] file on behalf [P_023] power .
the pro - bond unions [P_05] win over the dissenting [P_011] ; rather , they overwhelmed it at the polls .

there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there -- indeed , last fall mr. [P_016] submitted a proposal that was well received by [P_025] -- but ferc has [P_031] all of them . ? ?
the charitable interpretation is that ferc still does n't get it , that it just ca n't bring itself to believe that this time the [P_025] is real .

[P_00] edison , pg&e split on strategy
dale kasler [P_02] [P_03] body : ? ?
[P_00] was more entrepreneurial , accustomed to the rough - and - tumble of free markets - and apparently believed only a radical remedy would cure its ills . ? ?
pg&e , with fewer ties [P_05] and possessed of an independent streak , walked away from [P_017] straight into u.s. bankruptcy court . ? ?
we now have two models ; it 'll be interesting to see who recovers the quickest , " said mitch wilk , a [P_023] [P_024] who is now an [P_030] in san francisco . ? ?
both [P_01] afflicted with the same problem : [P_09] [P_010] [P_012] were n't able to recover from [P_020] of a state - mandated [P_027] .
both had been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy since january , [P_012] losses depleted their cash reserves and credit . ? ?
the experience took pg&e out of the cozy world of the regulated [P_012] - in which the utility had exclusive rights to its service territory but [P_026] to state [P_030] - and into the world of competition . ? ?
while the original deregulation called for the cap on customer prices to end in 2002 , davis was [P_018] the utility remain regulated for a decade . ? ?
i believe pg&e was in [P_05] , " davis said in an interview with [P_014] [P_015] and reporters . ? ?
rather , what it wanted - and what davis ' negotiator michael peevey agreed to in principle - was to let the utility charge ratepayers for [P_026] costs of buying [P_031] , said pg&e spokesman ron low . ? ?
the discussions and negotiations broke [P_05] they would not agree to the basic principles that were reached by ( pg&e chairman )
pg&e also became [P_03] with a series of puc rulings in late march and early april that it believed would seriously hinder its ability to recover its debts . ? ?
the next morning , with glynn dismissing davis ' speech as " a lot [P_014] , " the utility filed for bankruptcy protection . ? ?
that afternoon , davis called pg&e " [P_07] " and pointedly went into a negotiating session with [P_017] , the [P_021] [P_023] of edison 's parent edison international . ? ?
although edison had tentatively agreed in february to sell [P_09] lines , the deal was n't sewn up and davis was nervous the pg&e bankruptcy would prompt edison 's creditors to " jerk edison into bankruptcy , " davis said last week . ? ?
notably , bryson was president of the puc in the 1970s - [P_012] was gov. jerry brown 's [P_019] staff . ? ?
politically savvy , edison is one of the utility industry 's biggest contributors to national [P_015] , and it usually spends more than pg&e on california campaigns .
edison international 's board of directors includes [P_07] attorney warren christopher , the [P_014] u.s. [P_016] state and an [P_021] statesman of [P_024] party . ? ?
lawmakers then [P_02] the iso to make the changes . ? ?
according to [P_02] barbara barkovich , edison figured , [P_010] wrestle with the [P_014] over profits when it simply could raise billions through a cash sale ? ? ?
if edison winds up in bankruptcy court , it " wo n't be [P_013] for it , " [P_018] . ? ?
southern california edison headquarters : rosemead , [P_07] county customers : 4.2 million in southern california chairman : [P_019] performance : lost $ 1.94 billion in 2000 on revenue of $ 11.72 billion stock [P_036] : eix ? ?
given [P_01] $ 20 billion in power purchase [P_09] the utilities and the state have accumulated so far , the stubbornly [P_023] prices and other data , it 's not unreasonable to project [P_036] in private utility areas will see their rates double , or rise even higher . ? ?
gov. [P_01] ' popularity has plummeted since [P_08] charge of the crisis , laying [P_016] to his intentions to seek an easy re - election next year as a middle - of - the - road , business - friendly , tough - on - crime education reformer . ? ?
with his popularity waning , davis may be [P_08] turn left , shoring up his base by catering to demands of [P_022] , environmentalists , trial lawyers and other [P_031] elements of [P_034] party .
here 's a message for pampered and overindulged [P_08] the golden state who [P_014] unceasingly about high energy bills and the day - to - day prospect of rolling blackouts : [P_032] whining . ? ? ?
callenbach 's work was a major influence on the alternative [P_010] [P_012] gov. jerry brown . ? ? ?
aside from the energy needs of the industry itself , the wealth it generated encouraged avaricious lifestyles that include power - swilling mansions and freeways clogged with monster [P_028] vehicles . ? ? ?
as we brace for deregulated electric bills courtesy of the [P_010] [P_012] , imagine what life was like for native [P_022] lived for millennia in a bounteous bay area without microwaves , waffle irons , air conditioning or 24-cubic - foot refrigerators .
but let 's consider the thought that we may actually be better off without the [P_015] appliances [P_018] [P_019] of cords clogs our homes and offices . ? ? ?
smug californians love to point to the state 's ranking as a miserly [P_013] of energy -- [P_017] other states [P_021] less per capita -- to rebut accusations that we have become [P_033] energy hogs .
potential benefits extend from [P_04] ( a revival of the conservation ethic ) to the curative ( making the state [P_021] to power - problem overloads ) to the liberating ( throwing off for good our dependence on the texas energy overlords ) . ? ? ?
alan ginsberg of satco products in hayward , who [P_09] china container - loads of squiggly shaped energy - saving fluorescent bulbs , says , " they 're flying out the door . " ? ? ?
it puts on the [P_04] [P_06] [P_07] fundamental question of whether our energy system should be in the hands of giant utilities or run by municipalities or by the state .
it certainly unveiled [P_03] of out - of - state energy producers who have [P_015] billions of [P_018] california . ? ? ?
the crisis has also made us focus on fundamental flaws in our energy grid , such as the 4,500-megawatt [P_019] that emerged in the 1990s while we were all reveling in california 's boom times . ? ? ?
if that happens , gov. [P_05] might yet confound [P_010] [P_011] his political prospects are sinking faster than you can say " megawatt . " ? ? ?
these days , the [P_04] in gathering our daily [P_010] is the hunt for a space in the supermarket parking lot . ? ? ?
and the [P_02] empire , dependent on raw materials from the colonies , began to collapse when it became too expensive to import goods across oceans . ? ? ?
if we get the message , " the net outcome ( of the energy crisis ) will be a quite profound shift in [P_023] in energy conservation , " predicts michael lerner , [P_033] of commonweal , a health and environmental institute in bolinas . ? ? ?
closer to home , one [P_05] gov. george deukmejian 's first [P_012] was to abolish the office of appropriate technology established by gov. jerry brown to move us away from our dependence on non - renewable fossil fuels . ? ? ?
even record high [P_03] have [P_06] to depress the sales of suvs , which now account for the largest share of [P_023] [P_024] truck sales ( 20 percent at last count ) . ? ? ?
the installation now puts surplus electricity back into the energy grid , instead of [P_014] more out of it . ? ? ?
[P_00] what 's needed for real policy governor : consumers deserve to get real facts from davis .
and everyone involved in the crisis expects blackouts this summer as demands for power [P_014] and supplies dwindle . ? ?
[P_00] strategy , if there is one , is to continue the state 's massive power purchases while negotiating longer - term and presumably cheaper supply contracts , encourage conservation , help [P_033] off their debts by [P_039] intercity transmission system to the state and tapping ratepayers , and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch . ? ?
clearly , davis rushed into the [P_06] [P_08] days after pg&e filed bankruptcy , in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latter action , but its provisions are being labeled a " bailout " by [P_039] .
it places only a token financial burden on edison international while guaranteeing the profitability of [P_015] subsidiary by charging its customers whatever is required to cover its costs and past debts . ? ?
meanwhile , the state is spending -- [P_07] ' own account -- about $ 70 million a day or $ 2-plus billion a month on spot power purchases , paying roughly [P_032] what consumers are [P_037] at the retail level .
he said tuesday that davis , who has maintained secrecy on power purchases , must offer a comprehensive [P_018] plan for dealing with the financial squeeze . ? ?
meanwhile , bankers are sending strong signals that the [P_09] is becoming as poor a lending risk as the utilities . ? ?
davis , for some reason , is unwilling [P_08] this situation the emergency that it is truly becoming -- one that could take a toll of human life if major blackouts [P_032] [P_034] , respirators and traffic lights .
he insists on issuing his periodic -- and wholly unrealistic -- assurances that things will turn out all right , even [P_021] to reporters this past tuesday that " we think we 'll have this thing licked by the end of fall . " ? ?
exactly what 's happening , the downside financial and power supply risks , and what 's being done to deal with [P_021] disaster facing this state . ? ?
it 's time for [P_04] treat us as adults who can face reality , not as children to be fed sugarcoated sound bites and slogans . ? ?
part a ; part 1 ; page 19 ; metro desk length : 679 words [P_015] : officials call price stability plan [P_022] ;
two [P_01] energy officials said friday that a federal plan to stabilize [P_013] in california could increase the odds of blackouts this summer and most likely is [P_029] . ? ?
in a [P_02] complaints attacking the federal [P_08] commission , the state 's top power regulator and the head of the board overseeing california 's transmission grid said they might challenge the [P_034] in court . ? ?
the [P_01] approved on a 2 - 1 vote wednesday and released to [P_014] late thursday . ? ?
we 're going to take whatever actions we can [P_09] this to the extent our lawyers tell us it 's [P_021] , " said [P_025] , an attorney named by gov. [P_033] to [P_036] board [P_039] [P_041] system operator .
in a conference call with reporters , kahn and [P_09] , president of the [P_015] [P_017] , said the order also seems to indicate that ferc is unwilling to force [P_033] to rebate any of the extraordinary [P_041] before last october in california 's market , where [P_052] prices began [P_056] last may. ? ?
and , according to kahn , the [P_07] [P_09] ties limits on power prices to a requirement that california link [P_021] grid with those of other states . ? ?
lynch and kahn said they do not believe it will bring down [P_012] or help the state [P_018] , as [P_022] . ? ?
they 're creating a whole new , wholesale blackout system , " said lynch , referring to a section of the order that allows large customers , such as steel mills and food processors , to get [P_037] [P_039] when grid operators are struggling to find [P_048] to meet demand . ? ?
though a somewhat similar program has helped california [P_08] , the [P_012] requires [P_015] buyers to name the price to which electricity must rise before they [P_029] customers . ? ?
the requirement of naming a price could lead to more blackouts , said stanford university economist frank [P_017] , because it prevents [P_022] from paying more if that 's what it takes to keep electricity flowing . ? ?
lynch said that [P_03] how this aspect of the ferc order unfolds , " it ai n't for washington bureaucrats to decide when the lights go out in california . " ? ?
when cal - iso can not find [P_07] , it must order southern california edison , pacific gas & electric and san diego gas & electric to trigger rotating blackouts . ? ?
the proposal [P_02] rep. [P_05] , the influential [P_010] the [P_013] [P_015] quality subcommittee , would permit producers of alternative and renewable energy to suspend their contracts with the state 's [P_036] investor - [P_040] and [P_043] supplies to a third party . ? ?
meanwhile , the utilities would [P_05] financial footing by selling assets to the state in exchange for [P_018] to recover a portion of their back debt through a surcharge on [P_032] . ? ?
added stephen e. frank , chairman , [P_07] [P_09] of southern california edison : " releasing them from [P_020] obligations will simply exacerbate the problem , because they would then be selling into the market at additionally higher rates and just compound the state 's problems . " ? ?
if 3,000 megawatts are made available again , it will have a potentially profound effect on what [P_017] for [P_020] bolstering overall electricity supplies , " peters said . ? ?
[P_00] [P_02] only 1,200 megawatts are offline because of payment problems . ? ?
they differ from their big out - of - state counterparts , which have been getting [P_016] the state . ? ?
the provisions dealing with waivers of environmental [P_07] been among the [P_012] , drawing opposition from environmentalists . ? ?

more commonly , cities - including davis , lincoln and culver city - have studied the idea [P_017] it , at least temporarily . ? ?
they all face the [P_04] , said santa rosa [P_010] jeffrey kolin : ? ?
kolin 's city , like scores of others across the state , has decided it is time to study the issue anew , [P_023] the prospect [P_027] electric bills , [P_032] blackouts , and pacific gas and electric co. 's bankruptcy filing . ? ?

with so many unknowns , the next few years are likelier to produce more studies than new utilities , said a number of city [P_024] attended a seminar in sacramento this week , sponsored in part by the [P_039] [P_041] . ? ?
[P_00] new york state sen. al coppola told the group the session should have been titled : " [P_018] from the [P_021] [P_022] baron utilities . " ? ?
[P_00] backers share three key [P_06] : ? ?
they can charge customers less because they do n't have to pay dividends to investors or pay taxes on their sales ; they can respond to local preferences on issues like which customers pay the lowest rates and how [P_039] [P_041] ; and existing utilities will do everything in [P_050] [P_052] them . ? ?

soon , a davis [P_04] ushers four [P_07] 10-gallon hats into an office , shots ring out , and the aide , emerging [P_024] - spattered , delivers the punch - line : " tell the governor his reliant problem is solved .
this is not a power grab , " [P_08] governor says in an interview .
yet in the past six months , pushed by what he calls the " [P_014] failure " of a [P_019] hatched under his [P_024] predecessor , the governor has put the state deep into the power business .
mr. davis says that [P_04] is part of what he sees as a " hybrid " system where [P_019] plays an important role augmenting private enterprise in the electricity business .
[P_00] it mean for [P_05] take over the role [ of buying power ] if the state already has signed all these contracts ? " asks state sen. [P_030] , a [P_034] [P_036] [P_038] 's energy committee .
mr. davis has been deeply enmeshed in [P_07] aspect of the electricity mess this year , after having once been relatively aloof from the burgeoning crisis .
under the [P_02] , the state 's investor - [P_010] sold off many of [P_016] plants to other companies and repurchased [P_024] through a state - sponsored auction .
[P_00] were frozen and customers were given the option to [P_011] from nonutility retail suppliers .
when mr. davis could n't get legislative permission to borrow money short - term for power purchases , he signed an [P_021] authorizing the state to borrow up to $ 5 billion from commercial lenders .
in another [P_02] , the governor suspended emission standards for power plants to let them run more hours during the peak - demand periods .
crisis [P_01] ' the electricity mess has produced " the most extraordinary crisis [P_014] we 've had in california in the postwar period , " says bruce cain , director of the [P_034] governmental studies at the university [P_041] at berkeley .
under a [P_02] in february , none of [P_09] [P_011] of dollars [P_015] electricity purchases or related costs can be [P_024] as imprudent by [P_028] [P_030] .
it scares the [P_03] out of me , " says henry [P_011] , a [P_014] puc member [P_017] [P_019] gov. pete wilson .
the governor 's [P_03] , [P_06] , says he does n't know whether they were asked about [P_019] [P_021] hired .
[P_00] , mr. davis argues , state negotiators did well enough .
still , he and some [P_05] leaders are [P_09] the puc to revoke a fundamental tenet of deregulation : the right of consumers to shop around for low - cost electricity .
removing this option is essential to prevent a " [P_09] break " of customers seeking prices lower than what the state must charge , says carl wood , one of mr. davis 's three [P_034] [P_035] to the five - member puc .
decisions are being made , with almost no [P_08] , that foreclose other options , " says ms. bowen , the [P_022] , who is close enough to the governor that she played his therapist in the " sopranos " skit .
one voice ' the state 's enlarged role in the utility business was on display when negotiators convened recently at the federal [P_022] commission in washington to discuss [P_029] supplier [P_031] .

" in the days to come , there will be recrimination and accusation , fingers pointing to determine [P_018] failure [P_020] this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from happening again .
as [P_01] we will weep , as [P_07] we will [P_010] , and as [P_014] , we will rise [P_019] of all that we cherish . "

yes , our view is that enron has no enforceable [P_010] [P_012] the basis of the facts placed before us and the provisions of the agreement .
enron 's right to the fixed fee [P_07] under the agreement , is contingent upon dpc [P_017] the corresponding ppa fuel [P_023] by mseb .
as a result , enron has no [P_07] [P_09] non - payment of the ppa fuel [P_018] to dpc and therefore has no [P_026] mseb under the agreement as there is no breach by mseb of its functions under the agreement .

california 's economy is [P_04] , the state 's tax coffers -- and davis ' own re - election treasury -- are bulging , [P_024] in a complacent mood , and there have been none of the devastating disasters that plagued the [P_043] the early 1990s .
there is , however , a very dark cloud casting a shadow over davis ' [P_015] : the prospect of rolling [P_021] demand for electric power exceeds supply , accompanied by tremendous increases in californians ' [P_037] .

the two are still operating under the [P_07] , but have acquired at least $ 5 billion in unanticipated [P_020] costs that they want to pass on to their ratepayers .

the utilities seem to be offering davis a deal : allow them to begin raising rates now to [P_018] " stranded costs " [P_024] power and they will avoid sticker - shock raises in 2002 .

i find it impossible that anyone can seriously believe that because there is much poverty in the middle east , [P_020] who are not themselves poor concluded that the corrective was [P_031] the world trade center [P_037] [P_039] and [P_042] thousands of [P_045] .

poverty reduction , if all of these needs are met , must then be a conscious part of government programs , which [P_022] bumper - sticker slogans like " reduce poverty " are fatuous .
yes , it does , but what [P_07] with that ?

an energy company accused [P_04] [P_06] drive [P_09] in california 's electricity market agreed to pay $ 8 million in a settlement approved monday [P_027] energy regulators . ? ?
the settlement is the first by a company accused of charging [P_011] [P_012] in the state . ? ?
the purchases were made in a 10-day period [P_08] and
instead , the company [P_04] $ 750 a [P_09] for [P_012] other aes generating units during that period . ? ?
aes , which [P_03] [P_04] generated at its three plants in southern california to williams under a contract , did not share in the profits from the power sales . ? ?
officials at williams have [P_04] [P_05] the units were [P_010] [P_011] .
as part of the settlement , the company did not admit [P_011] . ? ?
federal officials had required williams [P_05] [P_07] more than $ 40 million [P_014] the iso .
in a separate matter , williams is one of several [P_010] accused [P_013] regulators of overcharging the iso $ [P_021] for power in january and february .
the [P_01] are still [P_05] those charges . ? ?

for the first time in california 's current energy crisis , a [P_012] accused of [P_016] the state 's [P_020] market has agreed to return a slice of its profits . ? ?
but williams admitted no [P_04] and ferc specifically stated that it was not finding any [P_015] [P_017] .
the agreement was promptly [P_04] [P_06] who [P_09] williams and other [P_014] have made [P_018] [P_020] by selling in california 's troubled wholesale market . ? ?
an $ 8 million refund [P_05] in the context of the [P_012] rates that these marketers , like williams , have been receiving , " [P_026] carl wood , a member of the [P_034] [P_036] . ? ?
the broader issue is like somebody walking out of a bank having [P_012] them of $ 1,000 and [P_018] [P_020] them at the door and tell them : ' you 're going to have to hand back $ 10 , ' " wood [P_044] .
california authorities had [P_03] [P_05] [P_07] $ 33 million [P_012] , or [P_016] the $ 11 million in revenue [P_024] authorities initially estimated williams had made from the two plant [P_036] - downs .
federal [P_01] n't available for comment monday and it was n't [P_012] the $ 8 million refund was determined . ? ?
she said the $ 8 million would simply be applied against the $ 252 million that williams [P_017] for other energy purchases by the iso and the state 's now - defunct [P_033] . ? ?
in three other cases that do n't involve plant outages , ferc [P_012] suppliers [P_015] [P_017] [P_019] up to $ 125 million in profits .
[P_00] are still pending . ? ?
in a separate proceeding , state [P_06] [P_08] ferc [P_010] williams ' application for permission to [P_018] electricity in california at unregulated [P_025] .
the episode occurred [P_03] [P_05] prices began to [P_010] statewide last summer .
but because those units were n't subject to the same contract , a ferc statement said the [P_017] forced to pay williams a spot market price of nearly $ 750 [P_031] hour
an aes spokesman said his firm has [P_07] to manipulate plant outages because it has contracted to sell all of [P_021] to williams at a pre - determined rate . ? ?
the energy woes [P_03] and [P_06] can not be solved with [P_013] or conservation , but only by increasing the country 's supply of oil and natural gas and using more coal and [P_036] , vice [P_040] [P_042] monday . ? ?
and the rest [P_03] is starting to wonder when these rolling blackouts might roll over them , " [P_019] in a toronto speech to the [P_027] . ? ?
without a clear , coherent energy strategy for [P_08] , [P_011] could one day go through what californians are experiencing now , or worse , " warned [P_029] [P_030] the administration 's high - level energy task force . ? ?
the aim here is efficiency , not austerity , " [P_010] , [P_013] [P_015] that [P_017] should be told to " do more with less . " ? ?
conservation may be a sign [P_05] [P_07] , but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound , comprehensive energy policy , " he said . ? ?
earlier this month , davis approved an $ [P_08] energy conservation plan that offers incentives to try to shave at least 2,000 megawatts a day off the state 's [P_030] . ? ?
[P_00] monday [P_03] [P_04] [P_06] for belittling conservation programs . ? ?
that [P_01] [P_03] , " davis said , referring [P_010] 's texas oil roots [P_016] 's tenure as the head of
although [P_01] approved measures last week designed to [P_09] the cost of electricity in california , the plan fell [P_021] of hard [P_025] . ? ?

if we 're serious about [P_05] , then we must seriously [P_012] wisdom of [P_016] from what is , as a matter of record , a safe , clean and very plentiful energy source . " ? ?
carl pope , [P_03] of the [P_07] , said [P_011] house is trying to convince people that their plan to ramp up energy production , even at the [P_031] environmental concerns , is the only way to solve the energy problems . ? ?
from the beginning , the administration has wanted to tell the [P_011] that they did n't have any choice , that the only way they could transport themselves to work , heat their houses , toast their toast was to ruin the environment , " he said . ? ?
they 've been out pushing this agenda for a hundred days and the [P_013] are rejecting it , " pope said . ? ?

federal energy regulators have proposed a surcharge [P_07] electricity sales in california to compensate [P_015] , angering [P_019] [P_021] the idea [P_025] [P_027] consumers . ? ? ?
electric co. [P_02] accrued some $ 6 billion [P_09] [P_011] california 's struggling utilities in late 2000 and early this year , until the state stepped in to take over the purchasing of power . ? ? ?
dianne feinstein , d - calif . , who has been an outspoken [P_013] ferc 's [P_017] california , said the surcharge would " ensure [P_027] generators get paid fully for [P_034] [P_036] .
the dwr 's costs , in turn , are likely to be borne [P_013] 's consumers and [P_018] . ? ? ?
if ( ferc 's ) concern [P_06] policy and maintaining [P_011] reasonable prices for consumers , i do n't quite [P_022] they would get into the middle of a legal wrangle about past bills ' getting paid , " said [P_043] , director of the university [P_050] [P_052] in berkeley .
[P_00] [P_02] surcharge as a " [P_08] tax " that underscores the [P_014] 's close ties to energy firms , many of which are based in [P_029] 's home state of texas . ? ? ?
this [P_01] that ferc and the [P_07] more interested in [P_012] energy industry than the [P_018] [P_020] [P_021] , " [P_025] [P_027] , a [P_030] with [P_033] [P_035] - based foundation [P_039] [P_041] rights .
it 's back - billing us to pay prices that were [P_011] unreasonable per the ferc 's own analysis . " ? ? ?
ferc 's [P_02] , a mississippi [P_07] whom [P_09] appointed [P_012] the commission , was behind the surcharge proposal , which he told the wall street journal was a way " to stabilize the market .
the surcharge was proposed in ferc 's 39-page " mitigation " plan to alleviate [P_014] prices in california [P_019] emergencies ; the plan was released last week .
ferc said it would accept [P_05] comment on the proposal for 30 days , after which it would decide whether to implement it . ? ? ?
i 'm not sure how [P_05] can pass a charge [P_011] costs which then ends up on consumers , without the state saying it 's ok .
the reference to " future [P_05] " is puzzling since , with the state [P_015] picking up the tab , [P_022] no longer are accumulating [P_028] from the utilities . ? ? ?
the ferc proposal also implies [P_05] generators have reduced production in california , an [P_015] the [P_017] themselves [P_020] .

and he has consulted with pig [P_06] thailand and the philippines about methane power . ? ?
williams co. of tulsa , a major supplier of electricity to california , yesterday agreed [P_015] $ 8 million to the state to settle [P_025] into [P_028] overcharging [P_030] the federal [P_034] commission . ? ? ?
[P_00] company admitted engaging in [P_05] in agreeing to the settlement , ferc said . ? ? ?
although ferc has directed more than a dozen california [P_09] [P_011] $ 124.5 million [P_016] [P_018] power bids to the state , the williams - aes case is
the only enforcement action ferc has brought so far involving california 's extraordinary [P_013] costs . ? ? ?
we are [P_02] a penny of this [ the ferc settlement ] , and i think that speaks volumes . " ? ? ?
california 's [P_02] commission had [P_06] [P_08] triple damages if found [P_014] of federal regulations , but ferc said the heavier [P_025] were [P_027] . ? ? ?
williams received a fee for this service and was also entitled to be reimbursed for plant operating costs at an hourly rate of about $ 63 [P_026] . ? ? ?
on different occasions in april and may , the [P_09] [P_011] the [P_014] not in service and the state 's grid manager , the [P_027] operator , had to buy power from other aes units [P_039] by the supply contract .

shippers [P_01] northwest 's must - flow ofos several northern nevada industrial gas users have accused northwest pipeline of [P_019] [P_020] by holding them [P_025] to the daily must - flow operational flow orders ( ofos ) that it has issued since early december in an effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system .
in a section 5 [P_04] [P_05] , the industrial gas customers called on ferc to direct northwest to " [P_020] desist " the [P_025] [P_026] the tariff , which [P_032] is [P_035] them and other customers at the northern end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs of customers on the southern end [P_061] 's system .
nevertheless , the pipeline 's daily must - flow ofos " have [P_012] into the volatile [P_017] market to avoid extremely high non - compliance penalties , [P_029] their business decisions to rely on alternative fuels , " they told ferc [ [P_044] - 189].
if one of the nevada [P_05] , newmont mining corp. , had defied northwest 's order to flow 25 % of [P_022] demand , or 1,000/dth , on any december day , it would have been penalized $ 58,160 for that one day , they said .
if all of the nevada industrial customers had [P_08] the pipeline 's order , the one - day [P_018] would have been $ 149,471 .
that 's because it requires one group of shippers , [P_010] no additional benefits , to incur gas acquisition and transportation costs [P_023] subsidize service to another group of shippers , they argued .

polanco ally martha [P_03] , now a [P_07] from whittier , [P_012] [P_013] of hijacking her 1997 bill to create the healthy families program , which provides medical coverage for children in low - income households . ? ?
[P_00] lists the healthy families legislation as one of [P_09] key accomplishments in sacramento , along with the school and parks bond measures and his participation in a 1999 [P_030] [P_031] [P_032] . ? ?
moreover , the final bill that emerged , with [P_09] listed as a principal author , contained much of the [P_020] as the [P_024] bill but does not carry [P_030] . ? ?
[P_00] [P_01] those [P_03] , [P_05] had introduced similar " universal coverage for children " bills in previous sessions .
[P_00] bill in 1996 [P_05] it out of the health committee but did have a line stating that all [P_021] 18 " should be entitled to child [P_030] . " ? ?
now , an oakland - based children 's [P_08] that was a principal sponsor of the bill that finally passed , said [P_023] legitimately deserves most of the credit . ? ?
[P_00] " jockeyed the bill in the assembly , but jockeying should not be confused with passing it or writing it , " he said . ? ?
hertzberg , a hyperkinetic [P_04] bond attorney , replaced [P_09] as speaker in april 2000 . ? ?
but by the spring of 1999 , hertzberg was already gathering signatures and [P_013] own move against [P_018] . ? ?
but [P_01] also kept $ 1.3 million for [P_08] campaign chest , putting it in an account to run for [P_021] in 2002 should his [P_027] campaign fail . ? ?
bustamante had done the [P_04] , taking more than $ 1 million he had raised as speaker to finance his successful 1998 campaign for [P_025] .
[P_00] had loudly [P_03] bustamante move , so most of [P_011] in [P_014] caucus expected him to leave the money behind .
[P_00] [P_01] money transfer by saying , accurately , that he had already given more money back to democrats than any previous speaker . ? ?
this personal fallout aside , [P_05] 's legacy as speaker remains his ability to get along with most [P_018] 's influential figures , building political bridges as he went . ? ?
in each case , however , [P_06] colleagues [P_08] at least some of the the heavy lifting was done by other lawmakers . ? ?
but whittier state sen. martha [P_05] [P_06] [P_08] [P_09] bill , filed earlier , and morphed it into [P_020] . ? ?

the agreement to meet came after a weekend during which vice [P_011] [P_013] called one of [P_017] governor 's ideas " goofy " and [P_026] a " harebrained scheme " davis ' decision to [P_037] , and davis [P_042] bush - [P_046] plan for [P_050] address california 's needs . ? ?
[P_00] [P_02] [P_04] [P_06] will meet with davis next week , probably tuesday . ? ?
[P_00] up with a [P_05] wednesday in which he requested a meeting " to discuss the most difficult issue facing the consumers and businesses [P_026] : energy . " ? ?
in [P_01] , [P_04] that california 's energy crisis " is a national economic issue . " ? ?
davis has been [P_03] the [P_06] cap [P_09] [P_011] by [P_014] companies , something the president [P_021] . ? ?
the state ; the energy crisis ; reliant offers [P_09] prices if rules waived ; [P_016] :
a houston - based energy wholesaler [P_06] by gov. [P_010] for charging sky - high amounts offered on wednesday [P_021] prices 80 % if [P_027] regulators waive certain rules . ? ?
three of the company 's power plants can run only a limited number of hours each year under [P_018] rules designed to reduce [P_024] . ? ?
in a letter to davis ' [P_06] , company vice [P_011] stout proposed that the state not subtract from reliant 's allotted hours whenever [P_026] are [P_029] run by state grid operators , [P_037] power on an emergency basis to prevent uncontrolled blackouts . ? ?
earlier this month , the [P_05] buyers paid reliant $ 1,900 [P_012] - hour , [P_017] recent market prices , to [P_024] on a hot afternoon .
davis [P_01] publicly , naming the price and the seller -- information that grid operators are supposed to keep confidential [P_020] rules . ? ?
we 're not sure of [P_05] behind reliant 's proposal , " [P_013] allard , top regulator at the santa barbara [P_023] [P_025] district .
that is possible , allard said , because a 1991 test of the plant 's [P_015] concluded that it [P_019] one - third as much [P_026] -- a [P_030] to [P_032] -- as regulators believed when they wrote the permit years ago . ? ?
the proposal , part of an emerging strategy to avert blackouts this summer , is one of several options being advanced by richard sklar , whom gov. davis appointed last month to bring more electricity online with less [P_038] . ? ?
but environmentalists [P_02] quality officials are [P_07] , calling the plan a recipe for unhealthy air during the smoggiest months in [P_022] 's most polluted state .
the legions of small backup generators typically burn diesel fuel and have no [P_013] . ? ?
california has about 17,200 backup generators , most in hospitals , office buildings , [P_014] treatment plants [P_017] labs , although some are portable rentals . ? ?
each generator spews 500 [P_04] nitrogen [P_07] for each megawatt of [P_012] a natural - gas fired power plant , according to the state [P_026] board .
nitrogen [P_01] contributes to ozone and microscopic airborne particles , two abundant air pollutants . ? ?
only about 550 megawatts could be generated each day , officials say , in a state that requires nearly 100 [P_020] much to function . ? ?
gov. [P_01] will issue an [P_06] today requiring [P_010] be given at least one hour 's notice before [P_021] , according to a top administration official . ? ? ?
the [P_01] is scheduled to discuss its plan at a meeting today . ? ? ?
[P_00] said the two - day notice would go to law enforcement , while everyone would get a 24-hour warning . ? ? ?
but one [P_02] group [P_04] should be doing more [P_010] [P_012] from happening in the first place . ? ? ?
[P_00] safety aspect must be taken into account , said one [P_012] group . ? ? ?
? -- when the [P_04] , turn one appliance on at a time to prevent power surges . ? ? ?
-- tell children who are home alone to remain calm , [P_011] [P_013] and computers and not to use candles .
the state 's [P_03] , out - of - state energy providers , [P_014] and the legislature all come out worse than [P_024] the survey . ? ? ?
davis ' [P_02] gone down , but a lot of others are given lower ratings " [P_017] are asked to [P_022] how the [P_025] institutions are handling the state 's energy situation , said mark dicamillo , director of the field poll . ? ? ?
growing worries about [P_03] of the [P_07] have sent ratings skidding for anyone connected with the energy business . ? ? ?
but 54 percent also put bush 's efforts in the poor / very poor category , and [P_017] consigned the federal [P_022] commission to the same level . ? ? ?
to the extent [P_03] officials are seen as not [P_010] on that issue , " he said , " i suspect that [P_023] will continue to be rather dismal . " ? ? ?
the percentage of residents giving him poor or very poor marks jumped to 38 percent , up from [P_018] in january . ? ? ?
in [P_01] 's eye , it 's everyone else that is not doing what they should be doing . " ? ? ?
the field poll [P_03] graphic ? ?
the proposal , one of several options the governor is considering , would pay for diesel power - which at its dirtiest is 500 [P_024] polluting than the cleanest natural gas power plants - [P_035] supplies are stretched . ? ?
california 's persistent [P_03] has [P_06] rolling blackouts around the state [P_013] this year , with more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air conditioning . ? ?
that 's more than [P_04] the [P_07] power plants produced on an average day in 1999 , according to state [P_021] board data . ? ?
but since the state 's [P_05] began , regional air - quality regulators have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently . ? ?

burton is obviously troubled by the mou ; he said " some people " say it does n't just make edison creditworthy , it [P_024] whole .
he said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more ( note : this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from [P_042] talk shows and [P_046] ) .
the state is going to have blackouts whether or not [P_010] top dollar , he said , so this is one way he sees to fight back .

this technique of entering a [P_05] agreement is commonly referred to as the " information model " and is subject to strict and ongoing form requirements .

here , where she [P_04] and spends most of her day , she has none of the small [P_018] servants considered necessary by middle - class delhi .
it 's a sharp [P_04] the vehemence and coruscating wit of her writing .
i like [P_02] that my rage goes into bigger things , [P_012] small , petty things with people [P_020] , " she says .
and once you 've seen it , keeping quiet , saying [P_011] , becomes [P_014] [P_016] as speaking out .
what anchored her as she spun around the globe was home , and she [P_014] temptations of emigration .
the title was misplaced , however , because what then captured her imagination , and has done ever since , was that the biggest mass non - [P_027] movement since indian [P_031] - the campaign against the narmada valley dams - was then on the brink of victory .
like any [P_02] , she wants to understand and tell stories , and dams sum up , like [P_018] else , the [P_022] modern india : its [P_028] , its wanton [P_032] and its centralisation of power .
it was just a slow , sludging green ribbon lawn that ferried fetid [P_013] to the sea .
[P_00] and dams are the corollary [P_06] 's slums : the [P_012] have diverted the taxes , and the dams have deprived millions of their lands and their [P_029] .
despite the legal cases , and the [P_07] [P_08] and savage [P_011] the media , [P_016] [P_018] allies , roy is standing her ground .

over the next few weeks , police will have to drag people from their homes to prevent suicide [P_018] by drowning : " while the judges are discussing our [P_029] [P_030] case , people will stand chest - deep in water for days .
in reality , many of those who [P_07] lands or livelihoods are likely to receive [P_016] more than paltry financial compensation .
in reality , the dams will provide electricity and water for the prospering urban industrial interests of the state - which [P_021] [P_023] court judgment was greeted with jubilation in gujarat 's cities .
enron was accused of smoothing the path of its massive contract to build a power plant near bombay with dollars 20 m to " educate " [P_026] bureaucrats ; now the electricity enron produces is more expensive than any of its competitors ' , yet maharastra state is locked into contractual payments of dollars 220 m a year .
the lobotomy in the west is that [P_07] seeing something and then , slowly , it 's not possible to see it .
that 's [P_02] could n't forgive her and her mother when she was growing up in kerala , she remembers - [P_022] were n't as unhappy as a single mother and her " thin , black , clever " daughter should have been .
i remember what [P_03] said to me : ' i 've never known anyone who guards their happiness so fiercely . '
i think it 's important to patrol the borders of your happiness , to understand your sources of joy and to protect them , and to know that , [P_029] , it 's only when that happiness has gone that you know what it was .
she describes her friends as " extraordinary people " for dealing with her sudden fame and money , and managing to maintain the " [P_024] nature of our friendships " .
none of [P_02] money before , now she gives hers away , " and i know that it is as sophisticated [P_022] to receive as to give it " .
she has probably made enough from the one novel to live on for the rest of her life ; she eschewed more , [P_023] sell the film rights , [P_030] democratically that [P_033] readers had their own version of the film in [P_044] and she did n't want a single film - maker to replace them all .
the fame has been burdensome , although she [P_08] ( somewhat implausibly , since she [P_015] hair cut , a [P_021] of rare defiance in a [P_027] fetishises long hair ) that she has some anonymity in india ( when asked if she is arundhati roy , she says her standard reply is that she wishes she were ) .
the most important thing , she says , is to keep in mind your own insignificance ; she ca n't speak [P_021] issue and do them all [P_028] .
she lambasts the pact of mediocrity to which the vast majority of people subscribe in their marriages , and confesses herself bewildered as [P_023] so [P_026] have children .
i use it to live my life in the most [P_010] and the most private way , and i love [P_020] kinds of writing : a novel , [P_029] , a letter .
it is roy 's passion for writing that stiffened her resolve not to take the lawyers ' advice and apologise to [P_021] court , and she describes a poignantly revealing dream she had before the last hearing :
it is dark when we finish talking , and the apartment block is [P_013] .

rappers for america london 's guardian reports that rap music -- once a genre [P_014] politics [P_016] mostly of [P_019] opposition to authority -- has become patriotic in the wake of sept. 11 .
they announced that anybody wearing the flag , which they described as " [P_013] gang colours " , would not be admitted to their shows .
[P_00] , they have not had quite as many invitations to appear on [P_013] as hammer , and they recently accused magazines such as rolling stone of diluting their statements to make them more palatable .
crucially , though , the coup and the handful of other anti - [P_013] rappers sell relatively little , and to a predominately [P_023] , [P_025] fanbase , a sub - genre known as backpacker hip - hop .
in an interview with [P_04] of london , film director robert altman sounds off on politics :
when i see [P_03] flag flying , it 's a [P_011] .
first off is sandy tolan , an " independent [P_09] [P_010] documentary producer " who penned a usa today column denouncing the media for being too patriotic .
she 's [P_02] journalists who think [P_07] would tell [P_011] , but she 's all for dubious sources -- as long as they 're anti - american :
a careful reading [P_03] [P_05] finds [P_07] [P_08] which dozens , even hundreds , of civilians have been [P_020] by u.s. [P_023] .
the bombings are often covered as " collateral " damage that " happens in [P_014] .
other times , pentagon [P_04] coming out [P_07] are given equal credibility with eyewitness reports from anti - [P_019] villagers on the ground ; the story dissolves into a [P_030] balance of he - said , she - said .
unlike in europe , the u.s. press [P_07] focuses on the growing rage over [P_014] falling on civilians .
but how else do we explain that , in early december , the [P_013] [P_014] robert fisk was nearly [P_019] death by bombed - out [P_026] [P_027] just inside [P_030] border ?
* * the new hampshire " study " she cites is pure [P_012] science ; it bases its conclusions on such sources of " information " as the pro - islamist al - jazeera [P_034] .
as for fisk , she accepts at face value this notoriously anti - american [P_014] 's ideologically self - serving interpretation of his beating , which , as we noted , sounded to us like a simple [P_037] attempt .
* * quote * * * minus the torture , the united states is now doing [P_016] [P_018] regimes have been doing for decades : arresting their [P_028] " islamist " [P_032] , holding them incommunicado , chained and hooded , while preparing [P_044] trials .

[P_00] [P_01] during his 8-year [P_06] , stockdale lived without any [P_012] 's rights , no set release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his family .
he shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal [P_010] [P_011] captors and their [P_016] to use the prisoners for propaganda .

for instance , mr. [P_04] 's office has gone to san francisco state court [P_014] [P_016] against reliant , houston - based dynegy inc. , and southern co. [P_029] corp. , both of atlanta , after the companies [P_040] [P_041] certain business documents they deemed confidential .
[P_00] [P_02] and the [P_06] general investigation : [P_011] and power traders have acted [P_018] through [P_020] or other means to [P_025] [P_026] [P_027] .
fed up with [P_03] customer 's [P_07] [P_09] bills , the enron corporation 's indian power - generating venture served formal notice on saturday that it would terminate [P_031] supply contract and pull out .
the move by the [P_04] company , [P_08] [P_010] enron , starts the clock ticking on a six - month notice period before the contract is [P_029] , during which negotiations to settle the dispute are expected .
dabhol said it was left with little choice but to issue the [P_012] after both governments [P_017] [P_019] contractual commitments to buy and pay for its output .
labeling consultants [P_02] and [P_05] as " cut - throat , " [P_014] [P_015] leader [P_017] of [P_020] cucamonga and [P_023] leader [P_026] of fair [P_030] in a letter to davis that the hiring " undermines the [P_043] you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis .
" " [P_02] , " [P_06] added , " ought to be spending time writing letters to george w. bush to get him [P_024] the texas [P_028] [P_030] california . . . .
marc rich gains control of swiss firm marc rich , the [P_011] u.s. fugitive given a controversial [P_017] by president [P_020] , effectively pulled off a management coup at swiss real - estate company feldschloesschen - huerlimann holding by thwarting its merger plans with swiss prime site and [P_048] board [P_051] .
mr. rich [P_02] is not on the board , but [P_010] more than 10 % of [P_017] in feldschloesschen .
the company said the move is not related to a filing by its 65%-owned [P_014] co. to india 's [P_020] 's [P_023] [P_025] [P_027] because it 's owed about $ 63.9 million by the board .
now it ( electricity ) can not be at any cost , " v.p. baligar , [P_016] managing director of the karnataka [P_023] transmission corp ltd ( kptcl ) , the state 's [P_035] [P_036] , told reuters in an interview late on monday .
the $ 2.9-billion project , which is 90-percent complete , was first [P_012] a [P_015] india 's decade - old reform programme but now [P_026] by [P_029] as a [P_032] [P_033] [P_035] .
one generating firm , jindal tractabel , [P_07] coal and gas , gets about 2.60 [P_016] .
a top [P_02] told reuters in delhi on monday the [P_011] is optimistic houston - based enron and [P_020] state will resolve their wrangle .
it is sad [P_03] enron had to issue its pre - [P_012] .
interruptions are commonplace in rural areas ( sometimes up to [P_010] a week ) .
we should call a [P_04] to such commissions as [P_09] 10 per cent of their purpose is served ; they too entail huge establishments which are maintained year after year at [P_032] expense .
even in asset - formation , [P_06] ( even [P_09] ) are leagues ahead of the other [P_017] .
it leaves several players mseb , successive [P_07] governments , the [P_011] re - negotiation exercise , the central electricity authority , and other players in new delhi with no clothes on .
but this was patently [P_04] , because the comparison was based on [P_012] numbers , incorrect technical parameters and unequal assumptions ( one rupee - dollar rate for the dabhol tariff , another for calculating the government formula ) , all of it designed to establish what was [P_048] .
[P_00] court [P_03] had been no [P_08] , [P_011] ( believe it or not ) was [P_020] was not competent to handle [P_027] .
the cea agrees to this untenable proposition , but later issues a [P_012] [P_013] clearance on the basis of a meeting [P_021] minutes were not made available to the [P_029] .
what the report shows is that the dabhol contract can be subjected to legal test ( as in fact two members of the [P_023] recommend ) , on [P_029] that it was [P_034] handled and violative of law and [P_041] .
for reasons that are [P_04] , mseb and [P_09] [P_011] chosen not to go down this route .
at the same time , the crisis gripping electricity - [P_010] is showing other [P_015] pitfalls to avoid as they deregulate their grids .
saturday , [P_02] , [P_05] [P_07] enron corp. of the u.s. , started a procedure to [P_019] power supply contract to the [P_026] , its [P_030] customer , which owes over 3 billion indian [P_039] ( $ [P_042] ) [P_045] [P_047] .
[P_00] [P_02] board , the dabhol plant 's [P_010] , is [P_014] [P_016] bills , [P_020] the tariffs are unjustifiably [P_026] .
half of delhi 's electricity output is stolen , mostly to power middle - class [P_015] rather than [P_019] for the poor .
bankrupt [P_01] are then periodically bailed out to [P_09] of spending on health and education .

cellucci said , " we [P_05] these power plants to clean up their act , and they have answered our call to meet the most comprehensive air emissions standards in the united states .

industry insiders believe that an order from the federal [P_09] commission ( ferc ) [P_015] a new board is imminent [P_022] the [P_025] the iso during the energy crisis and in the months that have followed as reason for ferc commissioners to act promptly .
a bombshell was released last week by rep. [P_08] ( r - ca ) in a letter to ferc accusing the iso and the california department of water resources ( dwr ) of acting in tandem to such an extent that their dealings appear to be in [P_048] and prohibitive of actual [P_053] .
attached to the ose [P_04] a confidential memo from [P_010] eric woychik to then [P_016] governor mike florio .
ose states in [P_03] to ferc that the memo " clearly illustrates [P_013] of a lack of [P_019] " from [P_022] .
[P_00] pat wood tells electric power alert that the commission " currently has a motion before us to address " [P_021] of the iso .

florio , who is now with the [P_07] organization the [P_010] network ( turn ) , [P_017] the iso is more independent than previous boards and has local oversight .
[P_00] on to state that , having served on the [P_011] and the previous stakeholder board , he is in a position to " say unequivocally that the current board gives iso management much more free [P_038] than the old board ever did . "
according to the [P_03] , californians " have an ace up our sleeves " to force [P_017] on the [P_020] if ferc does not act swiftly .
a ferc insider confirms that there have been commission level " discussions about the cal - iso for some time , " and that they have [P_026] a number of complaints against the iso for [P_035] lack of [P_038] .
the sunshine notice that [P_04] the agenda items for discussion will not be released until dec. 12 , but insiders believe that the political pressures on ferc , [P_028] that they have recently been issuing orders to the iso , and the woods ' acknowledgement that it is an item [P_051] indicate that they are going to be discussing the item , if [P_065] on it , at the next meeting .

: some employers are seeking - and winning - [P_09] against [P_011] their lawyers in frivolous [P_017] cases
some famous author once wrote ( and i ca n't find his [P_012] ) : " no one ever greeted the first of the year with indifference .
" is one of the most characteristic words in [P_09] .
according to my count the word " wait " is found in [P_012] exactly 100 times .
and yet , historically , the church has had to be hit over the head before it opens its eyes to what is happening in the world , content to let the world be [P_034] unless it enters our ecclesiastical ghetto .
no urgency , no living on tiptoe , not breathless as to the [P_013] god being here and now .

i am living out [P_04] [P_06] within [P_09] tradition
there is no way to know what is " [P_09] " about this because there is no way we can step outside our own personal and cultural history and context .
someone has said that a [P_05] is an evangelical [P_09] who is [P_012] about something .
you also have to keep in mind that ordinary people simply did [P_012] [P_014] until about 500 years ago .
a positive one is that it made real what the protestant reformation [P_012] about - the priesthood of believers or , as marcus borg [P_025] , the democratization of christianity .
think of it : prior to the invention of the printing press no [P_013] seen such a [P_018] a bible .
but once all the books were selected ( which is another story ! ) and bound into one volume , it was easy to think of [P_026] as a single book - [P_033] library that it is - and that this book had a single author , god .
if one takes a billable hours approach to life , [P_010] is just like every other .
i asked a [P_03] [P_04] ( a redundancy ) once on [P_011] show i did years ago if the [P_020] were still expecting [P_024] .
jesus spoke this parable to the [P_06] leaders of the day and was trying to arouse them to [P_018] that their day of destiny as the [P_027] [P_029] upon them - right now .
spiritual language is full of [P_05] like that , [P_09] that convey a [P_013] that is greater than literal [P_019] .
[P_00] are what make [P_04] vivid .
for example , one [P_04] [P_05] , one of our continuing experiences is the tendency we have [P_017] our humanity and attempt to be god to ourselves .
this [P_01] is such a central issue in the living of our lives that you can [P_016] say all there is to say about it .
if we turn our backs on this sometimes hard , [P_010] , grim world as it is , we turn our backs on the only source for knowing god we ever have had or every will have .
the heart of spiritual [P_04] about the [P_08] god is right here , right now .
i 'm not asking you to believe [P_07] is going to come knocking on your door tonight or that he is going to come back and walk [P_028] as a [P_032] as [P_035] before .
supposing our [P_02] [P_04] crossed [P_07] ?

we are to be faithful in god 's absence because god [P_011] absent .
there is [P_02] [P_04] love [P_07] all around us ?
one meaning of the word " wait " in [P_09] draws the picture of being stretched taut , of being pulled .
it is in waiting like this that the very reality of faith is unfolded because faith implies a certain not having , a certain [P_024] , a certain being without .
it is in this kind of waiting where being [P_09] is so [P_012] being spiritual is so essential .

mr. mclain again appeared before the committee and again [P_09] produce the documents at which point , [P_018] [P_020] in [P_023] stating : " that , based upon [P_032] in its possession , the said [P_039] interim committee has determined that each of the books , papers , and documents specified [P_055] [P_057] [P_058] is material to the matters now [P_066] by the said [P_071] interim committee , and the production of such books , papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said [P_092] interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the [P_0108] of the state [P_0112] pursuant to said [P_0117] resolution no . 162 .
