the list is still a work [P_92] , therefore , if you see anything that i [P_95] missing or appears to be incorrect - [P_98] .
[P_90] migrate [P_91] production ( www.hottap.enron.com ) [P_93] monday night , and i [P_96] a confirmation email out when it is done .
[P_90] from the commercial side .
otherwise , this is what we [P_92] for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line .

still , we 'd [P_91] a little bounce .
we only [P_90] 'd bought our other favorite drooy as well .
your results [P_90] vary , and standard disclaimers [P_92] apply .
yesterday , i also pointed out [P_92] for both weakness and a [P_94] reversal [P_95] got that weakness early in the week .
[P_90] it , so now i have [P_92] for a [P_94] .
the arms index went out at 2.53 today , and i 've learned from [P_94] at least a one day bounce when that happens .
mutual funds do n't have that much cash on hand , either , and if redemptions begin to rise , they [P_97] in deep trouble .

[P_90] , i [P_91] to sit down with lindy and a few folks from our group who have [P_97] at this .
i [P_90] it [P_92] an efficient use of [P_94] and that [P_95] not [P_96] duplicating anything .
i [P_90] lindy [P_91] so we [P_92] something up and then [P_94] as necessary .
- i worked it out so [P_92] the lowest [P_94] rate for my time ,
i [P_90] engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ( $ 21k ) .
i [P_90] it [P_92] less time but the 120 hours provides some flexibility if we decide to go deeper on something -- [P_98] only charge [P_910] the hours we use .
to the extent time allows , i [P_92] negotiate and close whatever option you choose .
in order [P_90] our preferred rate , it is important to [P_94] i [P_95] to [P_96] to do [P_98] on [P_99] a [P_910] basis ( e.g. friday meetings , emails , and phone vs. being on - site 3 weeks full - time ) .
even with this [P_91] structure , i [P_92] have the deliverable complete by mid december .

steve , if you [P_91] in this idea i [P_93] drawing up a workplan for this study .
if [P_90] is available i [P_92] by [P_93] mid - [P_94] later [P_95] discussing with them .
on the administrative side , i am [P_92] nail down the lowest hourly rate i [P_95] .

i am currently pursuing another [P_91] ben asante , so i am around the enron building .
[P_90] to [P_93] .
[P_90] so muck [P_91] > them .....
i2 expressed considerable [P_91] below the executive level , but enw had difficulty getting a concrete bid or proposal from i2 .
i2 's response to the enron offer was that they considered it high and that they [P_95] with enron in some manner in [P_98] some form [P_910] .
since those early discussions with i2 , enw has discussed the enrononline [P_94] with other selected technology companies , and is now considering bids from several [P_98] counterparties .
generally speaking the [P_91] that appears to [P_92] best [P_93] both parties entails involvement by enw after the transaction , in the form of equity participation or royalty payments [P_910] , as well as the transfer of some enron people .
this seems [P_90] us into the realm of a " partnership " structure [P_94] i2 interest .
[P_90] to [P_91] we give i2 the [P_93] outline a [P_94] a price as well as outline [P_97] for a relationship [P_98] , or [P_910] that they are not [P_912] .
enron remains [P_90] exploring [P_91] with i2 [P_93] is a genuine interest from i2 . 2 .

el paso says it 's open to expansion of system el paso natural gas " is willing [P_95] its system " to the california border if " sufficient support " for such a project [P_911] demonstrated through long - term capacity contracts , the pipeline told ferc .
the pipeline 's comments were in response to a commission inquiry asking el paso to consider [P_95] of upgrading its proposed line 2000 crude - oil conversion [P_99] a system [P_910] ease the pipeline capacity crunch in the west .
daniel m. adamson , director of ferc 's office of energy [P_93] , raised the prospect in a jan. 3 letter to el paso , saying that modifying [P_99] " could [P_910] difficult situation " now facing the california gas market .
el paso proposed the line 2000 [P_92] as a [P_93] line to replace existing compression , and not as a system [P_97] .
however , " there are several [P_92] , " wrote el paso vice president al clark on jan. 15 .
el paso [P_90] compression to the proposed line 2000 project , or [P_94] replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon in place .
as a third option , he said el paso [P_93] compression to its existing system or [P_96] either [P_96] system or line 2000 project .
the " preferable method [P_91] to be determined by a careful analysis of the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity , i.e. where they [P_910] to put gas into el paso 's system and where they [P_914] gas delivered , " clark said .
as a " first step " towards gauging market support for [P_93] , he noted that el paso on jan. 12 posted 1.2 bcf / d of california - bound pipeline [P_910] sale effective june 1 of this year .
when the posting results are known , " el paso [P_93] whether another [P_94] is needed to solicit expressions of [P_97] pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of california .
if el paso finds there is an " unmet demand [P_93] capacity " on its system , the pipeline at that time " will [P_98] whether [P_99] of the existing system or a modification of the line 2000 project , [P_914] , is the appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion , " clark noted .
not only will the project " increase the operational flexibility " of el paso 's current system , but converting the line from oil to gas service [P_99] a " necessary prerequisite " to any future [P_912] the pipeline 's system , according to clark .

for just over a year now , we have [P_93] with multiple areas within ees [P_95] opportunities on two fronts : 1 ) transferring ees 's weather exposure into the weather [P_911] place and 2 ) developing products for ees [P_914] to its clients and/or that allow ees to bid more aggressively .
we [P_90] excited about [P_91] that have taken place at ees and are hopeful that we [P_96] begin a mutually [P_97] relationship .
the harrah 's [P_91] originated by ken rubeli appears to have the most immediate [P_94] ees client with a weather hedge .
our currently [P_90] there has done extremely well [P_93] will be capping out on those positions shortly .

although hydro output has kept pace with demand and reservoir water levels continue to rise , the increase is much slower than historical [P_97] season buildups .
brazil is expected to [P_91] 1,200 megawatt ( mw ) of [P_93] thermal capacity in 2000 , as well as a [P_97] 1,309 mw of nuclear capacity when the angra ii unit enters commercial operation .
[P_90] capacity [P_91] meet [P_92] increase in demand growth as brazil 's economy strengthens throughout the [P_96] will do little to mitigate power shortages if the current rainfall is insufficient to replenish brazil 's reservoirs .
this recovery was enough to bring year - to - date power demand into [P_94] growth [P_95] the first time , increasing 0.5 percent over j !
october and november brought the strongest growth to the paper , beverage , and transportation materials sectors , supported by [P_96] prices [P_97] markets and the [P_99] of the summer .
in recent months , however , there has been a slow but steady growth in industrial output , led by a recovery [P_97] markets for export [P_99] an improvement in the economic situation .
this growth is expected to continue in [P_92] months as brazil 's economy continues to strengthen .
even [P_90] growth is due entirely to [P_92] of [P_93] billable customers , which [P_95] the customer base by 4.6 percent in the 12 months ending in november 1999 .
increasing electricity intensity of [P_91] has also played a role , [P_94] businesses have greater electricity needs than their predecessors .
in the interim , thermal generation will remain higher than historical averages [P_94] units , including cuiaba and angra ii , [P_97] increase thermal power [P_99] the total generation mix .
this combination of demand growth and uncertain water supply will [P_93] increase the pressure [P_94] generation capacity .
many risks and uncertainties remain , however , limiting any project 's [P_94] reach financial closure .
the continued [P_90] moving [P_91] , [P_92] one to two years of construction once [P_96] are made viable , will [P_98] tighten brazil 's supply - demand balance in [P_911] year , regardless of the availability of water .

a way for enron alumni to [P_92] .
given the current events of the last several years regarding power generation and delivery across our nation , i have a proposal , i 'm [P_98] interest you .
it appears that there are vast opportunities [P_92] an aggressive , first mover organization which [P_95] the resources , and bring all the players [P_99] along with the capital markets to initiate , [P_912] build [P_913] capacity or to enhance the existing power delivery and transfer .
[P_90] transmission capacity must [P_91] , including additional interconnects between the various grids and/or existed interconnects strengthened .
the ability to transfer power from [P_92] coast to the west coast , as the power demand peak moves across the country from [P_98] , or the [P_99] to transfer power from such area 's as nova scotia which has an abundant supply of inexpensive hydro power [P_916] the ideal situation .
what i propose , is [P_91] of a [P_93] enron company , of which its vision [P_95] to identify and [P_97] opportunities to build various transmission assets , and/or [P_910] generation capacity or to strengthen existing assets .
[P_90] be [P_91] by bringing various players [P_92] under the enron lead , [P_94] with the capital markets [P_96] a strategy , allowing for the [P_99] .
this capacity [P_90] then be traded or used for power transfers from regions with inexpensive supplies to [P_95] shortages exist .

a free [P_90] a [P_91] season [P_92]
since the beginning of winter the pacific northwest has received normal precipitation , with greater snowpacks in the northern part of [P_97] than in the southern part .
given current conditions , it [P_91] that california will end winter at [P_94] - average hydroelectric conditions .
because of this high concentration of facilities , above - average precipitation in the pacific northwest [P_95] to offset below - average precipitation in california and other parts of the west , although transfer capabilities limit the amount of energy exported from those regions .
normal hydroelectric generation this [P_91] bring a 250 mmcf per day increase in western gas demand for power generation during the first quarter .
this modest demand increase [P_91] support prices in the western markets , with regional weather differences contributing to western strength as well .
however , with normal weather in the west , that general weakening in western prices [P_95] take place toward the end of february and into march .
expected lower storage inventories in california relative to last year , as well as a low upside to eastern prices , should keep topock prices from falling more than $ 0.05 per mmbtu [P_911] the henry hub during february .
although february [P_90] bring a decline in heating load in both the pacific northwest and california regions , gas [P_96] some support from decreased hydroelectric generation relative to last year in california .
it seems that [P_91] do need to assign the agreements .

note : this interview with jack crawford of alliance is probably the best [P_94] have gained on the pipeline operational [P_97] and [P_98] information .
the last time we did this the forecasts we got suggested that we 'd [P_94] at about 1.325 bcf on the first day .
one of the key questions remaining is whether alliance 's main downstream supply outlet , the 270-mile vector pipeline project , [P_97] to go as well on dec. 1 .
the pipeline [P_90] transport 700 mmcf / d of gas initially from joliet , il , through indiana and michigan to dawn , on , [P_98] to 1 bcf / d [P_911] november .
it 's been a challenge for them to get going , but [P_94] they are all [P_96] go .
a vector spokesman confirmed that commissioning is going smoothly [P_93] appear to [P_94] schedule for dec. 1 [P_96] - up .
[P_90] again next week [P_93] how [P_94] , but right now [P_96] 're getting things pretty well wrapped up .
the last place where we 've been [P_92] has been up in the milford and highland townships in oakland county , mi .
once the massive [P_91] is running smoothly , the [P_93] to be taken include [P_95] connections with several proposed pipelines in and around chicago , including potentially the guardian , horizon and whitecap energy projects .
we 've obviously talked about a potential [P_92] , but [P_94] found out by talking to people [P_97] like the supply [P_98] in the western canadian sedimentary basin have not been as brisk as [P_913] have thought , probably because of the downturn in the oil price a couple of years ago .
it 's likely that [P_91] delayed for a year or two or even three .
the best that i 've [P_91] to ascertain from talking to people is that our supply deliverability really has not increased [P_97] in the last two to three years , and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our system will end up coming out of other systems .

dear mr. jeffrey skilling , it is [P_92] and a grand sense of history that we write to [P_96] that you have been nominated for the 2001 world technology award for commerce .
this year not only [P_91] having the second awards ceremony on the evening of this coming july 2nd at the national museum of science & industry here in central london , [P_910] the first world technology summit [P_914] door on the campus of imperial college of science , technology & industry on july 1st and 2nd .
< < < < < [P_91] enormously to [P_93] the world technology summit .
wtn is a global association of some of the most important [P_93] people in the technology world , focused [P_96] a wide range of [P_98] ( info .
tech . , biotech / medical , [P_92] materials , energy , communications , and [P_95] - related technologies , etc . ) happen sooner and [P_98] than they might have otherwise .
we are identifying the people who [P_92] play a key role in the technological drama over [P_95] years and decades and bringing them [P_98] create [P_99] that will accelerate the application of these technologies .
we are trying to increase the chances of the ' [P_93] accidents ' which can occur when cutting - edge [P_96] , entrepreneurial people , and institutions with vision collide to create innovation .
the world technology summit is an historic two - day gathering ( july 1/2 , 2001 ) of several hundred of the world 's key technology players - scientists , technologists , entrepreneurs , industrialists , financiers , journalists , and policy - makers - [P_915] and catalyse the emerging technologies [P_917] have the greatest [P_919] upon industry and society in [P_920] century and to create the relationships [P_920] those [P_920] the companies behind them [P_920] .
the summit brings [P_91] network members , fellows and other specially invited delegates [P_94] deeply about emerging technologies - how they [P_97] impact [P_98] today 's industries and those industries yet to [P_911] born .
the last evening of the summit [P_92] capped by a gala ceremony during which [P_95] present the second annual world technology awards , recognising those involved in technology who are taking the actions and making the decisions with the greatest likely long - term [P_915] business and society .
the [P_90] wing is the largest museum facility in the world devoted [P_94] it 's a wonderfully appropriate site to recognise history in the making .
an interactive exhibit is also being developed [P_92] thousands of museum visitors to vote and comment on finalists for the world technology awards during the week leading up to the awards on the evening of july 2nd .
keynote speakers [P_90] a visionary [P_92] the interacting roles of technology and business .
session speakers [P_90] their own particular specialty .
the world technology summit is a gathering where all participants are [P_93] with a crucial role to play in the unfolding drama of technology .
sessions [P_90] on a [P_91] goals -- providing a [P_93] grounding in all six of the major emerging tech .
areas ; on [P_91] participants ; and , on developing new [P_94] new businesses , new corporate initiatives , [P_97] partnerships , and even [P_99] industries .
each roundtable [P_90] include an assortment of top - level [P_93] given a topic / field in which [P_97] .
p&l. i will describe the complete process in an email in the [P_94] days .
i [P_90] revise sa reporting , specifically : - break out an origination line - [P_95] copel mtm below the line - [P_97] process of calculating p&l [P_99] by trader ees
i [P_90] the latest one to you [P_92] and [P_93] comment / critique it .
i plan [P_90] at least partial days from home until the baby arrives , monitoring e - mail [P_96] on a [P_97] ongoing [P_98] , and [P_99] reachable at [P_910] .
if a candidate [P_91] ca n't win in ca , then a total gop abandonment of the state should be imposed for [P_97] millennium .
nonetheless , in certain cases i thought it made sense [P_93] specific contract language on some of the [P_97] discussed so that [P_98] clearly [P_99] be proposing on a particular item .
i know that you expressed some reservations the other evening that this process potentially [P_94] subject to some manipulation .
the draft provides [P_91] city , although enron is open to other [P_94] locations .
--the revised draft reflects only the $ 127/mwh alternative scenario since you indicated that , preliminarily , you felt that cdwr would not be likely to choose the alternative structure we [P_910] .
--we [P_90] effect of an adverse federal regulatory change .
i 'm [P_90] can [P_91] light of the current environment , [P_94] that freely negotiated bilateral contracts would not be subject to the types [P_910] being discussed .
enron is not seeking a termination right with lds , [P_93] a termination right without compensation in [P_97] of a major adverse federal [P_99] affecting the contract .
however , we think it is appropriate that if that circumstance occurs , that [P_94] date for payments by cdwr should [P_97] to 7 days and if the bonds are subsequently upgraded that the payment schedule [P_912] revert accordingly .
as we discussed , it [P_91] very [P_92] the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected that [P_97] already [P_98] the limit of its overall exposure with those counter parties .
--in light of [P_91] about opinions not being provided by outside counsel , we modified [P_95] to request that the opinions [P_97] from the ag , or if cdwr can not do that , then from the gc of cdwr .
we felt that this would not involve additional work since these presumably [P_94] rendered in connection with the bonds and we provided that they generally [P_98] provided to us after the bonds are issued .
also , it [P_91] make sense for [P_92] call to have [P_94] enron and cdwr commercial [P_96] the call since [P_97] be the case that many of the final decisions involved [P_911] commercial ones .
thus , it [P_91] that [P_92] have [P_93] modifications or [P_94] the documents .
[P_90] finalize the requisite documents .
as iso [P_90] is a key regulatory concern of theirs , and i do not want [P_96] this until i understand enron 's position .
[P_90] tana , i [P_91] to make the death by chocolate if no one has taken it yet .
[P_90] directions , [P_92] have no problems .
we had to [P_91] .
i would not want [P_91] either unless you are a " sponsor " and believe such tools would clearly add value immediately .
- i [P_90] both a brief [P_93] of [P_93] this past week of elaw and evelocity .
, the user are the most [P_92] .
the loading process is fairly [P_91] be implemented within a firm environment .
some of [P_90] that [P_91] the [P_92] is due to be released in a [P_95] early q1 and by the end of 2001 there is the plan to have at least 10 or so practice areas available .
i think the [P_91] , especially in relation to the organization of [P_95] obtain from our outside sources .
[P_90] also complement the website / [P_92] concept we are currently [P_94] make a part of the website / portal [P_97] process .
i [P_90] see , however , what other tools are out there doing the same or similar function .
[P_90] require interfacing with ap and the sap system , but [P_94] .
reports [P_90] generated in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a budget or overall costs for various matters .
in keeping with [P_91] surrounding the technology plan [P_93] ews , as well as similar ideas presented for the corp. portal / website , it makes sense [P_99] at implementing a matter management system of some sort that goes beyond litigation tracking .
whether or not it is evelocity or another comparable [P_93] would require [P_94] research into [P_95] products , but i believe [P_97] while to pursue [P_99] a [P_910] atmosphere .
[P_90] of [P_91] or [P_93] , [P_94] .
[P_90] , pat and i were thinking it [P_92] have a wedding shower bbq for alice and jeff .
currently , enrononline can only send one [P_92] & end date per deal therefore [P_94] fail in the bridge monitor [P_97] have to be manually entered [P_99] & subsequently cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions [P_91] flow [P_91] day , it is imperative that these transactions get into sitara [P_95] .
we do [P_90] a large volume of these transactions [P_93] to [P_94] to react quickly when they do .
for [P_90] , we [P_91] into the cost / [P_93] enrononline having the [P_95] of sending multiple dates for these types of products .

[P_90] the delayed response , however , i was not in [P_94] last week .

[P_90] want [P_91] into our companion site , designstand .
can [P_90] verify who is correct , and if enron 's rate is correct , [P_95] for 8/01 , 9/01 and the continuing months in the deal ?
if we are correct , [P_91] talk to your counterpart at enron [P_94] about [P_95] resolved this month ?
( [P_90] try [P_91] a one day reservation for all the speakers [P_94] case , but are not sure which [P_97] tostay longer --so we ned to [P_912] precise plans to avoid booking confusion ) .
i [P_90] the bobcats to bounce back with a strong effort here at home , where they are 14 - 7 ats the last 5 years and 8 - 1 straight up recently .
i 'll [P_90] another [P_91] upset here as the irish continue to be overrated .
notre dame has an outstanding defensive front and they should have their way with an inexperienced michigan state offensive line with 4 [P_97] starters .
the spartans , meanwhile , qualify in a 95 - 38 - 3 ats road underdog situation that won for me in a best [P_98] utah at oregon two weeks ago , and they also qualify in a 48 - 16 ats [P_914] road underdog situation that is 17 - 2 ats the last 5 years .
with those angles qualifying , i 'll call for an even [P_93] margin than my ratings [P_95] make the spartans a best [P_97] .
the demon deacons ' veterans [P_91] into grobe 's demanding [P_93] ethic and [P_94] are a 2 - 0 [P_97] that includes an [P_98] road win at east carolina ( a probable bowl team ) in which the deacons out - gained the pirates 451 yards to 294 yards .
wake forest has more talent than is indicated by last year 's 2 - 9 record and [P_95] jim grobe has started to get this [P_99] play to their potential .
wake forest , meanwhile , qualifies in a 46 - 14 - 2 ats [P_94] home underdog situation that has been very [P_97] me over the years .
while [P_90] these [P_91] vastly [P_92] with their [P_93] coaches , it [P_94] if wake forest is more improved and a bit underrated .
with that being the case and [P_92] situations supporting the demon deacons as well , i will call for the upset .
while i respect north carolina 's defense and usually [P_93] take big home underdogs with a strong stop unit , i will side with the seminoles in this game on the basis of a 126 - 58- 1 ats statistical indicator .
it [P_90] if those pointspread results have given us line value on the side of the bulls in this game and teams that start out [P_98] 0 - 2
buffalo is just 4 - 8 ats on the road since they became a division 1a team 3 years ago , so i [P_97] hold off [P_98] a play on them here despite the [P_911] value and [P_912] situation .
fresno state has opened [P_91] with 3 straight upset wins and [P_94] that [P_95] be a letdown spot for them .
however , teams that [P_91] season 3 - 0 straight up are actually [P_94] plays as road favorites in game 4 and fresno is as good as they 've shown in beating [P_911] bowl teams colorado , oregon state and wisconsin .
tulsa should [P_90] the air with talented 3rd year starter josh blankenship throwing to a good corps of receivers .
things [P_90] pretty competitive in this game as tulsa was 5 - 1 ats at home last year while fresno is just 2 - 9 ats as a road favorite since ' 94 , including 0 - 4 ats the last 2 years .
[P_90] another big win for the buffaloes .
smu returns 18 starters from last year 's 3 - 9 team and i expected them to be [P_96] sides of the ball .
nc state [P_90] an impressive 35 - 14 win over indiana and their offense [P_95] a bit better than it was a year ago .
smu does qualify in a couple of strong [P_92] , a 31 - 8 ats underdog bounce - back situation and a 46 - 14 - 2 ats home underdog angle , so i [P_912] a couple of points to their total .
and they may [P_91] 's big game with rival north carolina .
was asking if it is appropriate to use a set [P_93] corresponding to some commodity for another commodity .
i [P_90] using this kind of mappings [P_92] because [P_93] not trust these correlations based on illiquid price information .
[P_90] believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 [P_98] - then [P_99] use more [P_910]
so if we believe that the [P_92] prices for this commodity are market prices and statistical [P_95] these prices produces the correlations which we trust , then [P_99] proper to use this correlation matrix in var engine , not the factors .
using [P_90] is simply the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without sacrificing the accuracy .
i agree that [P_91] be using this calculation [P_93] all commodity vars .
[P_90] of correlation [P_91]
i [P_90] factor loadings should be calculated , on the same data sets used for inter commodity correlation , for all commodities .
to ensure this [P_91] i think a list of the mile stones , responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up
we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the best [P_93] this time .
hence ( 1 ) [P_91] risktrac [P_93] var , as it is the " most accurate " , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most recent updated data .

judge smith gave a brief [P_91] the parties ' opposing positions on the scope of permissible jurisdiction discovery - the defendants limiting that scope to " contacts " and the plaintiffs treating it as tantamount to merits discovery .
i left the courtroom [P_91] how smith [P_92] which [P_93] he thinks are within and without the limited personal jurisdiction discovery the cmo allows .
the court finally realized that the defendants were concerned he [P_93] ruling to compel discovery without having considered the various objections , and so made clear he is only going to now [P_911] sharp 's questions , give some [P_913] which [P_914] seem within the scope of the order , and the defendants [P_918] objections [P_919] .
i [P_90] both sides will wait to [P_92] the judge says about the scope of " limited personal jurisdiction discovery , " then re - [P_98] how [P_99] with cmo negotiations .

while the parties .. [P_91] disagree over the appropriate methodology to price icap deficiencies , the underlying objective should be clear , i.e. , an icap deficiency charge [P_99] motivate participants to secure sufficient icap , to [P_912] generation , and to [P_914] generation to others .

if [P_90] further [P_91] the theoretical underpinnings , [P_93] .
similarly , [P_90] does currently have weather exposure in japan and , accordingly , can not be said to be hedging weather risk .
we understand that [P_91] 's business purposes allow enron japan to engage in weather derivative transaction .
we also note that the financial law board ( paper on derivatives transactions and gambling , issued on november 29 , 1999 ; the financial law board is an unofficial organisation of legal practitioners ) has stated that a company that enters into derivative transactions as a [P_915] be [P_916] argue that it has a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transactions - particularly where the parties to the transaction are sophisticated and the transactions are conducted within reasonable parameters .
based on [P_90] , [P_91] that enron japan [P_93] give both representations .
we understand that the fsa has provided [P_92] to certain financial institutions to the effect that the provisions allowing financial institutions to enter into financial derivatives are wide enough to also allow financial institutions to [P_912] weather derivatives .
however , this is a matter that toare [P_92] to confirm with the fsa directly , and we are [P_96] to express a general view - all that is [P_910] is for [P_911] to request the representation from toa re .
[P_90] , assuming that toare [P_91] to give the representations referred to above , and that these representations are correct , both paragraph ( a ) [P_99] ( b ) appear to apply .
thus , we do not believe that the risk for enron [P_93] in entering into this transactions with toare [P_96] any higher than would have been the case if [P_910] had entered into the transaction with a legitimate end user ( for example an air conditioning company ) .
it is conceivable that enron [P_91] may , in [P_93] , enter into transactions with entities that are neither financial institutions nor end users ( for example , other traders like enron itself [P_911] fall into this category ) .
in our view , the risk for [P_92] in this scenario would increase , [P_95] still be characterised as being " [P_97] low " .
in this situation , [P_91] and the counterparty [P_93] give mutual representations to the effect of the representation set out in paragraph ( a ) under question 1 above .
the representations previously proposed were proposed on the basis that the [P_93] be an end user .
if appropriate , [P_91] to [P_92] alternate forms of representations [P_94] reference .
dear jeremy , pls see [P_91] information my email to alan , mark and alan .
i think the answer to question 1 - [P_92] can give the warranty - has got to be no .
dear alan and mark , i am going to [P_93] me make a risk decision .
i [P_90] mark evans but he [P_92] leaving this up to alan and mark because alan and mark have been involved in this gambling issue from the beginning .
- given that our legal situation is grey at best , i do not [P_94] should [P_95] the warranty they have requested .
dear jeremy , i [P_91] to refine the following instructions .
have we already had any written advice [P_92] on whether [P_93] can warrant [P_95] lines ?
they are insisting they not give ( ii ) and that we [P_94] with ( iii ) only for the purposes of the gambling law pls confirm in writing whether you [P_910] can still go ahead on this basis .
rodney , from what you told me [P_92] like ge is willing to play on the selkirk asset so the sales cycle should [P_98] largely [P_98] .
, i 'll give you a response with the [P_93] that would change my mind .
however < [P_90] exenuating circumstances [P_92] feel [P_93] this at all costs , there are values not being calculated that the client would recognize , there are senior execs at ge plastics behind this [P_913] a way to close this , or [P_916] that is convincing [P_918] origination team that they have a winner here ....
if it was to put more [P_92] on it to [P_93] go up , i 'll be [P_97] .

given that we have worked closely with minton 's , underwriters ' representatives , i [P_95] that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a total quantum before the joint survey takes place ; in fact , [P_913] like the final determination of ect 's total quantum of damages [P_917] impacted by the results of the joint survey ( although i [P_920] not necessarily [P_920] say that to underwriters at this point ) .

the [P_90] results we have to date of the thai cargo are somewhat inconclusive , but indicate lead and vanadium [P_96] off spec , but principal reason for not delivering to first gas is uncertainty of d3605 as a test method .
- thailnd shoretank samples brought to caleb brett singapore tested on spec , but note different [P_95] method used ( d5184/5185 ) .
certainly sufficient [P_90] the best [P_92] establishing the cause .
to that end , i [P_91] that [P_92] the other parties with the test methods ( astm d - numbers ) and state that these tests will be applied to retain samples from each of : 1 .
that might [P_90] the investigation some testing [P_92] involve composites , some individual samples .
this will to a degree [P_91] on the lab 's [P_93] get any particulates into homogeneous suspension and keep them there long enough [P_98] a composite .
insofar as identifying the particulates , should this prove necessary , i [P_94] to keep all options open .
while it is always [P_91] to perform unilateral analysis should disagreements arise , [P_94] to keep the parties [P_96] .
but [P_90] limit at the beginning the potential extent of testing that might be necessary , it [P_96] prove meaningless .

the proposal advanced by the distribution cooperatives [P_92] to create a [P_94] to market electric power to retail customers throughout arkansas .
if a distribution cooperative decides to withdraw from the [P_93] , [P_94] compete with the joint [P_96] for any and all consumers .
each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric power generating capacity in arkansas , and the combined generating power capacity of the 17 distribution cooperatives is approximately 6 percent of the total generating capacity in the two areas of arkansas in which the joint [P_915] is likely to market .
the joint venture is expected to achieve economies of scale that would give it [P_94] distribution costs in statewide or [P_97] than would be attainable by individual members .
he commented that " while the distribution cooperatives [P_92] viewed [P_93] entrants into each other 's local retail markets , regional markets and a state - wide market , their small [P_911] relatively high operating costs [P_913] unlikely that they [P_914] markets on their own or that , if they tried to enter , they would [P_920] effective competition .

it 's a very [P_91] market , and there 's a lot of competition with inexpensive products coming from abroad .

that is because the puc has yet to [P_92] much pg&e [P_94] earn on electricity generated at the plants it still owns .

[P_90] before most californians knew a long - term energy crisis loomed , the economic development corporation of shasta county , which seeks to attract business and the wealth it generates , began to aggressively pursue [P_912] midsize bay area manufacturing businesses [P_914] and relocate .
in the shasta county - area workforce of 84,000 ( 71,600 in shasta and another 12,400 in tehama county ) , a consultant 's survey has identified 18,000 underemployed workers who have [P_910] , education [P_912] that qualify them for a [P_914] , said zauher .

and duke said that if the governor helped speed up permits , the company could [P_95] enough new portable units to power [P_97] 500,000 homes .
davis spokesman steve maviglio said at the time the [P_93] was made , duke 's proposal was expensive and there was uncertainty about how the energy crisis would take [P_99] .
had the governor decided [P_91] duke get permits for the [P_93] " peaker plants , " he [P_96] already be halfway to his goal of getting 1,000 megawatts worth of new peaker plants by this summer .
moreover , williams and others said it [P_92] for energy companies to meet davis ' goal of 1,000 megawatts [P_97] peaker power plants by summer because , even under a [P_911] speedy permitting process [P_912] davis three weeks ago , it still [P_915] months to line up equipment and get it constructed and on line .
the dilemma for california this summer [P_92] up like this : various estimates [P_94] that the amount of electricity [P_96] will fall short of demand by 5,000 megawatts to nearly 7,000 megawatts , or enough electricity to power 5 million to 7 million homes .
and even with a speedier licensing process , it [P_93] difficult to get the other 1,000 megawatts of [P_96] peakers built in time [P_98] .
still , state officials [P_91] that the governor 's goals to boost power production from peaker plants and through increased energy conservation [P_97] .
with increased generation and the reduction in demand , [P_93] to avoid rolling blackouts this summer , " said energy commission spokeswoman claudia chandler .
chandler said [P_90] peaker plants , which [P_92] transported on a flatbed truck [P_95] small as a large backyard storage shed , still [P_99] running by summer if applications are filed by mid - april .

under a settlement announced monday , the water resources department will buy power on behalf of residential and business customers that was previously being delivered to edison and pg&amp;e. ` ` we see this as [P_911] .

' ' energy department spokesman joe davis said abraham is [P_93] the proposal [P_94] n't comment on whether he would endorse it .

it presumes that generation owners [P_91] on violating the pre - existing screens and counting on the revenue from those " golden eggs .
generators are not limited [P_91] revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in the bilateral market .
one generation owner did a relatively " [P_92] " job selling a [P_94] energy contract for the 6 month procurement period while the other owner did a relatively " poor " job selling a similar contract .
in the icap auctions they both [P_92] the same strategy - [P_94] revenue that each of them [P_96] out of [P_97] auction .
this is not a significant change to the existing rules [P_93] seem unlikely [P_94] a [P_96] change in [P_97] energy revenue or the underlying value of [P_910] product . " ... [P_912] uncertainty to [P_913] york market ...
i am not passing judgment at this stage , [P_93] that all parties should know that the prices that were posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent [P_910] be required to some or all of the months .
whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the amp , i believe that it is most appropriate for the mmu to take immediate action and refer it to the committees for [P_913] resolution .
since last summer there have been very significant > [P_93] in the [P_94] affect [P_95] markets [P_96] .

for > external suppliers [P_91] bid is based upon [P_93] cost of being > obligated to [P_96] york energy market rather than being either obligated > to another market or having no obligations to any market .
clearly , in each case , the bid into the capacity market [P_94] upon > the expectations of [P_96] energy market .
there have been several > adopted [P_92] changes in [P_93] york energy markets that make them > both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy > markets surrounding [P_911] .

the implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns > that the market prices [P_94] york energy price [P_96] depressed .

incidentally - with respect to the eta - it seems to [P_93] that [P_94] gtc 's [P_95] in respect of a transaction if an isda is not in place on the trade date of such transaction , however it does not seem [P_914] any provision for circumstances where [P_917] / master agreement is entered into subsequent to the execution of a transaction .
in such circumstances on a literal interpretation of the eta , the pre - existing transaction would continued to be governed by the gtc but [P_98] transactions [P_99] governed by the isda / master agreement .

- federal reserve bank of [P_91] president william mcdonough said on thursday the international financial system is showing some signs of strain from a slowdown in global growth .
[P_90] york fed chief did not comment further on the global economy or [P_94] u.s. economy in the speech , which focused on global financial stability .
he advocated a [P_91] case - by - case approach to crisis management , adding that regulators should [P_96] for minimalist intervention .
speaking may 3 in frankfurt , germany , mcdonough said bank supervisors around the world should [P_95] to [P_96] banks [P_97] manage their businesses and their risks .
if history is any guide , " he said , " [P_93] in markets and practices quickly will render obsolete those measures that might seem well attuned to today 's circumstances .
mcdonough said that approach , in his opinion , [P_93] investors skittish and [P_94] it harder to generate support for honoring contractual commitments .
[P_90] up , i believe the one [P_92] fits all disposition inherent in the standstills approach risks making situations much worse than they [P_98] be , " he said .
just as bailouts [P_91] encourage too much risk taking , efforts to orchestrate preemptive bail - ins [P_95] encourage too little .
as [P_90] market is becoming more sophisticated and [P_93] , and as consumer issues [P_95] more to the fore , it is timely to consider whether the current arrangements in hong kong remain appropriate , " it said . .
the oecd report says japan [P_91] to bail out the banks , a [P_94] government has ruled out .
[P_90] loan clean - [P_91] be a huge task for the authorities , in particular as flagging confidence [P_96] dictate that [P_97] have to be carried out in a short period of time , " it says .
[P_90] also fuel japan 's spiraling debt burden which is projected to hit 158 per cent of gdp in 2006 - and 138 per cent [P_98] .

if acceptable to you , i will [P_92] to the agreement as agreed [P_95] same to [P_96] final review in anticipation of a draft of the guaranty .
the way forward dan , in response [P_92] question yesterday , it should still [P_95] to get a structural ruling from the irs along the lines that deutschebank ( db ) had contemplated .
i doubt it , but if not , [P_92] to [P_93] that we [P_95] on [P_96] about other ways to do a coal deal with pacificorp .
we [P_90] to [P_91] in terms of what the landscape [P_93] in the absence of getting a new ruling .
one [P_90] follow through with our [P_93] pacificorp 's facilties , meaning [P_95] relocate them , and continue running run - of - mine coal , the irs be damned , and just [P_912] equity player with a greater risk profile than pacificorp .
in short , [P_91] companies who are willing to rely on pacificorp 's [P_95] rulings , period ( along with an appropriate indemnity ) .
[P_90] , the irs announcement does not require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output , as some commontators had feared , which is a [P_99] development because the pelletizing process [P_911] a tremendous drag on capacity .
however , there are real [P_91] .
it seems to me that if they [P_92] persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of [P_96] landscape , since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk , then [P_912] still have an [P_914] do a synfuel deal .

the commission has classified the investigation as a ratesetting proceeding and ordered the three?utilities to file a cost / [P_96] upgrades as well as their own [P_910] peaking generation [P_912] summer .
the cpuc has authority over utilities , but cal - iso is the agency that is approving transmission upgrades to [P_96] by utilities and complementary [P_98] to [P_99] by market forces to hook into that transmission .
although the cpuc has not stepped fully into [P_92] generation siting process -- so far , a procedure that has been up to cal - iso and the california energy commission -- it does [P_911] transmission inquisition as a foundation to question both transmission and generation [P_916] .

the agreement includes endesa 's right to increase its [P_93] snet in the [P_94] in order to strengthen the cooperation between [P_97] and allow endesa to carry out its industrial [P_911] plan in france and europe .
[P_90] for endesa to acquire 30-percent [P_92] snet cements the company 's [P_94] into france , which is a major component in the aggressive [P_98] efforts endesa has been implementing this year .
endesa was [P_90] beat out other bidders for snet , including france 's suez lyonnaise des eaux and germany 's rwe , due to the [P_98] valuation of endesa 's industrial and commercial [P_911] the economic value of its [P_913] .
ironically , [P_90] benefit repsol as the company plans to invest in any companies that are divested due to the merger .
however , even though endesa [P_91] face [P_92] limitations in france , it is important to remember how large the company is in its home country .
thus , although france is [P_91] for endesa 's european [P_93] efforts , the company is still a contender in [P_97] markets .

the deliverables here were to ( 1 ) obtain a tariff methodology [P_94] supreme decree that [P_95] the company finance - [P_97]
tariffs approved gentlemen , i am [P_92] to report that sirese approved substantial increases in tr 's tariffs consistent with the law and regulation .
[P_90] rate - we 'll get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used .
[P_90] exactly what has been removed , but my thought is that if that means we are unable to [P_97] services ( e.g. [P_99] transportation ) or the continued operation of some liquids laterals , [P_913] write to those producers affected suggesting that if they [P_916] these services to be continued they [P_919] appeal the decision .
again since this is capex [P_91] get it back in the end on tariff [P_95] as long as the expenditure is [P_97] an annual basis in the sirese budget process .
[P_90] to do a detailed study [P_92] an occ strategy .
we intend to fight this one very hard using all the external / independant [P_94] get .
as you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the [P_95] substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and [P_99] be subjected to some form of arbitary cut .
having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as [P_95] from [P_96] strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts [P_910] much [P_911] and hence managable increases .

- i [P_90] should broaden the tax [P_92] offload responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the equipment , not just the sale .
i believe [P_90] be a teh responsibility .
creditworthiness - [P_90] have an issue here .
[P_90] specifiy that [P_91] from a credit worthy entity , or guaranteed by a credit worthy entity .
[P_90] to issue [P_92] .
[P_90] each utility on a case by case basis and decide whether or not [P_95] to include the surcharge in the price to beat ( ptb ) period starting january 1 , 2002 .

[P_90] wish [P_91] your projected target , [P_93] your human resource representative .
therefore , cash collections as well as individual [P_92] the liquidation process [P_94] adjust , upward or downward , the actual lip payouts to participating employees .
cash collections [P_90] monitored through a weekly dashboard and [P_93] be provided regular status [P_95] .
enron 's reorganization is complete ; [P_92] a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter , but [P_96] has been made , a quarterly advance [P_99] allocated to you based on a quarterly floor amount of $ 1.85 million .
if you are an active employee on the [P_92] milestone date , you are eligible to earn a lip payment based on [P_97] toward the milestone .
your supervisor will communicate your actual incentive amount after a collection milestone is reached or at the end of the quarter and project targets for [P_98] collection milestone or [P_910] quarter .

i feel i [P_91] specific knowledge that , if i do a [P_94] of relaying [P_95] , [P_96] a boost to your effectiveness as you move up and through the organization .
i apologize to [P_91] for not opening up the initial class to more [P_94] first time around .

in [P_90] maintaining and [P_91] its annual dividend of $ 1.34 per share , franklin disclosed that , [P_96] , southern [P_97] implement a [P_99] strategy , which focuses geographically on serving 10 states in the so - called " super southeast .
two recent and significant events at southern company set [P_93] for this pronouncement of a " [P_95] " [P_96] the energy company based in atlanta .
yet now , even as national energy competitors grow [P_93] and [P_93] , southern company 's strong local presence and vertical [P_97] approach [P_97] ultimately prove to be the smartest strategy of all .
the [P_90] unregulated power generation , through which southern reportedly plans [P_94] another 6,000 mw by 2003 , most likely refers to subsidiary operations such as southern nuclear and southern company energy solutions .
this has been a lucrative business [P_92] the company for [P_93] .
the difference now - [P_91] to expanding from four to 10 states in the same region - is that southern may very [P_97] on the right track and [P_910] have the last laugh as the deregulation game continues to unfold .
of course , ferc 's policy is that transmission - owning utilities should " voluntarily " participate in an rto , but at the same time the commission [P_99] have control over southern 's market power in the region should the energy company ever want to merge with or acquire another utility .
the company 's vertically integrated [P_91] has been retained and there have been no indications that southern company faces a supply shortage .
[P_90] markets such as florida and california [P_93] southern 's base , while at the same time the company has held on to its market share in its own region .
for all of [P_91] , southern [P_92] prove to have one of the smartest strategies across the electric utility market .
focusing exclusively on the " super region " of the southeast appears to be providing a remarkable rate - of - [P_97] southern .
while other companies have rushed to merge , grow [P_93] across the country , southern has taken a more methodical approach , [P_98] also get it across the " [P_910] line " before many other competitors .

evergreen plans to begin large - scale manufacturing of its solar power products in a [P_95] manufacturing facility this year .
astropower is reporting continued strong [P_91] the company , and in fact has stated that it has far more sales [P_97] than it can supply .
however , the suddenly strong performance of both evergreen solar and active power - after previous quarters , and even decades , of financial losses - indicates that market [P_99] have [P_910] considerably for companies involved in solar power [P_913] and marketing .
i think there are several [P_91] driving this renewed interest .

he said he was sure the females in [P_92] audience would come [P_94] a similar [P_95] men .
here 's my list , which i [P_92] print in the [P_94] of fairness : ten rules for men 1 .
when you go to the store , ask [P_92] want anything .
we think [P_90] , even when you lose [P_93] hair .
[P_90] not read [P_91] .
[P_90] need our [P_91] buy a [P_92] your secretary or [P_94] a [P_95] mother , [P_97] do n't ask [P_98] the last minute .
[P_90] later , and [P_92] will be a lot [P_94] .
also , i [P_91] to initial the docs where enron is signing .
i [P_90] would show it on exxonkaty , but i ca n't find anything in path manager on exxonkaty or tejas .
" because i knew i [P_91] stay in state and , after visiting a&m and texas ( unofficially ) , i just [P_97] texas better .
both say they are committed , but both [P_92] to [P_93] around a little bit [P_95] if they [P_96] better .
williams probably will wind up [P_91] and smith probably will wind up at texas , but both cases will bear watching right up to and through signing day in february .
the horns have a [P_91] everyone in the top seven on that list - no . 1
that would give the longhorns four straight super classes heading [P_93] season and , for the first time , the oldest group of that foursome [P_98] seniors or juniors who have redshirted .
pickryl also plans to graduate early , so he [P_93] be counted back to last year if he signs with texas .
the number [P_90] on the low side if smith stays solid and pickryl goes alsewhere , but it will rise if smith strays and pickryl comes aboard .
the surgery probably would knock him out of most or all of the contact [P_94] , [P_95] allow him to [P_97] recovered by [P_98] .
we turned the ball over and [P_92] not overcome the adversity we [P_94] ourselves .
we knew [P_90] n't [P_91] to run on colorado , [P_94] knew we had to keep [P_96] .
they did a [P_91] of coming and doing exactly what we were n't [P_94] .
they came out [P_91] to play on both sides of the ball , as well as on special teams .
they also did a [P_91] job in the punt return game .
what that mean is that texas has a [P_92] land one of the four major bcs bowl spots if they take care of business and win their final four games [P_911] the regular [P_912] 10 - 1 .
texas coach mack brown and his longhorns [P_92] that game , but their [P_95] somewhere between very slim and none because oklahoma [P_98] have to lose twice in the regular season for that to happen and then the horns would have to beat the big 12 north winner , probably nebraska .
but , by winning out and finishing 10 - 1 , the longhorns would have a [P_95] play in the sugar bowl [P_98] orleans in the post - season .

[P_90] , i ( and possibly stinson as well ) [P_93] attending this initial meeting [P_95] kick - off type of meeting .
i [P_90] to drill into what they [P_93] offer and what we have committed .
i 'll fire off [P_91] i get them .
i 've attempted to define exactly what problem [P_92] consider [P_93] ietf working group [P_95] .
my summary of [P_91] ietf wgs with interests in metrics is given below ( appendix b ) , but it seems unlikely that [P_98] get a new ietf wg started .
i believe that [P_91] instead run a single caida [P_93] ' network metrics , ' rather than the two proposed earlier .
it focuses on producing educational material about network measurement , and on developing new metrics - these were the two areas of greatest [P_97] amongst the caida members .
[P_90] through revised charter in detail - identify [P_92] required for each part - determine who 's willing [P_96] on it
- summary of metrics used [P_91] services - gather information / [P_94] / emerging services , especially diffserv - based ones - make list of new metrics , either [P_910] measurement of existing services or to support [P_913] ones [ list of ' metrics ' questions ( appendix a ) goes here ]
+ organise experimental implementation / testing of [P_92] new metrics + [P_94] on implementation - define core set of ' really [P_97] ' metrics - [P_99] caida implement these as a ' service measurement toolkit ' + publish new metric definitions through ippm or rtfm + produce document " measurement requirements for hardware / software vendors .
will [P_90] differentiated transport- [P_91] - layer services [P_93] new metrics ?
its primary goal was to produce [P_92] traffic flow measurement [P_93] considering at least the following needs :
these metrics [P_90] designed such that they [P_92] network operators , end users , or independent testing groups .
in short - rtfm provides a [P_92] distributed measuring system for traffic volumes - ippm has concentrated on transport - layer behaviour of the current , best - effort internet .

in short sales , investors borrow shares of a stock and sell them , [P_94] the stock will fall so they [P_97] replace the shares with cheaper ones .
such trades are riskier than buying a company 's shares directly , because if the stock rises strongly , an investor with a short position on the shares [P_99] forced to " cover " the bet at a sky - high cost .
based on information in the article and his general knowledge about how business in brazil worked , he felt that the company 's stock [P_98] fall in price .
he adds that there [P_91] no obvious way for mr. skilling to have gained any [P_95] or valuable knowledge about aes through enron 's dealings with his company .
just accounting for the 600,000 shares he owns outright , the collar proposed by schwab [P_95] saved mr. skilling more than $ 30 million .
interestingly , professional investors often [P_91] to hedge a big positive [P_94] on a company in any given industry by shorting shares of a rival , on the theory that if the entire industry tumbles , the gains on the short sale [P_914] offset the losses on the [P_916] .

i would simply ask [P_91] 's [P_92] take a [P_93] tommorow at valuing the ships as stand alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price movements .
this [P_90] much easier than the rainbow option approach and [P_93] allow us to roughly [P_95] the value of the options on the other two ships .
in other words [P_91] two ship long positions with some implied volatilities and also estimate daily vars on the ships as if they were mark to market ( although i agree [P_911] that [P_912] not [P_913] mark the ships because they [P_916] treated as leases ) .
i would [P_90] to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do power and gas positions .
here is [P_90] make the decision : 1 ) our shipping expert confirms that $ 140 million for a 135,000 [P_97] ship represents a [P_98] price relative to [P_910] build costs over the last three years and that quotes have been [P_914] up past that number recently .
[P_90] and historic analysis [P_91] that the pricing cycle for lng ships lasts for a significant period .
new efficiency measures should reduce [P_91] build prices ( and allow for a lower trough ) , but not by an extreme amount versus the $ 140 million cost of this vessel .
he estimates the ship could be sold in a distressed sale for $ 110 million [P_95] be potentially time chartered on a long term basis at a value of up to $ 200 million .
the plant 's [P_91] and the realities of the lng supply [P_94] require that we commit to gas natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured .
[P_90] , however , [P_91] plant opportunities in spain , and elsewhere in the med region , [P_96] the capacity to utilise these vessels .

we&#39;re [P_90] running out of hotel space , so if you&#39;re [P_93] to do it [P_96] before space runs out .
although there is still much dissension among the ranks of scientists and environmentalists as to [P_95] ghg has on the environment , there [P_98] little doubt the earth&#39;s climate is [P_910] to change because human activities are altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of greenhouse gases ?
few can [P_90] each degree higher or lower than [P_93] temperature , will have on their company&#39;s financial statement .

( if any ) [P_91] approach this not as a single transaction but as a [P_95] , with specific characteristics , without any similar in the market , that enron developed in the us and is trying to " sell " in brazil .
if [P_90] have a brokerage house or bank in the middle [P_94] the contract with the bm&f ( [P_97] ) .

the proposed [P_90] deal with eight major areas [P_92] construction dealing with design , density and [P_95] , but not use , of properties . ?
-- the new restrictions would require that any garage facing the street [P_94] back at least halfway to the back lot line , and in [P_98] be no [P_910] to the street than the front of the house itself .
[P_90] - dominated front -- a [P_92] provision would mandate that a front - facing [P_95] door [P_95] not take up more than a half of the first - floor front of the house , a direct blow at the most common townhome styles . ?
raised foundations -- preserving another dominant characteristic of home [P_93] the heights , the new restrictions would require either pier - and - beam construction , or other foundation construction that would raise the bottom floor of the house at least 2 feet from the ground .
height restrictions -- [P_91] would retain the current height restriction of 40 feet , except that for lots of width greater than 50 feet , the limit would go up [P_910] foot for every 2 feet [P_912] setback from the nearest lot line .
density and lot width -- the minimum lot size would be increased from one residence per every 2,500 [P_96] to one per every 5,000 [P_98] , and there [P_910] a minimum frontage of 50 feet for each lot .
[P_90] essentially establish a minimum lot size of 50 feet by 100 feet .
[P_90] situation , there [P_91] two [P_92] exceptions to [P_93] density and lot width requirements .
second , lots of smaller frontage or size with existing houses as of the date of adoption of [P_96] or other fixed date ( to be determined ) [P_99] " grandfathered .
a bracketed bill enacted by the texas legislature in 1999 , applying only to the heights , created a means by which the deed restrictions [P_98] changed , setting the [P_910] these [P_911] .
adoption of the [P_91] would require an affirmative vote of 75 percent of those submitting a ballot .
second , a petition [P_91] or otherwise sent out to all signed - on owners .
the third , and as tiller pointed out by far the easiest , method [P_94] to call a meeting of signed - on property owners .

i [P_90] generation [P_93] your company .
[P_90] are not in the market for additional capacity i would [P_94] i might [P_96] .
we have a rather strange assortment of equipment to support [P_93] , special hydra lift trailers [P_95] large engine without disassembly , cranes for use in trying areas , high voltage bucket trucks , a portable repair shop [P_913] to a major site that is 100 ft x 60 ft and is fully equipped [P_919] from turbine repairs , installs or [P_920] do a large rewind ..
for off - shore [P_91] have a floating [P_93] , a service vessel that has equipment on - board [P_96] generation or also do similar service and repairs .
sometimes , [P_90] to supplying [P_92] , [P_93] supply used , refurbished or surplus assets .
this is a partial listing so [P_92] your company contacts are in the market [P_95] in particular , [P_97] .
these are [P_90] properties i am [P_92] , we [P_93] turnkey installations all over the world as well as a [P_97] deal of offshore work .
delivery can occur within approximately 120 [P_92] days ( 4 months ) after receipt of funds as specified [P_96] .
a control room [P_91] provided [P_92] switchgear and circuit disconnects .

anything [P_90] , but i [P_92] say not in [P_93] since the original investor deal fell through .
you 'll probably want to be familiar with it [P_93] 're recommending a $ 10mm limit on the regulated portfolio , and it 's losing $ $ $ .
we 're simply imposing a limit on existing risk , but given the [P_94] drop in pge earnings vs. prior year , investor relations is [P_98] some interest and the bod [P_910] aware of it and ask for clarification of our risk management practices [P_915] .
pge expects to meet internal target of $ 110 m for 2001 , based on ytd performance [P_95] adjustment mechanisms , which are being executed for 4q01 and into 2002 .
total costs will rise to $ 325 m , [P_93] potentially expose pge [P_94] .
[P_90] mechanism [P_91] additional features : o a tighter band than the 2001 mechanism o tiers of sharing , with less sharing as the variance between forecasted power costs and actual power costs is larger , [P_912] negative .

this is a test to [P_91] your memory is > working .
with that said , it is probably not necessary to undertake [P_93] for mid - year prc purposes [P_96] are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split [P_910] achieved ( [P_912] - end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt ) .
following my note last [P_91] find attached [P_92] peer group [P_94] for all [P_95] .
we were considering moving to a 3 peer group structure however it as agreed at the last prc committee meeting to [P_97] the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally [P_912] where most activities had been placed with the exception of just 2 or 3 .
it was agreed that [P_91] concentrate on [P_92] these rather than [P_94] an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 peer groups .

the issue is perhaps more a commercial one - [P_93] think carefully about the [P_95] our public betting on the bankruptcy of our counterparties will or might [P_910] our business [P_911] with them .
the proposal needs to be analyzed [P_92] from the [P_93] of three principal regulatory schemes - securities , commodities and insurance .
with respect to the commodity exchange act , if the derivatives are executed as swaps , they [P_95] to satisfy the cftc 's swap exemption and , if executed as options , they [P_911] to satisfy the trade option exemption .
with respect to insurance , [P_91] be an issue as to whether the credit derivatives constitute insurance .
this determination as well [P_91] largely [P_92] the derivatives are structured .
as a result of the foregoing , it [P_92] necessary to obtain [P_94] regarding [P_95] of the proposed transactions .
[P_90] necessary to [P_92] bankruptcy events [P_93] defined .
presumably the definition that is used [P_92] to [P_93] some period in which the proceeding [P_95] dismissed .
also , the definition [P_91] to [P_92] the possibility of non - us bankruptcy proceedings .
we also should obtain [P_91] on the manner in which the derivatives will [P_94] and the manner in which such prices [P_97] published or disseminated to clients .

they were also designed [P_91] the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company 's stock .
joint [P_90] investments l.p. should have been consolidated back onto its books in november 1997 .
they [P_90] been too fancy for their own good .
the [P_90] a global powerhouse , " he said .
government regulators [P_90] have to review a merger , [P_93] too much market concentration would result .
however , i do n't think it 's [P_92] as [P_93] , " he said , adding that a successful merger would take the correct incentives to convince enron 's traders [P_911] for [P_912] company .
if master market maker enron goes down , this winter [P_93] a truly chilling [P_95] north americans.(enron corp. in danger of defaulting)(brief article )
those of us who thought the energy industry [P_92] escape [P_93] technology bear [P_94] have been too complacent .
since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron 's [P_96] to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies [P_911] enormous if enron were to default .
many u.s. energy producers locked in high prices by making huge [P_93] sales .
by reducing its earnings by more than $ 100 m for several years , enron has created concern about its [P_96] service debt .
according to a report filed with the sec , it [P_93] start a chain of full - service , white - tablecloth italian restaurants " based on authentic italian regional recipes .
a report on its web site suggests the stock is " [P_93] ground - floor [P_95] [ for the ] investor with vision .
it says the big board has made " [P_92] progress " in regulating brokers , but deficiencies remain : among other things , the nyse needs to [P_99] surveillance of floor members , ensuring that regulators are on the trading floor to [P_914] potential violations .
no doubt the nyse 's regulatory improvements are commendable -- just [P_93] does n't take another two years for the exchange to get its practices completely up to par .
the hewlett family , which still holds a 5 per cent stake in the computer company , announced [P_96] oppose management 's plan to merge with compaq .
maybe investors [P_90] that change .
but buying enron stock in the [P_92] the valuation will turn out to be above the present price [P_96] a slightly ambitious [P_98] even the most well informed investors .
and the ultimate purchase price [P_91] - repeat , should , not must - be above that book value .
if dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , [P_95] have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern .
also , this is probably a " once in a corporate lifetime " [P_94] a merger of such large companies with the likely quick approval of antitrust regulators .
there was no [P_91] the federal reserve or any other government entity would or [P_95] step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets .
so enron 's $ 13bn of debt is most [P_93] a [P_93] buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices .
if the companies combined , they would create a $ 21bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy - marketing [P_97] financial resources , " says christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group .
it has also [P_91] its wholesale operations well beyond a uk presence .
dynegy 's [P_90] platform , [P_92] - which helped raise the company 's recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a [P_910] with enron online .
dynegy is also an [P_91] trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron [P_95] bail out its [P_97] suitor in the past from [P_99] trading losses .
analysts say there [P_91] a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility [P_98] only [P_99] .
most analysts believe a deal [P_91] done , but [P_93] more than a year due to [P_96] and the complexity of the two companies .
[P_90] negative consequence to enron would affect both physical commodities prices for electricity and gas as well as have a negative affect on financial energy products .
enron 's demise would not only hurt the thousands with exposure to the group through its trading operations ; [P_96] also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector .
out of respect for enron 's presence , my sense is the industry has tried to give them [P_96] of the doubt [P_97] if they can resolve this situation , " says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie .
the group 's banks , due to meet today , [P_93] secure $ 3.3bn in unsecured [P_95] drawn down in the past month .
but they may not [P_91] to renegotiate the terms unless enron 's situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a default .
in a regulatory filing , enron said it had restated accounts from 1997 to the third quarter of this year , leading to an increase of $ 628 m in debt for the year 2000 , and [P_912] net income up to the third quarter of this year .
[P_90] cheap , but the stock has collapsed [P_93] reason .
a rescue by dynegy and chevrontexaco corp. , a major dynegy shareholder , [P_94] enron with $ 1.2 billion in cash , according to sources familiar with the negotiations .
another [P_90] outcome [P_91] a major investment in enron by dynegy and potentially other energy companies , if the right collateral [P_97] , sources said .
not everyone has been [P_91] do it .
however , the picture [P_91] even worse .
if so , the ljm2 deals were n't as arms length as [P_94] project right now .
the ljm2 number is certainly [P_91] , but in and of itself the equity number means little when you [P_96] sheer [P_97] of the deals ljm2 and enron did [P_910] .
through the raptor deals , ljm2 agreed [P_92] enron whole for losses sustained if the assets declined in value , and it [P_97] to profit if these assets went up in value .
however , to make hedges of this [P_92] , raptor would 've needed adequate cushion against potential losses .
rival dynegy inc. however , the action still left analysts [P_93] whether further negative disclosures [P_95] coming .
some analysts suggested the deal has problems [P_92] pose [P_93] risks for dynegy .
both trade on [P_91] stock exchange . .
analysts said enron ran into trouble with its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron [P_97] off its books .
they protected its credit rating , [P_92] it to obtain [P_93] interest rates on its corporate borrowings .
the small - cap market [P_91] to post slimmer declines than the [P_94] nasdaq market because of the strength of financial stocks , which make up the largest industry group in the russell 2000 following technology .
investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported [P_95] bigger profits and executives boasted they would successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications .
wall street analysts admitted they were stunned by [P_92] demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy [P_96] enron 's credibility .
but [P_90] always [P_91] much financial visibility [P_93] and steering clear of any company [P_96] not -- [P_97] not -- [P_99] .
the domestic lenders have tried to facilitate a meeting between prospective buyers and the seller as we have a common [P_96] saving this power project from going bust , " saxena said .
` ` tata and bses [P_91] to buy [P_93] but [P_94] on the terms enron sets , ' ' said v.k. saxena , chief general [P_99] industrial [P_910] bank of india , or idbi , the country 's second - biggest lender .
but until i see terms of the deal and [P_93] conditions , i 'd be cautious [P_95] any judgements .
on thursday , the wall street journal reported that dynegy and enron are in talks [P_95] lead to a merger in a stock swap worth $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion .
a merger , according to a number of sources , [P_93] prevent big troubles for many energy companies .
we see this [ the potential collapse of enron ] as a situation that [P_94] downsides for the entire industry .
in some ways , it [P_91] a natural [P_93] .
kevin boone , an analyst with bear stearns in [P_93] , said the top 20 energy companies in the u.s. [P_97] n't [P_97] encroach on enron 's former share in the marketplace if dynegy and enron merge .
chevrontexaco , which recently [P_91] its own merger , may contribute about $ 1.5 billion to push the deal with dynegy and enron [P_97] , according [P_98] reports , and analysts had varying opinions on chevrontexaco 's involvement in the talks .
others said chevrontexaco [P_91] enron 's pipeline assets and one analyst said the oil giant 's aa credit rating from wall street [P_98] the combined company grow .
investors were disappointed because they [P_91] dynegy would announce [P_93] buy its beleaguered rival .
dynegy will have to recalculate enron`s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated numbers , [P_96] not be the last of those restatements .
and [P_90] also mean any deal [P_92] dragged down .

since such transaction [P_91] to be priced based upon the credit rating of the entity or the sponsors ( [P_96] upon [P_97] ) the expected returns will not justify the balance sheet [P_911] northern border partners if this entity were to function as lessor .
at that point , [P_91] commercial banks or major leasing companies [P_94] a cost - effective financing transaction .

even with the 40 long - term deals announced by davis on monday , experts interviewed tuesday said , up to 43 percent of the state 's daily needs [P_99] to come from this highly volatile market , in which power is bought within a day [P_915] .
that [P_90] hugely expensive , because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what [P_96] under [P_97] - term contracts .
it 's widely expected that consumers ultimately [P_92] have to pay that [P_94] , [P_94] amount to billions of dollars .
if all that power has to [P_92] on the spot market , the price [P_95] high .
still falling short even if those hydropower imports [P_92] and conservation works as davis [P_95] , it 's likely california would still require the spot market for 11,000 megawatts to meet the august demand .

the conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively [P_94] sites for new power plants throughout the county .
the measure by supervisors mark desaulnier and federal glover , which passed on a 4-to-0 vote , directs the county administrator and department of community [P_98] to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days .
supervisor donna gerber abstained after criticizing the [P_92] potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state 's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state , region and county [P_911] years , and how much power is slated to come online .
the site [P_90] hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants , and a [P_94] 15-acre natural gas plant , said steve thomas , managing [P_98] golden state .
thomas said 30 acres [P_91] kept as open space to form a buffer around the project .
we believe that the site is [P_92] .

i do n't think that pittsburg or east county [P_93] the dumping ground for energy for california , " said beals .
contra costa county supervisors took tentative steps tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer , ordering that its staff identify [P_99] sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks .
gerber said the county should examine the [P_92] power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet .
fifth district supervisor federal glover backed desaulnier , but said he [P_93] a location outside his heavily industrialized east county district .
desaulnier said he believed a peaker plant [P_92] built about a month after [P_94] .
supervisors also heard from [P_91] developers of a 650-megawatt plant between bay point and concord .
the thomas site [P_91] house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online .
desaulnier seemed cautious about [P_91] proposal , which he had described last week as " a [P_95] site .

both versions added a concept of " [P_92] agreement " as a new [P_94] as an [P_96] - on to the definitions of [P_98] , swap agreement , repo agreement and securities contract ..
we were [P_90] see an amendment to this [P_93] broadened this language to include any type of payment that [P_97] due from the debtor under a [P_99] contract [P_910] are still unclear as to what a " settlement " payment means .
if [P_90] at section 362 ( b ) 17 which deals with swaps , this language is much broader and it was our [P_98] the setoff language [P_99] contracts [P_910] track the setoff language for swaps .
also , we were [P_91] that the setoff language [P_93] contarcts would apply to anyone taht was a party to a [P_97] and not just " [P_99] contract merchants " as currently drafted .
finally , we like the fact that the definition of " swap agreement " was expanded , but are concerned with [P_97] language and how it would apply to our newer products such as weather derivatives since in order [P_913] within [P_914] definition , it must be something that is currently or in [P_918] " regularly " entered into in [P_920] market .

while competition in the backbone network business is booming , [P_93] technologies coming into the market [P_95] it much [P_96] increase bandwidth [P_98] any fiber - optic network tenfold or more .
and that step may [P_91] difficult than building the networks themselves . '
the combination of major [P_91] network construction [P_92] technology [P_93] network capacity has led industry analysts and executives to [P_97] a bandwidth glut that is likely to drive down prices in backbone transport of data much as the price of long - distance telephony has plummeted in the past few years .
rather than a free fall in prices , however , [P_93] market to [P_94] find [P_95] ways to use bandwidth , both in terms of network - based [P_99] bigger backbone networks to support the rapidly growing [P_913] faster access via digital subscriber line ( dsl ) and cable modems .
[P_90] without any backhoes .
dwdm technology and optical amplifiers , which boost the power of a laser 's signal over a given wavelength , [P_96] bandwidth to [P_97] and allow signals to travel farther without the [P_911] for as many repeaters to boost signals along the way .
also coming into the market by [P_92] sonet gear that quadruples the current transmission rates from 10 gbps to 40 gbps .
we [P_90] it because we are building a green - field network that does n't have the cost of legacy technology like circuit switches .
greater bandwidth and lower prices also [P_92] new video services to be delivered over the internet , says vab goel , vice president of ip [P_98] technology at qwest .
we [P_90] network will drive cost down and increase [P_93] value - added applications which [P_95] delivered over an ip network .
[P_90] to enabling [P_91] , however , the sudden availability of bandwidth will dramatically change the way services are priced and sold .
it 's [P_90] challenge of the internet - deciding [P_93] are going to bill customers and what they will [P_97] to pay for , " analyst bernstein says .

i will say that i 've heard [P_92] about clark , but have n't worked with him .
i [P_90] talk [P_92] about this [P_93] .
[P_90] may know from john , we have been very involved with the tex mex transmission line [P_96] we have done with bpub and that has just received [P_910] .
we have a [P_91] relationship , i believe , with bpub , the port of brownsville and their respective counsel from that transaction .
john also seems to believe the deals with bpub and the port [P_94] structured along the same lines as the transmission project , and as the draftsmen for not only the docs with bpub , but also the port , we are also obviously very familiar [P_915] documents as well .
[P_90] possibly talk about [P_91] ?
[P_90] to do a deal [P_92] and [P_93] and given our background on the first project , [P_97] seem [P_98] a lot of sense from your point of view as well .
i would [P_90] to drop by [P_92] , timing , etc .
whenever it [P_90] you .
[P_90] - [P_91] from you .
the checklist was [P_91] as an aid [P_92] ensure books are officialized .
[P_90] making this checklist more comprehensive [P_93] .
[P_90] be [P_91] strategy and group direction !
if i [P_90] an estimated time frame of when [P_93] those back that [P_95] .
i really [P_90] your [P_91] on this matter .
i told him i [P_91] , and now michael thinks i [P_94] with him , then he [P_96] teach neil .
this is just a [P_91] , that i 'm not [P_93] 'll even [P_95] time .
[P_90] is just social and hopefully he [P_92] it that way .

indeed , unless you simply have n't been keeping up with [P_93] of how brokers are getting rich with big commissions , [P_97] a bizarre [P_99] out [P_910] community , [P_911] maintain a strong bias against annuities .
those payments [P_90] at some date in [P_92] or they may [P_94] on the day you buy the contract .
[P_90] in the annuity [P_91] a return , and those [P_94] grow untaxed until you receive annuity payments .
a fixed annuity thus provides a steady retirement income -- but this steady return [P_94] eroded by inflation .
when used , the payments under that feature [P_92] initially [P_93] lower than a fixed payment , but over the years the payments [P_97] steadily increase at the specified rate .
for those [P_90] live many years , the added cost of this feature [P_94] worth the price , but [P_97] pay dearly for this option .
while these subaccounts may invest [P_91] a mutual fund , subaccounts almost certainly will have a different and higher expense structure , and possibly a far different return than that of the public mutual fund .
still , over the long - term , a variable annuity invested in a stock subaccount should provide a [P_96] inflation - protected income than a fixed annuity .
a recent innovation in the insurance industry , an equity - index annuity is a form of a fixed annuity contract tied to a stock index that provides [P_99] returns better than those in a traditional fixed annuity , but less than those of a [P_916] in the market itself .
you are so awesome to [P_91] to [P_92] out in my [P_94] .

he 's got [P_91] speed for a tight end .
on keeping [P_90] emotions down and not overpursuing plays on defense [P_94] did last year in the first quarter against nebraska we 've had a lot of big games since then as well , and [P_912] in that game [P_914] them .
i think at that time we were coming off an off - week that also [P_95] may not have been a factor .
i think our players [P_91] more seasoned in this type of atmosphere today then they were at that [P_96] year .
yes , but i felt he was a [P_92] thrower last year .

we understand that , but i also [P_92] has a way of [P_94] has [P_95] as well .
this game has not only determined [P_92] , but you [P_94] both these schools with 12 national championships between them and so many times , whoever has the conference championship has a [P_911] the [P_913] .

on if he feels [P_91] about nebraska having played [P_93] big games this [P_94]
and after the game , win or lose , they say " [P_94] " , " [P_95] " and generally defy what you come [P_98] from having been to many of the other places we play .
when you finally enter the playing field it 's [P_93] what it must have been for those gladiators centuries ago .
