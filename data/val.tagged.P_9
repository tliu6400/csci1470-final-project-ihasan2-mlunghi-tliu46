i2 expressed considerable [P_91] below the executive level , but enw had [P_95] getting a concrete bid or proposal from i2 .
i2 's response to the enron [P_92] was that they considered it high and that they [P_95] with enron in some manner in [P_98] to some form of purchase .
since those early discussions with i2 , enw has discussed [P_93] with other selected [P_95] , and is now considering bids from several [P_98] counterparties .
generally speaking the deal structure that appears to [P_92] best [P_93] both parties entails involvement by enw after the transaction , in the form of equity participation or royalty payments or both , as well as the transfer of some enron people .
this seems [P_90] us into the realm of a " partnership " structure [P_94] fit the [P_96] i2 interest .
[P_90] to [P_91] we give i2 [P_92] to outline a [P_94] a price as well as outline [P_97] for a relationship [P_98] , or to [P_910] they are not [P_912] .

el paso says it 's open to expansion of system el paso natural gas " is willing [P_95] its system " to the california border if " sufficient support " for such a [P_911] demonstrated through long - [P_913] contracts , the pipeline told ferc .
the pipeline 's comments were in response to a commission inquiry asking el paso to consider [P_95] of upgrading its proposed line 2000 crude - oil conversion [P_99] a system [P_910] ease the pipeline capacity crunch in the west .
daniel m. adamson , director of ferc 's office of energy [P_93] , raised the prospect in a jan. 3 letter to el paso , saying that modifying the project " could [P_910] the difficult situation " now facing the california gas market .
el paso proposed the line 2000 [P_92] a [P_93] line to replace existing compression , and not as a system [P_97] .
however , " there are several [P_92] accomplished , " wrote el paso vice president al clark on jan. 15 .
el paso [P_90] to the proposed line 2000 project , or [P_94] replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon in place .
as a third option , he said el paso [P_93] to its existing system or [P_96] either the [P_97] system or line 2000 [P_98] .
the " preferable method will have to be determined by a [P_93] analysis of the relative costs and a determination of where shippers [P_97] the capacity , i.e. where they [P_910] put gas into el paso 's system and where they [P_914] gas delivered , " clark said .
as a " first step " towards gauging market support for [P_93] , he noted that el paso on jan. 12 posted 1.2 bcf / d of california - bound pipeline [P_910] sale effective june 1 of this year .
when the posting results are known , " el paso [P_93] whether another [P_94] is needed to solicit expressions of [P_97] in [P_98] pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of california .
if el paso finds there is an " unmet demand [P_93] capacity " on its system , the pipeline at that time " [P_98] whether [P_99] of the existing system or a modification of the line 2000 project , or both , is [P_915] means of accomplishing the expansion , " clark noted .
not only will the [P_91] " increase the operational flexibility " of el paso 's current system , but converting the line from oil to gas service will be a " necessary prerequisite " to any [P_912] of the pipeline 's system , according to clark .

i was [P_90] before now , but two lengthy trips abroad have precluded this .
i thought [P_90] to recap where we now are and what i have in mind .
you summarised the three topics where [P_92] you as 1 .
[P_90] aim to bring this to a wider audience , but there are lots of papers on this topic now , and the situation [P_98] almost daily , so [P_910] it into a paper on europe .

[P_90] , i like the letter .
although hydro output has kept pace with demand and reservoir water levels continue to rise , the increase is much slower than historical [P_97] season buildups .
brazil is expected to [P_91] 1,200 megawatt ( mw ) of new thermal capacity in 2000 , as well as a further 1,309 mw of nuclear capacity when the angra ii unit enters [P_911] .
[P_90] capacity [P_91] meet [P_92] increase in demand growth as brazil 's economy strengthens throughout the year [P_96] do little to mitigate power shortages if the current rainfall is insufficient to replenish brazil 's reservoirs .
this recovery was enough to bring year - to - date power demand into [P_94] growth [P_95] the first time , increasing 0.5 percent over j !
october and november brought the strongest growth to the paper , beverage , and transportation materials sectors , supported by [P_96] prices [P_97] markets and [P_98] of the summer .
in recent months , however , there has been a slow but steady growth in industrial output , led by a recovery [P_97] markets for export [P_99] an [P_910] in the economic situation .
this growth is expected to continue in [P_92] months as brazil 's economy continues to strengthen .
even this limited growth is due entirely to [P_92] of new billable customers , which [P_95] the customer base by 4.6 percent in the 12 months ending in november 1999 .
increasing electricity intensity of [P_91] has also played a role , [P_94] businesses have greater electricity needs than their predecessors .
in the interim , thermal generation will remain higher than historical averages [P_94] units , including cuiaba and angra ii , will [P_97] increase thermal power [P_99] the total generation mix .
this combination of demand growth and uncertain water supply will [P_93] increase the pressure [P_94] generation capacity .
many risks and uncertainties remain , however , limiting any [P_93] 's ability to reach financial closure .
the continued delay in moving [P_91] , [P_92] one to two years of construction once [P_96] are made viable , [P_98] tighten brazil 's supply - demand balance in [P_911] year , regardless of the availability of water .

, i went home last night and continued to study the examples of hedging you were [P_95] to walk us through and arrived at the following conclusions , which i [P_910] to correct me on and/or confirm my thought process . -
first , given the added uncertainty of procaribe 's volumes ( sales ) now that progasco is owned by someone else , unless miguel can guarantee ( [P_99] form of written agreement ) that he [P_912] progasco 's volumes , i [P_914] more open to or more inclined to borrow eco 's volumes ( clearly , [P_920] n't do so if [P_920] awful - then it becomes an issue of cash flow vs. product pricing optimization ) .
third , it seems to me that , on the [P_93] hedge , ( the second part of the volume ) someone lost [P_97] - i [P_99] wrong , but what i 'm [P_911] is the fix [P_913] ( suzanne got )

as for whether an [P_91] required , i assume [P_94] not [P_95] caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral .

a way for enron alumni to stay [P_92] .
given the current events of the last several years regarding power generation and delivery across our nation , i have a proposal , i 'm [P_98] interest you .
it appears that there are vast [P_92] available to an aggressive , first mover organization which [P_95] together [P_96] , and bring all the players [P_99] along with the capital markets to initiate , [P_912] additional capacity or to enhance the existing power delivery and transfer .
[P_90] transmission capacity must [P_91] built , including [P_92] interconnects between the various grids and/or existed interconnects strengthened .
[P_90] to transfer power from the east coast to the west coast , as the power demand peak moves across the country from [P_98] , or the [P_99] to transfer power from such area 's as nova scotia which has an abundant supply of inexpensive hydro power [P_916] situation .
what i propose , is [P_91] of a [P_93] enron company , of which its vision [P_95] to identify and [P_97] opportunities to build various transmission assets , and/or [P_910] generation capacity or to strengthen existing assets .
[P_90] be accomplished by bringing various players [P_92] under the enron lead , [P_94] with the capital markets [P_96] a strategy , allowing for the [P_99] .
this capacity [P_90] then be traded or used for power transfers from regions with inexpensive supplies to [P_95] shortages exist .

[P_90] has already been presented to the national energy committee [P_93] by president bush as a viable [P_96] potential solution .
this is just the beginning , and given the historical lack of investment in the grid , many more opportunities will had by an aggressive [P_98] the foresight to put [P_910] capture them as they come [P_913] .

a free [P_90] a [P_91] season [P_92]
since the beginning of winter the pacific northwest has received normal precipitation , with greater snowpacks in the northern part of [P_97] than in the southern part .
given current conditions , it [P_91] that california will end winter at below - average hydroelectric conditions .
because of [P_90] concentration of facilities , above - average precipitation in the pacific northwest [P_95] to offset [P_96] - average precipitation in california and other parts of the west , although transfer capabilities limit the amount of energy exported from those regions .
normal hydroelectric generation this year [P_91] bring a 250 mmcf per day increase in western gas demand for power generation during the first quarter .
this modest demand increase [P_91] support prices in the western markets , with regional weather differences contributing to western strength as well .
however , with normal weather in the west , that general weakening in western prices [P_95] take place toward the end of february and into march .
it seems that [P_91] do [P_92] to assign the agreements .

note : this interview with jack crawford of alliance is probably the best [P_94] have gained on the pipeline operational [P_97] and background information .
the last [P_90] did this the forecasts we got suggested that we 'd be running at about 1.325 bcf on the first day .
one of the key questions remaining is whether alliance 's main downstream supply outlet , the 270-mile [P_95] , [P_97] go as well on dec. 1 .
the pipeline would transport 700 mmcf / d of gas initially from joliet , il , through indiana and michigan to dawn , on , [P_98] to 1 bcf / d next november .
it 's been a challenge for them to get going , but [P_94] like they are all [P_96] go .
a [P_90] spokesman confirmed that commissioning is going smoothly and operations appear to [P_94] schedule for dec. 1 start - up .
[P_90] again [P_92] and [P_93] , but right now [P_96] 're getting things pretty well wrapped up .
the last place [P_91] 've been [P_92] been up in the milford and highland townships in oakland county , mi .
once the massive [P_91] is running smoothly , [P_93] steps to be taken include potential connections with several proposed pipelines in and around chicago , including [P_99] guardian , horizon and whitecap energy [P_912] .
we 've obviously talked about a [P_92] expansion in [P_93] , but as we found out by talking to people [P_97] like the supply additions in the western canadian sedimentary basin have not been as brisk [P_912] might have thought , probably because of the downturn in the oil price a couple of years ago .
it 's likely that [P_91] delayed for a year or two or even three .
[P_90] that i 've [P_91] to ascertain from talking to people is that our supply deliverability really has not increased [P_97] in the last two to three years , and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our system will end up coming out of other systems .

dear mr. jeffrey skilling , it is [P_92] pleasure and a grand sense of history that we write to [P_96] that [P_97] been nominated for the 2001 world technology award for commerce .
this year not only will be having the second awards ceremony on the evening of this coming july 2nd at the national museum of science & industry here in central london , [P_910] the first world technology summit next door on the campus of imperial college of science , technology & industry on july [P_919] 2nd .
< < < < < [P_91] enormously to [P_93] the world technology summit .
wtn is a global association of some of the most [P_93] innovative people in the technology world , focused [P_96] a wide [P_98] ( [P_99] .
tech . , biotech / medical , new materials , energy , communications , and space - related technologies , etc . ) happen [P_98] and better than they might have otherwise .
we are identifying the people who [P_92] play a key role in the technological drama over [P_95] years and decades and bringing them [P_98] create relationships [P_99] accelerate the application of these technologies .
we are trying to increase the chances of the ' [P_93] accidents ' which [P_94] occur when cutting - edge [P_96] , entrepreneurial people , and institutions with vision collide to create innovation .
the world technology summit is an historic two - day gathering ( july 1/2 , 2001 ) of several hundred of the world 's key technology players - scientists , technologists , entrepreneurs , industrialists , financiers , journalists , and policy - makers - [P_915] and catalyse the emerging [P_917] will have the greatest impact upon industry and society in [P_920] century and to create the relationships [P_920] those [P_920] the companies behind them to succeed .
the summit [P_90] network members , fellows and other specially invited delegates to think deeply about [P_95] - how they [P_97] today 's industries and those industries yet to be born .
the last evening of the summit [P_92] capped by a gala ceremony during which [P_95] present the second annual world technology awards , recognising those involved in technology who are taking the actions and making the decisions with the greatest [P_914] long - term [P_915] on business and society .
the [P_90] wing is the largest museum facility in the world devoted [P_94] it 's a wonderfully appropriate site to recognise history in the making .
an interactive exhibit is also being developed which will [P_93] thousands of museum visitors to vote and comment on finalists for the world technology awards during the week leading up to [P_910] on the evening of july 2nd .
keynote speakers [P_90] a visionary [P_92] the interacting roles of technology and business .
session speakers [P_90] their own particular specialty .
the world technology summit is a gathering where all participants are [P_93] with a crucial role to play in the unfolding drama of technology .
sessions [P_90] on a [P_91] of goals -- providing a [P_93] grounding in all six of the major emerging tech .
areas ; on [P_91] opportunities for participants ; and , on developing [P_94] , new corporate initiatives , [P_97] partnerships , and even new industries .
each roundtable [P_90] include an assortment of top - level [P_93] given a topic / field in which [P_97] .
p&l. i will describe the complete process in [P_92] in the [P_94] days .
i [P_90] revise sa reporting , specifically : - break out an origination line - [P_95] copel mtm below the line - [P_97] process of calculating p&l and var by trader ees
i [P_90] the latest one to you shortly and [P_93] you to comment / critique it .
i plan to [P_91] at least partial days [P_92] until the baby arrives , monitoring e - mail [P_96] on a few ongoing [P_98] , [P_99] reachable at [P_910] .
if a candidate [P_91] ca n't win in ca , then a total gop abandonment of the state should be imposed for the [P_98] millennium .
nonetheless , in certain cases i thought it made sense to [P_93] contract language on some of the points [P_97] so that [P_98] clearly see what [P_910] be proposing on a particular item .
i know that you expressed some reservations the other evening that this process potentially [P_94] subject to some manipulation .
the draft provides [P_91] , although enron is open to other [P_94] locations .
--we [P_90] to [P_91] effect of an adverse federal regulatory change .
i 'm [P_90] can [P_91] this in light of the current environment , although [P_95] freely negotiated bilateral contracts would not be subject to the types [P_910] being discussed .
enron is not seeking a termination right with lds , [P_93] discuss a termination right without compensation in [P_97] of a major adverse federal development affecting the contract .
however , [P_90] it is appropriate that if that circumstance occurs , that the [P_95] for payments by cdwr should [P_97] to 7 days and if the bonds are subsequently upgraded that the payment schedule would revert accordingly .
[P_90] discussed , [P_91] very [P_92] the case that at the time any assignment were to [P_96] effected that enron [P_97] already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those counter parties .
--in light of [P_91] about opinions not being provided by outside counsel , we modified the [P_95] request that the opinions [P_97] from the ag , or if cdwr can not do that , then from the gc of cdwr .
[P_90] that [P_91] not involve [P_92] work since these presumably will [P_94] rendered in connection with the bonds and [P_97] that they generally [P_98] provided to us after the bonds are issued .
also , [P_90] sense for [P_92] call to have [P_94] enron and cdwr commercial [P_96] the call since it [P_98] the case that many of [P_910] decisions involved [P_911] commercial ones .
thus , it [P_91] that [P_92] modifications or [P_94] the documents .
[P_90] finalize the requisite documents .
as iso indicated [P_91] this is a key regulatory concern of theirs , and i do not [P_96] until i understand enron 's position .
[P_90] tana , i [P_91] to make the death by chocolate if no one has taken it yet .
[P_90] directions , [P_92] have no problems .
we had to make [P_91] .
i would not want [P_91] either unless you are a " sponsor " and believe such tools would clearly add value immediately .
- i [P_90] both a brief [P_93] of the reviews this past week of elaw and evelocity .
, the user are the most [P_92] seeing .
the loading process is fairly easy [P_92] implemented within a firm environment .
some of [P_90] that [P_91] the most [P_93] is due to be released in a [P_95] coming out early q1 and by the end of 2001 there is the plan to have at least 10 or so practice areas available .
i think the tool [P_91] , especially in relation to the organization of [P_95] obtain from our outside sources .
it [P_90] complement the website / portal concept we are currently [P_94] make a part of the website / [P_97] development process .
i [P_90] see , however , what other tools are out there doing the same or similar function .
[P_90] require interfacing with ap and the sap system , but [P_94] be done .
[P_90] in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a budget or overall costs [P_96] matters .
in keeping with [P_91] surrounding the technology plan [P_93] ews , as well as similar [P_95] the corp. [P_97] / website , it makes sense to [P_910] implementing a matter management system of some sort that goes beyond litigation tracking .
whether or not it is evelocity or another comparable [P_93] would require [P_94] research into the [P_95] products , but i believe it [P_97] while to pursue [P_99] a [P_910] atmosphere .
if either of [P_91] like [P_92] or [P_93] questions , [P_94] .
[P_90] , pat and i were thinking [P_92] to have a wedding shower bbq for alice and jeff .
currently , enrononline can only [P_91] one [P_92] & end date per deal therefore [P_94] fail in the bridge monitor [P_97] have to be manually entered [P_99] & subsequently cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions [P_91] flow [P_91] , it is imperative that these transactions get [P_95] .
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions [P_93] to [P_94] to react quickly when they do .

( we [P_90] a one day reservation for all the speakers just in case , but are not sure which day [P_98] or if [P_99] tostay longer --so we ned to [P_912] precise plans to avoid booking confusion ) .
i expect the bobcats to bounce [P_92] a strong effort here at home , where they are 14 - 7 ats the last 5 years and 8 - 1 straight up recently .
i 'll [P_90] another [P_91] upset here as the irish continue to be overrated .
notre dame has [P_91] defensive front and they should have their way with an inexperienced michigan state offensive line with 4 [P_97] starters .
the spartans , meanwhile , qualify in a 95 - 38 - 3 ats road underdog situation that won for me in a best [P_98] on utah at oregon two weeks ago , and they also qualify in a 48 - 16 ats early season road underdog situation that is 17 - 2 ats the last 5 years .
with those angles qualifying , i 'll call for an even [P_93] margin than my ratings [P_95] the spartans a best bet .
the demon deacons ' veterans [P_91] into grobe 's demanding work ethic and the results are a 2 - 0 [P_97] that includes an impressive road win at east carolina ( a probable bowl team ) in which the deacons out - gained the pirates 451 yards to 294 yards .
wake forest has more talent than is indicated by last year 's 2 - 9 record and [P_95] like jim grobe has started to get this team to play to their potential .
wake forest , meanwhile , qualifies in a 46 - 14 - 2 ats early season home underdog situation that has been [P_97] to me over the years .
while both of these [P_91] vastly [P_92] with their new coaches , it [P_94] if wake forest is more [P_97] and a bit underrated .
with that being the case and [P_92] situations supporting the demon deacons as well , i [P_95] for the upset .
while i respect north carolina 's defense and usually [P_93] take big home underdogs with a strong stop unit , i will side with the seminoles in this game on the basis of a 126 - 58- 1 ats statistical indicator .
it [P_90] if those pointspread results have given us line value on the side of the bulls in this game and [P_97] that [P_98] out [P_98] 0 - 2
buffalo is just 4 - 8 ats on the road since they became a division 1a team 3 years ago , so i will hold off [P_98] a play on them here despite [P_911] value and [P_912] situation .
fresno state has [P_91] 3 straight upset wins and [P_94] think that this [P_95] a letdown spot for them .
however , teams that [P_91] season 3 - 0 straight up are actually [P_94] plays as road favorites in game 4 and fresno is as good as they 've shown in beating [P_911] bowl teams colorado , oregon state and wisconsin .
tulsa should have some [P_91] in the air with talented 3rd year starter josh blankenship throwing to a [P_96] corps of receivers .
things [P_90] pretty competitive in this game as tulsa was 5 - 1 ats at home last year while fresno is just 2 - 9 ats as a road favorite since ' 94 , including 0 - 4 ats the last 2 years .
[P_90] another big win for the buffaloes .
smu returns 18 starters from last year 's 3 - 9 team and i expected them to be [P_96] on both sides of the ball .
nc state opened the season with an [P_92] 35 - 14 win over indiana and their offense [P_95] a bit better than it was a year ago .
smu does qualify in a couple of strong early season [P_93] , a 31 - 8 ats underdog bounce - back situation and a 46 - 14 - 2 ats home underdog angle , so i [P_912] a couple of points to their total .
and they [P_90] 's big game with rival north carolina .
was asking if it is appropriate to use a set [P_93] corresponding to some commodity [P_95] commodity .
i think using this kind of mappings is ok because we [P_93] not trust these correlations based on illiquid price information .
[P_90] believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 [P_98] - then [P_99] use more [P_910]
so [P_90] believe that [P_91] prices for this commodity are market prices and statistical [P_95] these prices produces the correlations which we trust , then [P_99] proper to use this [P_911] in var engine , not the [P_914] .
using factors is simply the way [P_92] up calculations for highly correlated prices without sacrificing the accuracy .
i agree that [P_91] this calculation engine for all commodity vars .
term structure of correlation [P_91]
i [P_90] factor loadings should [P_91] , on the same data sets used for inter commodity correlation , for all commodities .
to ensure this [P_91] i [P_92] a list of the mile stones , responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up
we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the best [P_93] at this time .
hence ( 1 ) [P_91] be using risktrac [P_93] var , as it is the " most accurate " , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most recent updated data .
however , [P_90] know , there [P_92] disconnects with enpower , etc .
in [P_90] , [P_91] be [P_92] and optimal to have all the simulations run out of risktrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis .

the customers had numerous questions for dti about why its [P_93] tcra filing [P_94] result in such a large rate increase , and advised dti that it needed to [P_99] information to the customers before they [P_912] a meaningful response to dti 's settlement proposal made on september 15 , 2000 .
the customers said they were [P_91] settlement ( in an effort to reduce the [P_95] of [P_96] tcra filing ) , but they [P_99] more of an explanation from dti of its proposed substantial rate increase .
dti said it had a $ 0.31 per mmbtu basis in this gas and that it was [P_95] save it for a [P_97] storage project .
at the conclusion of the meeting , the customers said they [P_93] ask more questions [P_95] present dti with their questions in [P_98] .

judge smith gave a brief overview of the parties ' opposing positions on the scope of permissible jurisdiction discovery - the defendants limiting that [P_98] to " contacts " and the plaintiffs treating it as tantamount to merits discovery .
i left the courtroom unsure how smith [P_92] decide which questions he thinks are within and without the limited personal jurisdiction discovery the cmo allows .
the court finally realized that the defendants were concerned he [P_93] ruling to compel discovery without having considered the various objections , and so made clear he is only going to now [P_911] sharp 's questions , give some [P_913] which questions seem within the scope of the order , and the defendants [P_918] objections [P_919] .

" in a competitive market , the market itself is expected to provide the signals that new construction is [P_96] .

i [P_90] in the [P_91] the afternoon of september [P_93] aside some time on my calendar if you [P_98] .
[P_90] need [P_91] the theoretical underpinnings , [P_93] .
similarly , enron japan does currently have weather exposure [P_93] and , [P_94] , can not be said to be hedging weather risk .
we understand that [P_91] 's business purposes allow enron japan to engage in weather derivative transaction .
[P_90] note that the financial law board ( paper [P_93] transactions and gambling , issued on november 29 , 1999 ; the financial law board is an unofficial organisation of legal practitioners ) has stated that a company that enters into derivative [P_914] a business [P_916] argue that it has a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transactions - particularly where the parties to the transaction are sophisticated and the transactions are conducted within reasonable parameters .
based [P_90] , [P_91] that [P_92] should [P_93] to give both representations .
we understand that the fsa has provided informal [P_92] to certain financial institutions to the effect that the provisions allowing financial institutions to enter into financial derivatives are wide enough to also allow financial institutions to enter into weather derivatives .
however , this is a matter that toare [P_92] with the fsa directly , [P_95] are not [P_97] express a general view - all that [P_910] is for [P_911] the representation from toa re .
[P_90] , assuming that toare [P_91] to give the representations referred [P_94] , and that these representations [P_96] , both paragraph ( a ) [P_99] ( b ) appear to apply .
thus , we do not believe that the risk for [P_93] in entering into this transactions with toare [P_96] any higher than would have been the case if [P_910] had entered into the transaction with a legitimate end user ( for example an air conditioning company ) .
it is conceivable that [P_91] , in [P_93] , enter into transactions with entities that are neither financial institutions nor end users ( for example , other traders [P_910] enron itself would fall into this category ) .
in our view , the risk for [P_92] in this scenario would increase , [P_95] characterised as being " relatively low " .
in this situation , [P_91] and the counterparty [P_93] give mutual representations to the effect of the representation set out in paragraph ( a ) under question 1 above .
the representations previously proposed were proposed on the basis that the [P_93] be an end user .
if appropriate , [P_91] to provide alternate forms of representations [P_94] reference .
dear jeremy , pls see for [P_92] my [P_93] alan , mark and alan .
i think the answer to question 1 - whether [P_93] give the warranty - has got to be no .
dear alan and mark , i [P_92] you [P_93] me [P_94] a risk decision .
i [P_90] but he [P_92] leaving this up to alan and mark because alan and mark have been involved in this gambling issue from the beginning .
- given that our legal situation is grey at best , i do not [P_94] should [P_95] the warranty they have requested .
dear jeremy , i [P_91] to refine the following instructions .
have we already had any written advice from [P_92] whether [P_93] can warrant [P_95] lines ?
they are insisting they not give ( ii ) and that [P_93] satisfied with ( iii ) only for the purposes of the gambling law pls confirm in writing [P_910] can still [P_912] on this basis .

however < if there exenuating circumstances [P_92] we [P_93] to win this at all costs , there are values not being calculated that the client would recognize , there are senior execs at ge plastics behind this [P_913] a way to close this , or [P_916] that is convincing your origination team that they have a winner here ....

given that we [P_91] minton 's , underwriters ' representatives , i would assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a total quantum before the joint survey takes place ; in fact , [P_913] the final determination of ect 's total quantum of damages [P_917] impacted by [P_919] of the joint survey ( although i would not necessarily [P_920] say that to underwriters at this point ) .

- thailnd shoretank samples brought to caleb brett singapore tested on spec , but note different [P_95] method used ( d5184/5185 ) .
certainly sufficient [P_90] the best [P_92] of establishing the cause .
to that end , i [P_91] that [P_92] the other parties with the test methods ( astm d - numbers ) and state that these tests [P_99] applied to retain samples from each of : 1 .
that [P_90] the investigation some testing [P_92] involve composites , some individual samples .
[P_90] to a degree [P_91] the lab 's [P_93] get any particulates into homogeneous suspension and keep them there long enough to make a composite .
insofar as identifying the particulates , [P_92] this prove necessary , i [P_94] keep [P_95] open .
while it is always [P_91] to perform unilateral analysis should disagreements arise , [P_94] to keep the parties together [P_96] .
but [P_90] limit at the beginning the [P_92] extent of testing [P_94] be necessary , it [P_96] prove meaningless .

[P_90] legislation 's primary focus is the separation of the retail marketing activities -- [P_95] be completely competitive -- from the electric utility 's regulated transmission and distribution activities .
the proposal [P_90] by the distribution cooperatives would [P_92] them to create a [P_94] to market electric power to retail customers throughout arkansas .
if a distribution cooperative decides to withdraw from the [P_93] , [P_94] compete with the joint [P_96] and all consumers .
each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric power generating capacity in arkansas , and the combined generating power capacity of the 17 distribution cooperatives is approximately 6 percent of the total generating capacity in the two areas of arkansas in which the joint [P_915] is [P_916] to market .
the joint venture is expected to [P_92] economies of scale that would give it [P_94] distribution costs in statewide or regional markets than would be attainable by individual members .
he commented that " while the distribution cooperatives [P_92] viewed as [P_94] entrants into each other 's local retail markets , [P_97] and a state - wide market , their small [P_911] and relatively high operating costs [P_913] unlikely that they [P_914] on their own or that , if they tried to enter , they would offer effective competition .

the state energy commission predicts that current programs [P_92] boost that to 17 percent by 2006 .
the more [P_90] factor may be the davis - burton feud which manifests itself in many ways , but particularly on the two most important pieces of late - session business , the davis - sponsored edison bailout and a multibillion - dollar boost in benefits for workers with job - related illnesses and injuries , carried personally by burton .

but ups vendors remain bullish [P_91] - term opportunities [P_93] arise from power - [P_95] .

' ' energy department spokesman joe davis said abraham is [P_93] proposal [P_94] n't comment on whether he would endorse it .

it presumes that generation owners [P_91] on violating the pre - [P_94] screens and counting on the revenue from those " golden eggs .
generators are not limited [P_91] revenue from the spot market and [P_94] well choose to sell energy in the bilateral market .
one generation owner did a [P_91] " good " job selling a [P_94] energy contract for the 6 month procurement period while the other owner did a relatively " poor " job selling a similar contract .
in [P_90] auctions they both should have the same strategy - [P_94] revenue that each of them [P_96] out of [P_97] auction .
this is not a significant change to the existing rules [P_93] seem unlikely [P_94] a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the underlying value of [P_910] product . " ... [P_912] uncertainty to [P_913] york market ...
i am not passing judgment at this stage , [P_93] that all [P_94] know that the prices that were posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent [P_910] required to some or all of the months .
whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the amp , i believe that it is most appropriate for the mmu to take immediate action and refer it to the committees for [P_913] resolution .
since last summer there have been very [P_92] > [P_93] the [P_94] affect [P_95] markets [P_96] york .
the basic theory on developing a bid into [P_92] market for an internal > generator is that the generator should [P_97] total revenue it > requires from [P_99] market to continue operating .
for > external suppliers [P_91] bid is based upon [P_93] cost of being > obligated to [P_96] york energy market rather than being either obligated > to another market or having no obligations to any market .
clearly , in each case , the bid into the capacity market is [P_94] > the expectations of the [P_96] energy market .
there have been several > adopted [P_92] energy markets that [P_95] them > both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy > markets surrounding new [P_911] .
the circuit breaker / amp - the circuit breaker / amp creates both a concern > that the day - ahead market prices [P_97] depressed from the levels that > should exist .
the implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns > that the market prices [P_94] york energy price [P_96] be depressed .
the > potential ways in which the dam [P_92] be depressed include failure to > [P_95] changing unit operating parameters , fuel costs , or emissions > costs .
[P_90] to these [P_91] about whether the amp will improperly depress > prices , there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been > improperly mitigated is supposed to [P_910] to be compensated .
bidding mechanism that is > being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated [P_94] to a small > subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at > the dam market prices .
this provides the [P_91] day - ahead market > prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if > this mechanism is abused .
each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy > market revenues and added significant uncertainty to [P_97] market .

i have made some drafting [P_91] in this regard the most [P_93] of which is the carve out of the language in the eta which provides that gtc 's will only apply if an isda has been executed .
incidentally - with respect to the eta - it seems [P_93] that [P_94] gtc 's [P_95] in respect of a transaction if an isda is not in place on the trade date of such transaction , however it does not seem [P_914] any provision for circumstances where an isda / master agreement is entered into subsequent to [P_920] of a transaction .

- federal reserve bank of [P_91] president william mcdonough said on thursday the international financial system is showing some signs of strain from a slowdown in global growth .
[P_90] york fed chief did not comment further on the global economy or [P_94] u.s. economy in the speech , which focused on global financial stability .
he advocated a [P_91] case - by - case approach to crisis management , adding that regulators should [P_96] for minimalist intervention .
speaking may 3 in frankfurt , germany , mcdonough said bank supervisors around the world should [P_95] banks to [P_97] their businesses and their risks .
notwithstanding considerable efforts at the public and private level to search for a [P_94] way , no magic bullet formula has been found .
if history is any guide , " he said , " [P_93] in markets and practices quickly will render obsolete those measures that might seem well attuned to today 's circumstances .
mcdonough said that approach , in his opinion , [P_93] investors skittish and [P_94] harder to generate support for honoring contractual commitments .
[P_90] up , i believe the one [P_92] fits all disposition inherent in the standstills approach risks making situations much worse than they [P_98] be , " he said .
just as bailouts [P_91] encourage too much risk taking , efforts to orchestrate preemptive bail - ins may encourage too little .

the way [P_90] dan , in response to your question yesterday , it should still [P_95] to get a structural ruling from the irs along the lines that deutschebank ( db ) had contemplated .
i doubt it , but if not , [P_92] to know so that [P_94] about other ways to do a coal deal with pacificorp .
we just [P_90] think in terms of what the landscape [P_93] in the absence of getting a new ruling .
one [P_90] with our [P_93] pacificorp 's facilties , meaning [P_95] relocate them , and continue running run - of - mine coal , the irs be damned , and just find an equity player with a greater risk profile than pacificorp .
in short , [P_91] need companies who are willing to rely on pacificorp 's existing rulings , period ( along with an appropriate indemnity ) .
in addition , the irs announcement does not require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output , as some commontators had feared , which is a [P_99] development because the pelletizing process [P_911] a tremendous drag on capacity .
however , there are real [P_91] .
it seems to me that if they [P_92] persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of [P_96] landscape , since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk , then [P_912] still have [P_913] to do a synfuel deal .

the commission has classified the investigation as a ratesetting proceeding and ordered the three?utilities to file a cost / [P_96] transmission upgrades as well as their own [P_910] peaking generation [P_912] summer .
the cpuc has authority over utilities , but cal - iso is the agency that is approving transmission upgrades to [P_96] by utilities and complementary [P_98] to be [P_910] market forces to hook into that transmission .
although the cpuc has not stepped fully into [P_92] generation siting process -- so far , a procedure that has been up to cal - iso and the california energy commission -- it does use the transmission inquisition as a foundation to question both transmission and generation projects .

the agreement includes endesa 's right to increase its [P_93] snet in the [P_94] in order to strengthen the cooperation between [P_97] and allow endesa to carry out its industrial [P_911] plan in france and europe .
[P_90] for endesa to acquire 30-percent [P_92] snet cements the company 's [P_94] into france , which is a major component in the aggressive [P_98] efforts endesa has been implementing this year .
endesa [P_90] to beat out other bidders for snet , including france 's suez lyonnaise des eaux and germany 's rwe , due to the positive valuation of endesa 's industrial and commercial [P_911] the economic value of its offer .
ironically , [P_90] benefit repsol as the company plans to invest in any companies that are divested due to the merger .
however , even though endesa may face expansion limitations in france , it [P_94] to remember how large the company is in its home country .

[P_90] feel quite proud of this achievment- [P_92] !
the deliverables here were to ( 1 ) obtain a tariff methodology [P_94] supreme decree that [P_95] the company finance - [P_97]
tariffs approved gentlemen , i am [P_92] to report that sirese approved substantial increases in tr 's tariffs consistent with the law and regulation .
[P_90] - we 'll get this back when we do a tariff revision [P_94] rates are used .
[P_90] exactly what has been removed , but my thought is that if that means we are unable [P_97] some services ( e.g. lpg transportation ) or the continued operation of some liquids laterals , [P_913] write to those producers affected suggesting that if they [P_916] these services to be continued they [P_919] to appeal the decision .
again since this is capex [P_91] get it back in the end on tariff [P_95] as long as the expenditure is [P_97] an annual basis in the sirese budget process .
we need to do a detailed study [P_92] an occ strategy .
we intend to fight this one very hard using all the external / independant [P_94] get .
as you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the [P_95] substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and [P_99] be subjected to some form of arbitary cut .
having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much [P_94] from [P_96] strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts [P_910] and hence managable increases .

[P_90] , [P_91] meeting regarding the brokerage agreements [P_93] this week on thursday at 3:30 p.m. [P_97] meet in cassandra 's [P_99] 2888 .
in [P_90] maintaining [P_91] its annual dividend of $ 1.34 per share , franklin disclosed that , [P_96] , southern [P_97] implement a [P_99] strategy , which focuses geographically on serving 10 states in the so - called " super southeast .
two recent and significant events at southern company set [P_93] for this pronouncement of a " new " strategy for the energy company based in atlanta .
yet now , even as national energy competitors grow [P_93] and [P_93] , southern company 's strong local presence and vertical [P_97] approach [P_97] ultimately prove to be the smartest strategy of all .
the [P_90] on unregulated power generation , through which southern reportedly plans [P_94] another 6,000 mw by 2003 , most likely refers to subsidiary operations such as southern nuclear and southern company energy solutions .
this has been a lucrative business [P_92] for the company for [P_93] .
the difference now - in [P_91] expanding from four to 10 states in the same region - is that southern [P_97] very [P_97] on the right track and [P_910] to have the last laugh as the deregulation game continues to unfold .
of course , ferc 's policy is that transmission - owning [P_93] " voluntarily " participate in an rto , but at the same time the commission would have control over southern 's market power in the region should the energy company ever want to merge with or acquire another utility .
[P_90] markets such as florida and california [P_93] southern 's base , while at the same time the company has held on to its market share in its own region .
for all of these [P_91] , southern [P_92] have one of the smartest strategies across the electric utility market .
focusing exclusively on the " super region " of the southeast appears to be providing a remarkable rate - of - [P_97] southern .
while other companies have rushed to merge , grow bigger [P_93] across the country , southern has taken a more methodical approach , which [P_98] get it across the " [P_910] line " before many other competitors .

williams probably will wind up [P_91] and smith probably will wind up at texas , but both cases will bear watching right up to and through signing day in february .
the horns have a [P_91] everyone in the top seven on that list - no . 1
that would give the longhorns four straight super classes heading [P_93] , for the first time , the oldest group of that foursome would be seniors or juniors who have redshirted .
pickryl also plans to graduate early , so he [P_93] be counted back to last year if he signs with texas .
the number will [P_91] the low side if smith stays solid and pickryl goes alsewhere , but it will rise if smith strays and pickryl comes aboard .

they also did a [P_91] job in the punt return game .
what that mean is that texas has a [P_92] land one of the four major bcs bowl spots if they take care of business and win their [P_910] games [P_911] the regular season at 10 - 1 .
the top two [P_91] the final bcs standings [P_93] play for the national title in [P_95] bowl on january 3 .
texas coach mack brown and his longhorns [P_92] that game , but their [P_95] somewhere between very slim and none because oklahoma would have to lose twice in the regular [P_911] that to happen and then the horns would have to beat the big 12 north winner , probably nebraska .
but , by winning out and finishing 10 - 1 , the longhorns would have a great [P_95] play in the sugar bowl [P_98] orleans in the post - season .

i believe that [P_91] instead run a single caida [P_93] group on ' network metrics , ' rather than the two proposed earlier .
it focuses on producing educational material about network measurement , and on [P_94] new metrics - these were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the caida members .
work through revised charter in [P_91] - identify [P_92] required for each part - determine who 's willing [P_96] on it
- summary of metrics used [P_91] services - gather information / [P_94] / emerging services , especially diffserv - based ones - make list of new metrics , either [P_910] measurement of existing services or to support [P_913] [ list of ' metrics ' questions ( appendix a ) goes here ]
+ organise experimental implementation / testing of tools [P_92] metrics + make recommendations on [P_95] - define core set of ' really [P_97] ' metrics - [P_99] caida implement these as a ' service measurement toolkit ' + publish new metric definitions through ippm or rtfm + produce document " measurement requirements for hardware / software vendors .
will [P_90] differentiated transport- and application - layer services need new metrics ?
its primary goal was to produce [P_92] traffic flow measurement [P_93] considering at least the following [P_95] :
these metrics [P_90] be designed such that they [P_92] network operators , end users , or independent [P_96] groups .
in short - rtfm provides a [P_92] distributed measuring system for traffic volumes - ippm has concentrated on transport - layer behaviour of the current , best - effort internet .

this [P_90] much easier than the rainbow option approach [P_93] allow us to roughly [P_95] the value of [P_97] on the other two ships .
in other words [P_91] two ship long [P_93] some implied volatilities and also [P_95] daily vars on the ships as if they were mark to market ( although i agree [P_911] that [P_912] not [P_913] mark the ships because they [P_916] treated as leases ) .
i would [P_90] spend the time to analyse [P_93] do power and gas positions .
here is [P_90] the decision : 1 ) our shipping expert confirms that $ 140 million for a 135,000 [P_97] ship represents a [P_98] price relative [P_99] build costs over the last three years and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently .
his [P_90] historic analysis [P_91] that the pricing cycle for lng ships lasts for a [P_95] period .
[P_90] efficiency measures should reduce new build prices ( and allow for a lower trough ) , but not by an extreme amount versus the $ 140 million cost of this vessel .
he estimates the ship [P_91] sold in a distressed sale for $ 110 million [P_95] be potentially time chartered on a long [P_98] at a value of up to $ 200 million .
the plant 's [P_91] and the realities of the lng supply market may require that we commit to gas natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured .
[P_90] , however , [P_91] plant [P_92] spain , and elsewhere in the med region , [P_96] the capacity to utilise these vessels .
[P_90] , some reason i [P_91] i was waiting [P_93] .
[P_90] the meter statements from gepl for february so that i [P_94] to [P_95] meters are flowing over what is nominated and [P_99] we have deals in the system for each offsystem meter .
[P_90] require a more specific listing , i have tom 's schematic of the area .
[P_90] , [P_92] do [P_93] me .
with congressional probes , security guards posted at enron&#39;s headquarters and the recent sacking of an andersen partner , [P_96] like the story&#39;s still got a way to play out .
after focusing the last few editions on the developments surrounding deregulation and energy trading in both the us and europe , we&#39;re taking a [P_98] at two other issues of [P_910] the energy community - emissions and weather .
two of the articles [P_91] the growing market in emissions trading - the first a [P_95] the market , how it&#39;s
[P_90] , where the money&#39;s to be made , and the second article takes a [P_95] at the regulations governing the market .
we&#39;re quickly running out of hotel [P_92] , so if you&#39;re [P_93] to do it [P_96] before space runs out .
although there is still much dissension among the ranks of scientists and environmentalists as to the [P_95] ghg has on the environment , there [P_98] little doubt the earth&#39;s climate is predicted to change because human activities are altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of greenhouse gases ?
few can [P_90] the [P_91] each degree higher or lower than [P_93] temperature , [P_95] on their company&#39;s financial statement .
so for those of you that are anxiously anticipating [P_93] of a [P_94] , global market in the trade of greenhouse gas emissions , with the largest [P_99] buyer participating ... < a 25005
but the initiative to be put [P_92] by the world&#39;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases is likely to spark [P_96] international criticism as it links emission cuts to economic growth rates and fails to require companies to carry out reductions .
the plan , expected to [P_91] as early ... < a 24911

however , he [P_91] at [P_92] necessary .
and i [P_90] i [P_91] put [P_92] it for [P_93] .....
i guess.&nbsp ; i also have head hunters trying to get me into aep and a friend at aquila trying to backdoor [P_97] that joint.&nbsp ; i [P_99] moving my shit just about anywhere in the [P_912] weeks.<br><br></p></div

[P_90] it in [P_91] !
it occurred to me as i sent the message [P_93] michael brown that [P_94] be the lawyer i [P_96] .
sharon butcher and i [P_91] on a project for enron corp. hr that requires research on data protection laws in the various countries in which enron has employees .
it is [P_90] subscribe to clifford [P_93] 's nextlaw service , a database of data protection legislation in various countries .
at the end of my message to christopher , [P_93] the list of countries that [P_95] information about .
if so , i [P_91] to christopher that if ( as i [P_94] ) enron corp. subscribes to nextlaw for [P_97]
sharon and i are [P_91] , enron europe should be entitled to access and use the [P_95] the [P_96] christopher references .
[P_90] tell me which lawyer in [P_92] i should [P_93] discussions .
kelly [P_90] after all this time .
enron 's subscription to nextlaw has indeed expired , though we are starting to [P_94] data protection [P_96] enron europe and were [P_98] show them nextlaw [P_99] we believe it [P_911] to them .
in [P_90] , i [P_91] talk [P_93] and sharon on monday at 09.00 [P_96] about [P_97] might [P_98] project .
i am copying this to my colleague ben ebdon in our clifford [P_94] online group in the [P_95] he will [P_97] to [P_98] on the call on monday .
in [P_90] , i [P_91] have a [P_93] weekend .
enron 's annual subscription lasped several months ago , [P_93] are [P_94] of similar services [P_95] a different hr project .
enron senior [P_90] tasked the hr department with the creation of an internal " expert directory " with which all enron employees can identify other enron employees who have specific [P_910] ( such as language capabilities , [P_912] particular kinds of [P_914] , political contacts , etc . ) [P_917] intiatives .
[P_90] , the data that must be collected from all enron employees worldwide is significantly more complex than the [P_97] were gathering from international employees when we engaged [P_910] previously .
[P_90] now [P_91] legal advice about what consents must be obtained from employees in various foreign jurisdictions in order to collect and publish the information , whether certain information gathered must be requested on a voluntary basis ( and conversely , [P_914] require that employees provide ) , etc .
i am hopeful that in the time since we last spoke , your firm [P_94] jurisdictions to the subscription service , since many of the countries in which we have employees were not on the database in early 1999 .
i [P_90] wondering whether the information included in the database is sufficient for this [P_95] project .
my colleague , sharon butcher , and i [P_92] you [P_95] if clifford [P_97] is again willing [P_98] to [P_99] local research that we require , and to get [P_913] of the cost involved .
we were [P_90] at 9:00 am houston time on monday , may 22nd .
i [P_90] are well , [P_92] our [P_93] .
parts for this unit may not [P_92] monday which , in turn , means unit 5 [P_96] unavailable until then .

texas head coach mack brown has shyed away from giving any indication as to who the starter [P_95] or when [P_97] announced , leaving just speculation as to whether it [P_911] simms or major appplewhite who comes out on the field first sept. 9 against louisiana - lafayette .
but honestly , i [P_91] both of these guys [P_93] in the nfl .
[P_90] a bit too far ahead , but for the quarterback with the regal nfl bloodlines , simms has been taking the situation in stride .
he 's brushed off the endless questions about the issue with ease , and in [P_95] , has [P_96] a string of practices that revealed a much more patient and [P_910] quarterback than the one abruptly thrust into high - pressure situations toward the end of last season .
a guy like chris gives you a lot [P_92] in your quarterback , between his mental [P_95] the game and his physical [P_98] .
he joked the biggest difference in his added strength was " [P_93] my uniform , " but simms does think the extra muscle has given him better arm strength and has increased his [P_911] take a hit , even though brown has not allowed his quarterbacks to be touched this preseason .
i do n't [P_91] i [P_91] do what he [P_93] , " simms said .
i [P_90] run a 4.25 forty off a cliff , but that 's about it .
i [P_90] it out , " simms said .

a close [P_90] signal thew [P_92] towards $ 14.00 [P_93] inevitable for now since the dominant channel is a downward one .
[P_90] also [P_91] we 've had difficulty establishing $ 20.00 as resistance or support ; this is key since [P_97] determine whether the [P_98] move is to $ 24 or $ 17.25 .

the [P_90] deal with eight major areas [P_92] construction dealing with design , density and [P_95] , but not use , of properties . ?
-- [P_90] restrictions would require that any [P_92] facing the street be set back at least halfway to the back lot line , and in [P_98] no [P_910] to the street than the front of the house itself .
[P_90] - dominated front -- a new provision would mandate that a front - facing [P_95] door [P_95] not take up more than a half of the first - floor front of the house , a direct blow at the most common townhome styles . ?
raised foundations -- preserving another dominant characteristic of home construction in the heights , the [P_95] restrictions would require either pier - and - beam construction , or other foundation construction that would raise the bottom floor of the house at least 2 feet from the ground .
height restrictions -- [P_91] would retain the current height restriction of 40 feet , except that for lots of width greater than 50 feet , the limit would go up [P_910] foot for every 2 feet of [P_913] setback from the nearest lot line .
density and lot width -- the minimum lot size [P_93] increased from one residence per every 2,500 square feet to one per every 5,000 [P_98] , and there [P_910] a minimum frontage of 50 feet for each lot .
this [P_90] essentially establish a minimum lot [P_92] of 50 feet by 100 feet .
[P_90] situation , there [P_91] two important exceptions to the [P_94] density and lot width requirements .
second , lots of smaller frontage or size with existing houses as of the date of adoption of [P_96] or other fixed date ( to be determined ) would be " grandfathered .
a bracketed bill enacted by the texas legislature in 1999 , applying only to the heights , created a means by which the deed restrictions could [P_98] changed , setting [P_910] for these [P_911] .
adoption of [P_90] require an affirmative vote of 75 percent of those submitting a ballot .
second , a petition [P_91] mailed or otherwise sent out to all signed - on owners .
adoption [P_90] require the signature of 75 percent of the owners .
the third , and as tiller pointed out by far [P_93] , method [P_94] to call a meeting of signed - on property owners .

this is a partial listing so [P_92] your company [P_94] are in the market for anything in particular , [P_97] .
these are [P_90] properties i am [P_92] , we handle turnkey installations all over the world as well as a [P_97] deal of offshore [P_98] .
delivery can occur within approximately 120 [P_92] days ( 4 months ) after receipt of funds as specified below .
a control room [P_91] provided [P_92] switchgear and circuit disconnects .

[P_90] implement the [P_91] of correlations .
instead of heaving 1 [P_91] based on [P_92] month prices and applying this matrix to all maturities , [P_96] have a number correlation [P_98] each corresponding to a particular [P_910] month .
[P_90] see that : 1 ) [P_92] are close for 5 , 4 , and 3 months of history ; 2 ) correlations are periodic with a period of 1 year ( this means [P_912] use 12 correlation matrices calculated from first 12 [P_915] contracts and apply these [P_917] to other [P_918] months ) ; 3 ) using decay factor makes [P_920] a little smoother .

we should go through each of the regulatory characteristics of japan [P_93] if it applies in hk and then in singapore .
from conversations with clifford [P_91] / hk , already i am pretty certain the hk and probably singapore as well differ from the japan situation in several ways , such as : in [P_911] : - no half circuit requirement .
[P_90] capacity from a properly licensed hk fixed network carrier - [P_94] way for us entity to be used for most of the transaction .
but again , which is [P_91] us , a us entity or a [P_94] kong/ singapore one , tax - wise and regulatory - wise .

however , those talks [P_91] be influenced by whether enron is [P_94] downgraded by major credit - ratings agencies .
ralph pellecchia , credit analyst for fitch , said he [P_93] n't predict what effect the sec filing [P_96] have on enron 's credit rating , but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures .
some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said " it is possible " that continuing enron reviews [P_97] " identify additional [P_98] information concerning these matters .
the enron sec filing gave [P_91] about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the ljm partnerships .

takeunder [P_90] a better term .
that [P_90] not [P_92] enron .
dynegy and chevrontexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy enron 's credit rating -- now just two notches from falling [P_99] grade -- if the agencies [P_911] askance at the current deal .
the companies [P_90] for a response within [P_92] two , the executives said .
the executives also said dynegy was seeking [P_92] protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if [P_96] , adverse disclosures surfaced .
however , the effective industry bailout that the merger [P_93] represent [P_93] lead to some leniency from the f.t.c. , [P_97] looked at with some relief by the f.e.r.c. ' '
mr. plank said he [P_91] regulators would take a critical [P_93] any deal . '
some industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly [P_94] a do - or - die prospect for enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies .
a rating [P_90] - grade [P_92] make it ` ` difficult if not impossible to raise [P_95] debt [P_96] severely hamper their ability to trade , ' ' jefferies & co. energy analyst paul fremont said .

that includes investment partnerships that led to a $ 1.2 billion loss for the company last quarter , as well as other deals formed by the company 's former chief financial officer [P_910] have been a conflict of interest .

government regulators [P_90] have [P_91] a merger , [P_93] too much market concentration would result .
however , i do n't think it 's [P_92] as [P_93] , " he said , adding that a successful merger would take the correct incentives to convince enron 's traders [P_911] for the [P_912] .
if master market maker enron goes down , this winter [P_93] a truly chilling [P_95] north americans.(enron corp. in danger of defaulting)(brief article )
those of us who thought the energy industry would escape the [P_93] technology bear market [P_95] been too complacent .
[P_90] contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron 's ability to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies [P_911] enormous if enron were to default .
but enron has enormous exposure [P_91] deals that have no such protection .
many u.s. energy producers locked in high prices by making huge [P_93] sales .
according to a report filed with the sec , it [P_93] start a chain of full - service , white - tablecloth italian restaurants " based on authentic italian regional [P_910] .
a report on its web site suggests the stock is " [P_93] ground - floor [P_95] [ for the ] investor with vision .
it says the big board has made " significant [P_93] " in regulating brokers , but deficiencies remain : among other things , the nyse needs [P_98] surveillance of floor members , ensuring that regulators are on the trading floor to watch [P_914] violations .
no doubt the nyse 's regulatory [P_92] are commendable -- just [P_93] does n't take another two years for the exchange to get its practices completely up to par .
has produced [P_90] returns than protecting management .
maybe [P_90] for that change .
but buying enron stock in the [P_92] the valuation will turn out to be above the present price [P_96] a slightly ambitious [P_98] even the most well informed investors .
if dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , [P_95] have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern .
also , this is probably a " once in a corporate lifetime " [P_94] to [P_95] a merger of such large companies with the likely quick [P_99] of antitrust regulators .
there was no [P_91] the federal reserve or any other government entity [P_94] or [P_95] step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets .
so enron 's $ 13bn of debt is most likely a [P_93] buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices .
if the companies combined , they would create a $ 21bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy - marketing [P_97] financial resources , " says christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group .
it has also [P_91] to [P_92] wholesale operations well beyond a uk presence .
dynegy 's [P_90] platform , dynegydirect - which helped raise the company 's recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a [P_910] with enron online .
dynegy is also an [P_91] trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron [P_95] bail out its new suitor in the past [P_98] trading losses .
analysts say there would be a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility [P_98] only [P_99] .
most analysts believe a [P_91] , but [P_93] more than a year due to [P_96] and the complexity of the two companies .
[P_90] negative consequence to enron [P_92] both physical commodities prices for electricity and gas as well as have a negative affect on financial energy products .
enron 's demise would not only hurt the thousands with exposure to the group through its trading operations ; it [P_96] have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector .
out of respect for enron 's presence , my sense is the industry [P_94] to give them [P_96] of the doubt [P_97] if they can resolve this situation , " says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie .
the group 's banks , due to meet today , [P_93] secure $ 3.3bn in unsecured [P_95] drawn down in the past month .
but [P_90] not [P_91] to renegotiate the terms unless enron 's situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a default .
in a regulatory filing , enron said it had restated accounts from 1997 to the third quarter of this year , leading to an increase of $ 628 m in debt for the year 2000 , and [P_912] in net income up to the third quarter of this year .
[P_90] cheap , but the stock has collapsed [P_93] reason .
a rescue by dynegy and chevrontexaco corp. , a major dynegy shareholder , [P_94] enron with $ 1.2 billion in cash , according [P_98] familiar with the negotiations .
another [P_90] outcome [P_91] a major investment in enron by dynegy and potentially other energy companies , if the right collateral can be found , sources said .
not everyone has been [P_91] do it .
however , the picture [P_91] even worse .
if so , the ljm2 deals were n't as arms length as [P_94] project right now .
the ljm2 number is certainly [P_91] , but in and of itself the equity number means little when [P_96] at sheer [P_97] of the deals ljm2 and enron did [P_910] .
through the raptor deals , ljm2 agreed to [P_92] enron whole for losses sustained if the assets declined in value , and it [P_97] profit if these assets went up in value .
however , to make hedges of this [P_92] , raptor would 've needed adequate cushion against potential losses .
rival dynegy inc. however , the action still left analysts [P_93] whether [P_94] negative disclosures [P_95] coming .
some analysts suggested the deal has problems [P_92] pose new risks for dynegy .
a massive restatement like this does n't [P_92] .
both trade on [P_91] stock exchange . .
analysts said enron ran into [P_91] its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron [P_97] move off its books .
they protected its credit rating , [P_92] it to obtain [P_93] rates on its corporate borrowings .
the small - cap market [P_91] to post slimmer declines than the overall nasdaq market because of [P_96] of financial stocks , which make up the largest industry group in the russell 2000 following technology .
investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they [P_98] successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications .
wall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy [P_96] enron 's credibility .
but [P_90] always [P_91] much financial visibility [P_93] and steering clear of any company that [P_96] not -- [P_97] not -- provide it .
the domestic lenders have tried to facilitate a meeting between prospective buyers and the seller as we have a common [P_96] saving this power [P_98] going bust , " saxena said .
` ` tata and bses are keen to buy [P_93] but [P_94] the terms enron sets , ' ' said v.k. saxena , chief general manager at industrial development bank of india , or idbi , the country 's second - biggest lender .
but until i see terms of the deal and [P_93] conditions , i 'd be cautious [P_95] any judgements .
on thursday , the wall street journal reported that dynegy and enron are in talks [P_95] lead to a merger in a [P_97] worth $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion .
a merger , according to a number of sources , [P_93] prevent big troubles for many energy companies .
we see this [ [P_91] collapse of enron ] as a situation that [P_94] downsides for the entire industry .
in some ways , [P_91] be a natural [P_93] .

since such transaction [P_91] to [P_92] based upon the credit rating of the entity or the sponsors ( [P_96] upon [P_97] ) [P_98] returns [P_99] not justify the balance sheet [P_911] northern border partners if this entity were to function as lessor .

that [P_90] hugely expensive , because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long - term contracts .
it 's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that [P_94] , [P_94] amount to billions of dollars .

supervisor donna gerber abstained after criticizing the [P_92] potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state 's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state , region and county [P_911] years , and how much power is slated to come online .

desaulnier said he believed a peaker plant [P_92] built about a month after [P_94] .
supervisors also heard from [P_91] developers of a 650-megawatt plant between bay point and concord .

while competition in the backbone network business is booming , new technologies coming into the market [P_95] it much [P_96] increase bandwidth available [P_98] fiber - optic network tenfold or more .
and that step [P_91] more difficult than building the networks themselves . '
the combination of [P_91] network construction and [P_92] technology [P_93] network capacity has led industry analysts and executives to [P_97] a bandwidth glut that is [P_99] to drive down prices in backbone transport of data much as the price of long - distance telephony has plummeted in the past few years .
rather than a free fall in prices , however , [P_93] the market to [P_94] ways to use bandwidth , both in terms of network - based [P_99] bigger backbone networks to support the rapidly growing [P_913] faster access [P_914] digital subscriber line ( dsl ) and cable modems .

[P_90] this network will drive cost down and increase [P_93] value - added applications which [P_95] delivered over an ip network .
in addition to [P_91] , however , the sudden availability of bandwidth will dramatically change the way services are priced and sold .
it 's the [P_91] great challenge of the internet - deciding [P_93] are going to bill customers and what they [P_97] willing to pay for , " analyst bernstein says .

we have a [P_91] relationship , i believe , with bpub , the port of brownsville and their respective counsel from that transaction .
john also seems to believe the deals with bpub and the port [P_94] structured along the same lines as the transmission [P_97] , and as the draftsmen for not only the docs with bpub , but also the port , we are also obviously [P_915] documents as well .

indeed , unless you simply have n't been keeping [P_93] the stories of how brokers are getting rich with big commissions , and feel a bizarre [P_99] help out the brokerage community , [P_911] maintain a strong bias against annuities .
those payments may [P_91] some date in [P_92] or they [P_94] start on the day you buy the contract .
[P_90] in the annuity [P_91] a return , and those [P_94] grow untaxed until you receive annuity payments .
a fixed annuity thus provides a steady retirement income -- but this steady return [P_94] eroded by inflation .
for those [P_90] live many years , the added cost of this feature [P_94] worth the price , but [P_97] to pay dearly for this option .
while these subaccounts [P_91] invest [P_91] a mutual fund , subaccounts almost certainly [P_94] a different and higher expense structure , and possibly a far different return than that of the public mutual fund .
still , over the long - term , a variable annuity invested in a stock subaccount should [P_95] a [P_96] inflation - protected income than a fixed annuity .
a recent innovation in the insurance industry , an equity - index annuity is a form of a fixed annuity contract tied to a stock index that provides [P_99] to earn returns better than those in a traditional fixed annuity , but less than those of a direct investment in the market itself .

traders and brokers said they [P_91] dynegy [P_92] some kind of guarantee to enron 's trading to restore confidence .
but , after enron 's [P_91] transact took a severe turn for the worse nov. 20 , dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and [P_911] .
for the first time since enron 's troubles began a [P_93] , energy companies stopped selling to enron in the spot markets for fear that [P_98] not [P_99] to pay its bills [P_911] as [P_912] based on the quarterly filing .
the buyout offer , finalized nov. 9 , would have had dynegy paying about $ 10.41 for each share of enron , but enron 's shares have since cratered to [P_910] $ 4 , stoking investor fears the merger [P_913] not go through [P_914] - [P_915] all .
but as enron 's stock continued to lose value , down over 50 percent since dynegy 's initial bid , it seemed [P_97] purchase price would fall as well .

still , reports that the equity swap ratio offered by dynegy [P_93] revised down to [P_95] 0.15 from 0.2685 , [P_97] hedge funds , often willing to take more risks , [P_911] place trades on the deal .
we 're trying to figure out a [P_92] play , " said a trader at a [P_95] york hedge fund .
so far , bets under consideration seem to [P_92] that would include a combination of stock and debt trading , somehow hedging a short position on enron 's shares with a long position in some of its bonds .
some bids are coming in , especially on the lower priced bonds , " said a trader at a large [P_96] investment bank that makes a market in enron 's bonds .
at the same time it has become much [P_92] hedge that loss potential by going [P_95] enron bonds .
but the situation is so volatile that it 's difficult to be aggressive , " the manager of a large [P_96] hedge fund said .
