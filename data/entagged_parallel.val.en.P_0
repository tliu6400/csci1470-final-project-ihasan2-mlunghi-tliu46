families of executives overseeing u.s. energy giant enron corp 's troubled dabhol power company ( dpc ) project in india are leaving the country , possibly signalling an intention to terminate the nearly complete $ 2.9 billion project , an india newspaper said on wednesday .
the times of india said the children of enron executives had been pulled out of the american school in bombay as their families were being relocated to singapore .
a spokesman for dabhol power co , the operator of the nearly complete 2,184 mw power plant south of bombay , told reuters it was company policy not to comment on administrative and personnel matters .
the project is mired in controversy after the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) reneged on its commitment to buy all the power produced by the giant plant , saying it is too costly .
officials of the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , in a presentation made before the maharashtra electricity regulatory commission ( merc ) , today refuted claims that the board underutilised its own capacity to justify power purchase from enron 's dabhol power company .
no pressure from indian federal govt on enron issue : mseb 05/09/2001
asia pulse pte ltd. new delhi , may 9 asia pulse - the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has said that there is no pressure from the federal government on the state government to continue its agreement with us energy giant enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) .
mseb had delayed the monthly payments of electricity bills from october last year and subsequently defaulted on payments , claiming that the cost of power produced by dpc was exorbitant .
it also slapped two penalty bills of around rs 800 crore on enron for failing to generate electricity within the stipulated time period of three hours .
enron subsequently has invoked state guarantees , counter - guarantees and political force majeure , and then went on to invoke the arbitration clause .
sjm demands probe into enron deal the times of india news service 05/09/2001
ramesh seth , convener of sjm , mumbai and anil gachke , convener of sjm 's national action group on power , have alleged that while examining the feasibility of the project , inflated and fabricated figures of demand for power were given by those in power .
the maharashtra state electricity board has stated to the maharashtra electricity regulatory commission ( merc ) that mseb 's plans to generate more power from its idle uran plant in order to avoid expensive dabhol power , are unlikely to materialise due to the high costs involved .
in a hearing that took place on tuesday , against a petition filed by sr paranjpe , mseb officials made it clear to the commission that it has to pay rs 16,000 per tonne for furnace oil to rashtriya chemicals & fertilisers ( rcf ) which makes the power costlier from uran .
the petition had challenged that mseb had violated the merit order despatch and purchased more power from enron violating the limits set by merc in its may 5 order .
it is our corporate policy not to comment on personnel and administrative matters , " he said .
we have no extra security than is absolutely necessary " , he maintained .
mseb is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has absolved dpc of all its liabilities .
the dpc board authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to mseb and the state government .

raider coach mike leach , who had poked fun at texas cbs quentin jammer and rod babers and qb chris simms in pre - game comments , gave them little credit in his post - game interview , then bristled when a lubbock reporter asked him about all the short passes raider qb kliff kingsbury threw .

simms led the longhorns 80 yards in 11 plays , hitting five straight passes , all of them to wr roy williams , for 49 yards .

state regulators , led by the new york public service commission , argue that the ferc 's rulemaking preempted state authority under the 1935 federal power act .
enron corp. ( ene ) , maintains the commission did n't go far enough in asserting its authority over interstate power markets .
congress in the federal power act left retail power rate regulation to the states , while giving the federal power commission , the ferc 's predecessor , authority to regulate electricity in interstate commerce .
the ferc 's open - access transmission mandate interpreted the 1992 energy policy act , which sought to spur competition in wholesale power markets .
but those wholesale transmission services " bundled " with retail electricity service were left within state ratemaking authority by the ferc .
however , the ferc asserted jurisdiction over state - regulated wholesale transmission in the event states opened their retail power markets to competition , effectively " unbundling " the wholesale transmission component of the formerly bundled transaction .
utilities are reserving more transmission capacity than needed to serve their retail customers as a means of blocking competitive entry at wholesale , enron and other competitive power providers argue .
the ferc 's " determination that it lacks jurisdiction over the majority of interstate transmission uses has created an unnecessary and unacceptable regulatory gap over the interstate transmission that a utility claims is used to serve retail customers , " the electric power supply association , which represents competitive power providers , told the court .
the justice department , on behalf of the ferc , argued in defense of the status quo under the 1996 rules , as did the edison electric institute , the trade group representing investor - owned utilities .
order no . 888 , as the ferc calls its open - access rulemaking , " respects the division of federal and state authority drawn by congress in the ( federal power act ) , while taking into account the changes that have taken place since the act was enacted , " edison electric institute said .
tata power , the nation 's biggest non - state power company , last month said it was interested in buying dabhol power only if enron lowers its price and the federal government
` ` i made it clear to them that the project is not durable unless it is financially re - engineered and the tariff reduced to an affordable level , ' ' the agency quoted bses chairman r.v. shahi as saying .
enron also contested the order , saying it did n't go far enough to ensure competition .
california example critics of deregulation point to surging prices in california , one of about 25 states opening their power market to competition .
the commission made an exception in its order for utilities that charge customers one combined rate for power and its transmission , a so - called ` ` bundled ' ' sale .
the rules ` ` usurp state power to ensure reliable local distribution of electricity over hundreds of thousands of miles of poles , wires and transformers , ' ' the state argued in its appeal to the supreme court .
the court said ferc ca n't force a utility that must restrict grid access because of capacity constraints to give electricity from competitive suppliers the same access as its own power .
how far the commission reigns over transmission is why this case is before the supreme court , hoecker said .

to protect public health and the environment , epa administrator carol m. browner today announced that the clinton administration will require reductions , for the first time ever , of harmful mercury emissions from coal - fired power plants -- the largest source of such emissions in america .
" mercury from power plants settles over waterways , polluting rivers and lakes , and contaminating fish .
the greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants , and they have never been required to control these emissions before now .
under the clean air act , epa is required to study toxic air pollution from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect public health .
that study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined , mercury posed the greatest concern to public health .
today , epa is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated , because mercury poses the greatest hazards to public health .
the clinton administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions to reduce mercury air pollution , including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors , medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors .
the president highlighted the benefits of adopting a combined strategy to address all of the major pollutants emitted by power plants , including mercury , sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide .
the unequivocal ruling by leon county circuit judge terry lewis rejecting the plea by democrats and affirming that florida secretary of state katherine harris did indeed exercise her discretion in rejecting the hand recounts totals represents a stunning setback for vice president al gore .
it means the certification of the florida vote is likely to proceed on saturday , with secretary of state harris certain to declare bush the winner and give florida 's 25 electoral votes to bush and thus put him over the top with 271 electoral votes .
but as the legal options dwindle , and the court of public opinion becomes even more important , the lewis ruling and the inevitable harris certification ( barring intercession by florida 's supreme court ) tomorrow provides the republicans with a powerful public relations weapon to turn public opinion sharply in favor of calling the race over .

dear friends : on tuesday night , republican randy forbes was elected to represent one of the most competitive , democratic - leaning districts in america : virginia 's 4th congressional district .
president clinton won the 4th district in 1992 and 1996 , and republican senate candidates lost the district in 1998 and 2000 ( even while they won statewide ) .
so what does this history - defying republican victory mean to us on a national level ?

the result , said stuart rothenberg , an independent analyst of congressional campaigns , is that the race looms as ' a sort of referendum on george w. bush , on the energy issue , on social security and on the direction of the country . '
california ; metro desk electricity cost data spread the blame power : many suppliers charged more than the firms that davis has pilloried , records show .
rich connell ; robert j. lopez ; doug smith times staff writers 07/10/2001
during the first three months of this year -- one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis -- an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to texas firms , according to documents released to the times on monday by the department of water resources , which now buys power for california .
among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt - hour were a canadian public utility , a subsidiary of san diego gas & electric 's parent company , and the los angeles department of water and power , the report shows .
in fact , some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by davis and other state officials -- dynegy inc. , duke energy and mirant -- charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period .
the figures cover the various types of spot and longer - term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor - thin reserves , leading to continuous power emergencies .
just because there are other entities who are charging us more [ per megawatt - hour ] does n't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from houston , tulsa , atlanta or charlotte .
for example , houston - based enron , one of the nation 's biggest power traders , charged an average of $ 181 per megawatt - hour .
and atlanta - based mirant , which sold the most to the state , a total of $ 706 million , charged an average of $ 225 per megawatt - hour .
by contrast , a calgary , canada , firm , transalta energy , averaged $ 335 a megawatt - hour , and the sacramento municipal utility district had average charges of $ 330 per megawatt - hour .
is there some compelling reason why performance is necessary ?

for the first time calling it an " energy crisis , " davis enumerated steps he has taken , then said he has fought " tooth and nail against raising rates .
we are not in this business to bail out these guys , " said senate president pro tem john burton ( d - san francisco ) .
the governor took the unusual step of reserving air time on statewide television at a time when he is slipping in polls and surveys show that the public is increasingly concerned about the energy crisis .
the speech took on greater urgency as the california independent system operator , the entity that oversees power distribution , warned thursday that the state will face 34 days of rotating blackouts if consumers and businesses use the same amount of electricity this summer that they did last year .
in his speech , davis renewed his call to californians to curtail electricity use by at least 10 % , even as a new report was issued warning that the state faces repeated summer blackouts because of a major gap in the supply of power during the coming months .
the talk lasted a mere five minutes , delivered in fewer than 800 words .
davis blamed the rate hikes on rising natural gas prices , a lack of adequate generation and the federal government 's refusal to cap wholesale power prices .
under the proposal , which requires public utilities commission approval , people who use up to 200 % of their baseline allocation would see rates on that portion of their electricity use go up by 9 % , plus the 9 % already imposed for a total of 18 % .
electricity users who consume more than twice their baseline allocation would pay between 33 % and 37 % more for kilowatts used beyond 200 % of their baseline allocation .
the public is more aware of what is going on on this issue than any other issue i have seen , ever , " said democratic political consultant gale kaufman .
other political consultants said davis used television to get his message out because newspaper accounts have raised questions about his handling of the situation .
he is not doing well with the print story , " said republican consultant wayne c. johnson , " so he has decided to change venues .
it 's pretty clear : the public is angry and scared , " said state sen. don perata ( d - alameda ) .

the california statute which governs such discovery exchanges states that a party claiming to have been injured from trade secret misappropriation may obtain another party?s trade secret records only if it identifies the relevant trade secrets with ? reasonable particularity . ?
the purpose behind the statute clearly is to protect responding parties from fishing expeditions being launched outside the scope of the dispute which is the subject of the lawsuit .
moreover , it is extremely vulnerable to destruction during litigation as its disclosure can destroy its secret quality and hence its value .
finally , and most importantly , as parties to trade secret litigation are usually competitors , revelation of trade secret information by one to the other tends to have direct and harmful consequences .

still , such transfers of assets were fundamental to deregulation plans in two dozen states , and they were encouraged by federal rules designed to build a new wholesale marketplace in electricity .
eight of the nation 's 10 largest power marketers are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities , controlling about 42 percent of power trading .
it is largely these unregulated power producers and traders whose sales of power in california have prompted accusations by state leaders of price gouging , and demands for the price caps that federal regulators took their first , halting steps toward embracing last week .

' ' several hundred million dollars did n't get spent for maintenance , and that ultimately falls to the bottom line as profit , ' '
mr. glynn said the utility had always spent appropriate sums on maintenance , coming within one - half of one percent of the amount built into rates over a 20-year period .

in a result that 's sure to surprise many business schools and students alike , esade of spain , insead of france and imd of switzerland beat such elite american institutions as columbia university , the university of california at los angeles and the massachusetts institute of technology .

it was briefly mentioned in a conference call with analysts , but many of the listeners seem to have not noticed that , wrongly thinking kenneth l. lay , enron 's chairman and chief executive , was referring to a $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings release .
enron emphasizes its own version of earnings , which leaves out some expenses , and directs attention away from its balance sheet , which is disclosed only in s.e.c. filings , not in the earnings news release .
earlier this year , jeffrey skilling , then enron 's chief executive , reacted strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to provide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released .
mr. skilling later resigned for what he said were personal reasons and mr. lay , the chairman and former chief executive , took back the latter title .

i conclude by arguing that , while a finding of market power in an industry does not necessarily indicate that government intervention is warranted , such analysis is an important part of creating sound public policy .
pricing electricity for these default customers is now an issue before the california public utilities commission .
in california this issue is framed largely in terms of two alternatives : pass through of the wholesale electricity price or a performance - based rate ( pbr ) .

best , jeff ferc judge urges dismissal of calif complaint vs el paso
an administrative law judge has recommended the u.s. federal energy regulatory commission dismiss a complaint alleging
el paso pipeline and el paso merchant had the ability to exercise market power , the record in this case is n't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power , " curtis wagner , ferc 's chief administrative law judge , concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late tuesday .
the california public utilities commission , which filed the complaint against el paso , said later tuesday that it would appeal wagner 's decision on market manipulation .
but while that market share gave el paso the " ability to exercise market power , " wagner said , " it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that el paso merchant and el paso pipeline exercised market power .
wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that el paso violated ferc rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another .
wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to william wise , el paso 's chief executive , from the head of el paso merchant as contributing to his conclusion that el paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates " were in clear violation " of ferc 's affiliate - abuse rules .
el paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its march 28 ruling .

the blonde then pinned the note to the kid 's shirt and sent him home to show it to his parents .
gov. gray davis and his hand - picked head of the california public utilities commission , loretta lynch .
davis is essentially a passive , reactive and self - protective politician , and his tendencies served him - and the store - poorly when the crisis first arose last summer .
of lynch , waters said , " legislators from both parties are ready to lynch the president of the state public utilities commission for , they say , consistently refusing to cooperate and feeding them blatantly false accounts .
southern california edison took the extraordinary step of issuing a highly detailed critique that stopped just short of accusing lynch of lying , and the legislature 's chief auditor is ready to sue her to obtain information on the puc 's role .
i 'm reminded of an old shoe cartoon by the late jeff macnelly , in which a heavy - set politician stands at a podium in a news conference and makes the accusation , " you in the media are playin ' fast and loose with the facts .
one of the stogie - smoking hacks responds , " how 's that ?
what did we do to the facts ?
the politician replies , " you printed the dang things ! "
davis demonstrated his rather loose , clintonian , connection with the truth late last month when he proudly announced that bids for long - term electricity supply in response to the state 's solicitation had come in an at " weighted average " of $ 69/mwh .
calling the action " an abuse of power , " sce ceo john bryson said the order is " an insult to the ethic of the 13,000 employees of sce who have worked to keep the lights on for their customers .

economists recall his drunken 1994 appearance on cnn 's moneyline , during which he unleashed a profanity - laden tirade against bureau of engraving & printing director larry rolufs and punched host lou dobbs when he challenged greenspan 's reluctance to lower interest rates .
when asked about u.s. treasury secretary paul o'neill 's speech at the women entrepreneurs conference on march 19th , greenspan was overheard saying " what a waste of paul 's time .

waiting for a crisis is excruciating for folks who think of themselves as caregivers when it comes to organizing care for people who have less and less capacity to take care of themselves or their personal surroundings .
do they fear that harm will come to their parent ?
are they concerned that a crisis will interrupt the normal course of their own lives ?
the frustration faced by folks who see loved ones failing to take proper care of themselves is phenomenal .
it can not prevent a crisis from happening ; and it is crucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened by forcing the ' victim ' of it to lose face .
looking at oneself and saying , " it 's not my fault , " is not a way of avoiding blame , but rather giving a loved one the freedom to make their own mistakes -- just as they did the first time they gave us the keys to the car .

not only does it have no environmental benefit but there 's no point bitching and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to the cost of gas .
yet that 's what governor davis and the anal attorney are demanding : price caps .
but it expects those companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service california -- i.e. , hollywood and silicon valley -- as an act of public welfare .
gray davis is acting not like the elected governor of an american state but the appointed governor of a crown colony , feverishly cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him .

six months after jumping into the electricity business , the davis administration on monday provided the first detailed glimpse of california 's daily power purchases , showing more than $ 5 billion in payments , much of it to government - owned utilities and private companies that state officials have branded as price gougers .
the figures were disclosed late monday by the california department of water resources , which buys power for the state 's financially strapped major utilities , and seem to buttress the administration 's contention that the price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for what prompted the decrease .
used for support republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks against davis , a democrat , for signing long - term contracts with power generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down , partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants .
on any given day , the records show , the prices from seller to seller varied widely , with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and companies outside texas .

rep. rob portman , r - ohio , who chairs house gop leadership meetings , told congressdaily that the most tangible difference since sen. james jeffords , i - vt . , decided last month to bolt the republican party was " a little more sensitivity by the white house and our leadership in reaching out to moderates ...
our moderates went to jeffords and their message was , ` our views are being taken into consideration , ' " blunt said , pointing to efforts by reps . christopher shays and nancy johnson of connecticut , among others , to persuade jeffords to stay put .

this action would ensure that the 1st district is never without representation in washington , " largent said .
during his tenure , largent has earned a reputation as a champion of christian conservative causes .

a former u.s. postal service union steward who was harassed by co - workers after being ousted from her union post failed to show that the harassment was linked to her sex , the second circuit rules ( " brown v. henderson , " 2d cir .
affirming summary judgment for the postal service on the title vii of the 1964 civil rights act claim by madeline e. brown , judge calabresi finds that while the harassment included sexually charged behavior , it stemmed from a union - related dispute , not that brown was a woman .
here ... there is overwhelming evidence that the hostility toward brown was grounded in workplace dynamics unrelated to her sex and that even [ the obscene ] pictures [ posted near brown 's desk ] did not reflect an attack on brown " as a woman " , " the court concludes . . . .

the pertinent provisions of the pennsylvania labor law were modeled on the pre-1947 version of the nlra , under which mushroom workers were not considered agricultural laborers , the court says .
it is therefore appropriate for the courts to also enforce a consistent interpretation unless and until the general assembly alters course .

enron 's problems came to a head on aug. 14 , when it announced that jeffrey k. skilling , the chief executive , had quit for personal reasons .
marcus and his staff spent more than a week researching and answering more than 100 written questions submitted by the 500 or so people who attended an aug. 22 community meeting that was intended as a public introduction of the proposal .

over the two years , he said , mseb had paid dpc rs 17 billion as its monthly payments and as opposed to it the loss making board could recover only rs 3.50 billion to rs four billion , thus incurring a loss of rs 13.4 billion .
india 's prime minister , atal behari vajpayee , said today that the national government would intervene in a bitter dispute between the enron corporation and the state - run utility in maharashtra state over power from the dabhol power company , which enron controls . '
in may , dabhol began the legal process of severing its contract with the utility ; the utility retaliated by immediately halting power purchases , and the plant has been shut down .
even as prime minister atal bihari vajpayee promised every effort by his government to broker an " amicable solution " to the blocked dabhol power project , union finance secretary ajit kumar convened yet another meeting here on friday with his power and law counterparts and representatives of financial institutions to discuss an acceptable ( to the union ) response to enron corporation 's offer of sale of its majority equity in dabhol .

in the section of the memorandum discussing why the petition is properly before the court ( section iv ) , we are discussing why an application for rehearing is unnecessary .
such argument appears to run counter to our contentions that because of the lack of hearing in this proceeding , the commission 's decision lacks the support it needs or , on the flip side , denied us the opportunity to put on evidence to show the suspension of direct access was unnecessary .
( e ) of the memorandum arguing that the impairment of contracts ordered by the commission is not reasonable or appropriate , we state that the commission 's motive is not the announced purpose , that its purpose instead is malevolent as illustrated by the rhetoric directed at out of state energy companies .
i do n't think such an argument adds anything and , although it maybe true , at this stage it probably is not a good idea to assert that the commission is purposely hurting the state to get back at the out of state energy companies .
the argument is that the commission acted contrary to state and federal constitutional guaranties ( a de novo standard of review ) and that the commission acted in excess of its authority and contrary to law therebya busing its discretion ( a substantial evidence standard of review ) .

calif. utilities seek iso power price cap cut to $ 100 . ?
( reuters ) - pacific gas and electric co ( pg&e ) said wednesday it is joining with southern california edison and a california consumer group to seek a reduction of the independent system operator ( iso ) price cap for electricity to $ 100.00 per megawatt hour ( mwh ) from the current $ 250.00 cap .
calif. pgosaid the request was backed by the utility reform network ( turn ) , a san francisco - based consumer group that has protested against soaring electricity prices as a result of california 's bid to deregulate its electricity industry .
the move by pgoand edison follows a summer of chaos in the california power market , where a shortage of electricity generated within the state and open market power pricing sent the cost of wholesale power to nearly twice its historical average , frequently trading above the proposed $ 100.00 cap .

the following is a transcript of governor gray davis ' remarks on the federal energy regulatory commission 's ( ferc ) report : " my goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable .
however , they did not , as i encouraged , order rebates to the consumers and businesses in san diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that san diego had to suffer through . "
i have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in san diego that say , ' please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us . '
once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996 , the puc basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for california and that control reverted to the federal energy regulatory commission .
so it is unclear whether we have the authority to , independent of the ferc to establish our own iso and power exchange .
as i told everyone involved in this process , some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state .
we are not going to take this lying down .
again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about 35 - 40 % of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them .
ferc has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own iso and our own power exchange

his amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot , and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small , tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water .
he was , in short , neither more nor less than an obese , jocund , multigenarian gnome , the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being .
by rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side , he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless .
he then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance , directed a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden , and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable chiefly among the seed - bearing portions of a common weed .
but i overheard his parting exclamation , audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility : " ecstatic yuletide to the planetary constituency , and to that self same assemblage , my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between sunset and dawn .

on this day , 40 people , including mr. carey sloan ( chairman ) and mr. tatsuro seguchi ( president ) left e power , and mr. j o'day ( sic ) , who used to be the vice president of enron japan , assumed the office of president and ceo of e power .
another cause -a hidden cause - of e power 's downfall was surely the fact that the company held up high a flag that showed the five - letter word " enron " .
enron probably would argue its case by saying that people have no right to complain because the company had observed applicable laws and contracts .
not unlike the us government which does not recognize that one of the major reasons for the recent terrorist attacks on the united states was due to the shortcomings in its middle east - islam policy , enron too does not understand the key elements in doing business in japan .

a bankruptcy court judge may decide the outcome of a lawsuit filed against the calpx and gov. gray davis by duke energy ( duk ) , which alleged that forward power contracts held by the calpx and seized by the governor were done so unlawfully .
enron and the other suppliers sued the calpx in federal court in attempt to block the calpx from holding the companies ' responsible for pg&e and socal ed defaults .

in the private sector , he notes , mr. bush 's successful former executives had ' ' the undiffused power to implement their individual corporate visions . ' ' not in washington . '
' when you are a cabinet secretary , you observe , listen , testify , subject everyone to interagency review , get resistance from congress , and then , more often than not , someone else decides . ' ' that should have come as no surprise to mr. cheney , mr. rumsfeld or mr. o'neill , who all had previous experience in government . ' '
' take mr. cheney -- former congressman , former white house chief of staff , former defense secretary .
now , in a classic washington battle , the general accounting office is demanding to know who mr. cheney met with as his task force developed its policy in secret sessions , and he has refused to reveal the list , fueling suspicions about who has his ear . ' '
now mr. bush is trying to undo the damage , showing up in places like sequoia national forest , restoring $ 300 million in federal money for energy conservation that mr. cheney cut out of the budget , and calling for americans to use energy efficient devices that mr. cheney ignored .
but it 's unclear who is setting financial strategy -- mr. o'neill or the white house chief economic adviser , larry lindsey -- and that has many of america 's economic partners unsettled . '
for example , when asked if it was smart to keep pressing for the elimination of the corporate tax at a time the administration is under fire for being too cozy with corporate america , the former alcoa chief dismissed the whole issue .

he headed the nation 's largest municipal utility when it was one of the few power providers in california to avoid the pain of deregulation .
he also was one of the first public officials to talk tough about power generators when energy prices soared , routinely accusing them of committing " highway robbery " and " ripping off " consumers .
yet freeman himself has been accused of selling surplus power at premium rates as head of the dwp .
it distinguishes me from all the mealy - mouthed wusses who talk in language people do n't understand , " he said .
freeman 's faith in public power goes back to his days growing up in the shadow of the tennessee valley authority , the grandaddy of all public power projects .
president lyndon johnson made him the nation 's first coordinator of energy policy , a role he maintained under presidents nixon and carter .
david freeman has an almost religious belief in public power , " said jan smutny - jones , executive director of the independent energy producers association , which represents major providers such as enron , reliant and dynegy .
he 's reinventing history and people are n't calling him on it because they 're trying to latch on to his star , " said d'arcy , who worked with freeman after he took over the dwp in 1997 .
d'arcy said freeman actually favored selling outdated dwp plants because plenty of cheap power was then available on the spot market .
he said the agency charged reasonable rates for power under state guidelines , but critics said freeman 's opportunism undercuts his verbal assaults on private generators .
however , he said energy providers are being unfairly targeted by accusations of price gouging .

as the clock ticks , rifts remain in calif. electricity refund talks david ivanovich , laura goldberg staff 07/07/2001
washington - california gov. gray davis vowed friday not to back down on his demands electric power companies cough up $ 8.9 billion for overcharging the state for electricity in the midst of a power crisis .
but with a monday deadline fast approaching and the rhetoric still confrontational , the two sides still sounded far from a negotiated settlement .
in a report filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission friday titled " myths debunked : the real story of wholesale power costs in california , " reliant assailed the " disingenuous attempts . . . to paint the picture that independent generators have been principal beneficiaries of the increase in wholesale power costs in california .
joe bob perkins , president of reliant energy 's wholesale group , argued in an interview that the higher wholesale prices in california were not caused by generators trying to push up their operating margins .
gary ackerman , executive director of the western power trading forum , a trade association of wholesale power buyers and sellers in the western states , argued that " if the state of california insists on its fictitious number of $ 8.9 billion , that wo n't help the negotiations any , " he said .
summary : about $ 15 billion in refund claims for electricity overcharges is at issue at a settlement conference ordered by ferc optimistic that he can meet a looming deadline , a judge on friday pushed to keep a surge of momentum going in talks to settle as much as $ 15 billion in refund claims for electricity overcharges across the west .
wagner said he dropped the threat after it served its purpose and to avoid jeopardizing a deal before monday , when the clock runs out on the 15-day settlement conference ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission .
oregon and washington are among the parties at the meeting , which is aimed at discharging financial and legal claims spawned by california 's power deregulation fiasco and the staggering wholesale electricity prices it exported .
power suppliers such as reliant energy , mirant , dynegy , enron and duke energy dismiss charges of price gouging and counter that they have n't been paid for billions of dollars worth of electricity sales into california .
caught in a complicated middle ground are such northwest utilities as portland general electric , pacificorp , puget sound energy , avista utilities , idaho power , plus the bonneville power administration and many consumer - owned utilities .
there are so many parties in it , it 's hard to keep them all in my head , " the judge said , explaining that some parties were represented in both offers .
that 's one reason why he considered putting out his own preliminary refund plan .

but they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of tv ads financed by republicans and power companies are attacking davis .
davis ' ads convey the same information as a series of state- financed " flex your power " ads run by the department of consumer affairs , only those ads do n't mention davis .
davis ' campaign fund , worth well above $ 25 million , is paying for the $ 150,000-per - week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions .
south dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the tv ads that make davis a target , saying the governor 's poll numbers are actually going up .
he said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as ridiculous , particularly one showing davis in red square .
one of the reasons we chose this ( ' energy update ' ) tack , " south said , " is that people simply are not in the mood to have some full- out firefight and some partisan battle about this problem .
stutzman said he did n't disagree with south about the ill - timed and partisan nature of the tv ads , which are financed out of washington , d.c. , but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own .
these ads , even though the the first iteration of them sound like public service ads , very much are political ads , " stutzman said .
last month , a conservative group with links to republicans and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming davis for the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from " grayouts .
time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the ads attacking davis , who has accused texas firms such as reliant energy of " unconscionable price - gouging .
scott reed , a former campaign manager for bob dole 's failed 1996 presidential bid , formed the american taxpayers alliance in washington to raise money for the 30-second ads .
but the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy .
davis recently hired former clinton - gore campaign and white house strategists chris lehane and mark fabiani , and davis ' public presence and political pull dramatically increased .

amended complaint in amalgamated bank v. lay , et al .
mike peterson , who many of you have met and who is working with j.c. on your case , asked me to send the following e - mail to you : the lawyers for amalgamated bank filed an amended class action complaint yesterday .
based on our initial comparison of the amended complaint versus the original one ( our comparison was " line by line " but not " word for word " ) , it appears that the only change was to add four specific requests for relief at the very end of the complaint - namely , " to order an accounting of insider - trading proceeds , " " disgorgement of insider - trading proceeds , " " restitution of investors ' monies of which they were defrauded , " and " as to the section 11 claims , awarding rescission or a rescissionary measure of damages .
the amended complaint does not appear to contain any revision of the factual allegations or asserted causes of action .
the reasons being is that most of the little people in a company of this size never really get their voices heard on any issue , and being a contractor make it even harder so
another concern was , will a person like yourself really have time in your busy schedule to read and answer every e - mail , phone call all or written correspondence he receives from an employee .

it 's obvious that californians would rather send to washington , someone who can inspire a hit tv program like the " west wing " , two liberal senators ( one of whom is the shrillest , most hypocritical apologist in political history ) and a vast majority of liberals to the u.s. house while rejecting decent people like jim rogan , steve kynendall and brian bilbray .

washington , july 24 ( bloomberg ) -- the u.s. government agency that regulates interstate electricity prices should get expanded authority to oversee all public and cooperative power utilities , the chairman of the senate 's energy panel said .
the federal energy regulatory commission approves wholesale interstate electricity rates for investor - owned utilities and power sellers , such as
the agency also would get authority over rates charged for power within states , not just interstate transmissions .
he cited the pipeline affiliates ' code - of - conduct rules and the dispute over refunds to california by power generators .
although houston - based enron owns no major power plants in california , it has adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high .

to avoid " wearing the jacket , " ( in our chicago patois ) , california 's voter - shy public officials and utility executives are blaming bad ol' deregulation .
in fact , it was the lack of retail , customer - level competition that allowed the wholesale market to fly completely out of control .
in california , once a utility finishes collecting " stranded - cost " charges to pay off investments in nuclear plants and high - cost power contracts , price caps for plain , old utility service based on rates in place prior to deregulation are lifted .
that 's why san diego gas & electric , the first utility to finish collecting stranded costs , merely had the job of acquiring power in the wholesale market and passing along the cost to customers who had not switched to new competitive suppliers .
illinois and the midwest have stayed away from such rube goldberg contraptions as the california power exchange that was supposed to serve as a sort of mandatory clearing house for wholesale power transactions but instead became a sort of private regulator that regulated no better than the government used to .

10/16/01 partisanship is the question for senate battle :
leader daschle decides to move quickly toward a bipartisan senate package that tries to isolate the house republicans and their business tax cutting agenda daschle will present dilemma to president bush and his senior advisers .
although senate process is controlled by democrats , senate finance committee chairman baucus ( dem ) is in a highly contested re - election campaign next year in a deeply republican state .
likely elements of the democratic senate package : rebates for those who pay payroll taxes but did not get the first $ 300 or $ 600 rebate .
there are a series of senior democrats who argue that an early compromise could be a major mistake since house republicans will simply " pocket the concessions we make toward republican - style tax cutting and press on with their business tax cutting agenda during the conference committee .
more rebate checks both house and senate agree there should be a rebate for those workers who did not get the earlier rebate because they did not earn enough to pay income taxes ( that 's the bottom 34 million ) .

that offense will prosper against an iowa state defense that allowed 4.5 yards per rush to northern iowa in their only game this season .
the cyclones have historically been horrible defending the run and they even allowed 4.4 ypr last season despite having two defensive lineman that were taken in the 3rd and 7th round of the nfl draft last spring .
while the bobcats ' offense figures to flourish , the defense is good enough to contain a cyclones ' attack that tallied just 337 total yards against northern iowa .
do n't be fooled by the 45 points that iowa state put on the scoreboard in that game as northern iowa turned the ball over 7 times , leading to short drives of just 18 yards , 13 yards and 15 yards .
ohio returns 8 starters to a defense that allowed just 19 points per game last year and held iowa state to 25 points and minnesota to 17 points in two road games against good offensive teams from major conferences .
however , quarterback matt lovecchio struggled last week against nebraska ( 3.7 yards per pass ) and i do n't see the irish doing much damage through the air against a michigan state secondary that is still very good even without injured star cb cedric henry .
the terrapins ' strength is their pass defense , as they have limited their two opponents to just 3.0 yards per pass play ( including sacks ) while picking off 5 passes .
maryland has allowed only 3.0 yards per pass play in their two games against bad offensive teams and i calculate that they would have allowed 3.9 yards per pass play if they played at that same level against a pair of averaging throwing teams .
maryland has averaged 4.8 yards per rushing play ( not including sacks ) in their first two games while averaging 5.1 yards per pass play ( including sacks ) with quarterback shaun hill in the game .
the wake forest defense should be up to the task of defending that offense as they have performed very well thus far , allowing only 3.8 yards per rushing play and 5.9 yards per pass play .
in this game , the heels are once again up against one of the top teams in the nation and i suspect that they will lose the turnover battle again since florida state has not committed a turnover this season .
florida state 's defense has only 4 returning starters but they are once again dominating on that side of the ball , allowing only 1.8 yards per rush and 6.0 yards per pass .
buffalo 's offense is also bad , but connecticut is a horrible defensive team that has allowed 568 total yards per game , including 530 yards to eastern washington .
tulsa blanked a horrible indiana state offense and allowed just 69 total yards in doing so , but their defense is still questionable defending the run and only average in the secondary .
the veteran hurricane secondary is a positive match - up for them here against a fresno offense that gets 67 % of their yards through the air , but my ratings still forecast 31 points for the dogs in this game .
fresno has yielded just 2.3 ypr this season and shut down heisman candidate ken simonton in their win over oregon state .
in 3 games against average overall opposition ( fresno state , colorado state and san jose state ) , the buffs are averaging 215 rushing yards at 4.6 ypr , 246 pass yards at 7.3 ypp and are allowing just 295 total yards per game at 3.5 ypr and 4.8 ypp .
colorado should have an easy time scoring against a jayhawks ' defense that allowed ucla to run for 285 yards at 4.8 ypr and thrown for 183 yards at 9.6 ypp .
kansas is worse than average running the ball and throwing it while colorado is solid against the run and among the best in the nation at defending the pass .
while smu would have lost both games without the offense allowing those touchdowns , they are not as bad as perceived and should only be an 11 ? point underdog in this game based on my ratings .
however , i think nc state 's offense is overrated as they averaged just 3.3 yards per rush and 7.1 yards per pass last season against a schedule of teams that combined to allow an average of 3.9 ypr and 7.5 ypp on defense .
the key to covering the spread in this game is for smu to score a couple of times against an nc state defense that is good defending both the run and the pass .

davis ' criticism of texas misdirected , report finds lynda gledhill , mark martin , chronicle staff writers tuesday , july 10 , 2001 , 2001 san francisco chronicle url : n48875.dtl sacramento -- texas - based electricity generators have received the brunt of criticism from gov. gray davis for gouging california during the power crisis , but financial information released yesterday shows the lion 's share of the money went elsewhere .
companies with headquarters in texas garnered less than 10 percent of california 's multibillion - dollar energy purchases , while public and private energy companies from canada to georgia to california got the rest .

even if energy prices are being manipulated , it may not be illegal david lazarus , chronicle staff writer state --
even if he does prove that electricity generators are ` ` gaming ' ' the market with a variety of price - influencing techniques , it 's a whole other matter as to whether their actions violate the law .
among other things , power generators are said to be rigging electricity auctions and holding back juice until higher demand drives up wholesale prices , representing perhaps the single most glaring example of gaming , or price - fixing , the market .
` ` this has literally been a conspiracy of incompetence , ' ' said michael shames , executive director of the utility consumers ' action network , a san diego grass- roots organization .
` ` almost every player has made major mistakes or a series of mistakes . ' '
officials at the california power exchange , the wholesale market where power companies sell their juice and utilities go shopping , insist that they closely monitor all transactions .
the question is : are power companies benefiting from what are , for them , lucky circumstances , or are they making a bad situation even worse with practices that may not be illegal but still could be viewed as highly irresponsible ?
' even so , power exchange officials said they will tell legislators today that their own study of wholesale electricity prices shows that california rates in june and july were in fact lower than in other states .
instead , the utility exposed its customers to daily price spikes , which resulted in power bills surging skyward .

but charging seven , eight , nine times the price you pay for electricity is simply unconscionable .

the el paso pipeline is one of only two main links feeding energy from the southwest 's natural gas storage pools into california , and state officials contend the houston - based energy company was trying to manipulate the price of gas in the state when it bought up capacity in an auction early last year .
at their highest , in december , the price of gas in southern california spiked to $ 60 per million british thermal units , six times the cost of gas at the other end of the pipeline in texas .
the u.s. federal energy regulatory commission wednesday rejected a complaint from the california public utilities commission alleging that el paso natural gas skewed the bidding process for critical natural gas pipeline capacity into california .
california entities have failed to bid realistically to renew capacity in auctions over the past three - and - a - half years , barone said , even when cost of that capacity was substantially below the rates allowed by regulations .

for natural gas bulls , there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at general electric corp. backlogs in ge 's power systems group almost tripled to $ 25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation 's growing appetite for electricity .
those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution - spewing coal units , which still supply half the nation 's electricity .
( nyse : cpn - news - people ) and other independent power producers , ( see table , below ) will burn a lot of gas , they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much .
combined - cycle gas turbines , which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one , can transform 6,800 btu of gas into a kilowatt - hour of electricity , enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours .
dynegy 's 35-year - old coal plants are " huge capital hogs , " bergstrom says , that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units .
throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls , and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down , bergstrom says .

-- president bush named curt hebert , who has argued against federal involvement in the california electricity crisis , as chairman of the agency that regulates wholesale power markets .
hebert , the former state utility regulator in mississippi , is the only republican on the current five - member federal energy regulatory commission , which he will head .
california gov. gray davis and the state 's cash - strapped utilities have urged ferc to intervene in the wholesale market , arguing that power generating companies were price gouging .
hebert was described by power industry officials as a free - market advocate when it comes to the electricity industry and has favored leaving decisions on electricity deregulation to states instead of the federal government .
hebert , 38 , a former mississippi state legislator and member of the state public service commission , joined ferc in november , 1997 .
it was ferc that issued rules that opened the nation 's electric power grid to competition in the mid-1990s , prompting many states - led by efforts in california - to embrace electricity industry deregulation amid promises it would lead to lower consumer prices because of competition .
enron corp. ( ene ) , here 's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company 's stock .

in this order , the commission addressed five complaints against the calpx concerning its response to alleged defaults by pacific gas & electric ( pg&e ) and southern california edison company ( socal edison ) .
among other things , the commission determined that " the chargeback provision in the px tariff was not designed to address default of this magnitude and , thus , its application in these circumstances is unjust and unreasonable .
regarding the ultimate question of how the px should account for the nonpayments by socal edison and pg&e , the commission deferred further action pending the outcome of socal edison 's state court complaint , as well as the government claims board complaint .
finally , with respect to the px 's bankruptcy proceeding , the commission concluded that section 362(b)(4 ) of the bankruptcy code allowed it to lawfully exercise its regulatory power under sections 205 and 206 of the federal power act , so long as it did not threaten the bankruptcy court 's control over the property of the bankruptcy estate .
" in this order , the commission dismissed the calpx 's request for rehearing of the commission 's january 29 , 2001 order , which found that the calpx had violated the commission 's december 15 , 2000 order and the federal power act .
" pursuant to section 7(c ) of the natural gas act , the commission denied the protests that had been filed and issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity to kern river authorizing it to construct and operate its california action project , subject to resolution of the proceeding pending in docket no .

his creative approach struck a chord ; judge smith put his hands in front of his face in order not to laugh so obviously , but laugh he did .
my sense at the conclusion of the arguments was that the judge had not read much of the defendants ' briefs , but that messrs. rebein and griffin had made compelling arguments in line with those in the briefs , whereas sharp 's arguments remained muddled .
he will issue some form of order or statement - he said by this friday - which identifies those questions which go too far - are outside what he contemplated in the case management order as " limited " personal jurisdiction discovery , versus those questions he thinks defendants should answer because they bear on personal jurisdiction .
jim eisenbrandt and jim flaherty argued persuasively that plaintiffs should have to respond to the personal jurisdiction discovery they had submitted , even if the answers are that the plaintiffs do n't have evidence to support jurisdiction over individual defendants .
he rejected sharp 's argument that it is not " fair " for plaintiffs to have to respond when the defendants have asserted objections .

ngi 's daily gas price index published : october 29 , 2001 alj clears transwestern of market power charges
a ferc administrative law judge has found no improprieties , nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between transwestern pipeline and two shippers on its system , which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $ 27/mmbtu last february , far in excess of the pipeline 's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents / mmbtu ( rp97 - 288 - 009 ) .

n140239.dtl the university of california and the california state university system are accusing energy giant enron of breaking contracts to provide low - cost electricity to state campuses so the company can sell the power at higher prices on the spot market .
in a civil complaint filed friday in federal court in oakland , the universities contend that enron wants to be free to take advantage of soaring market prices for electricity by reselling low - cost power it controls under contracts originally meant to serve the college campuses .
enron spokeswoman peggy mahoney denied the accusation .
mahoney said enron is being forced to release all its direct access customers because the debt - laden utilities have stopped paying enron and other providers a required rebate .

the state lockyer fires earthy attack at energy exec jenifer
lockyer , who is investigating whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale electricity market , made the comment in an interview with the wall street journal that appeared tuesday .
lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says , ' hi my name is spike , honey , ' "
but other industry representatives denounced the remark as " outrageous , " especially because neither lockyer 's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges against enron or other companies .
you 'd expect that the state 's chief legal counsel would file charges first and make public statements second , " said gary ackerman of the western power trading forum , an association of energy producers and traders .
in an interview tuesday , lockyer said he decided to " ratchet up " the commentary to " put [ energy companies ] on notice " that " we are not afraid of them and have the will to prosecute .
several panels , including a state senate committee and the california public utilities commission , are conducting similar probes .
evidence is accumulating that certainly infers illegal activity , " lockyer said .

they also ask that the puc 's education campaign better inform consumers of their rights .

the groups reviewed the " your rights " documents being given to consumers by following companies : entergy solutions , first choice power , green mountain energy co. , the newpower co. , shell energy and txu energy services .
the statement comes two days after the company issued a preliminary notice to the maharashtra state electricity board , a state - run utility , that it would stop supplying electricity if the government company continued to default on payments .
electricity board officials said overdue december and january bills of $ 48 million should be offset against a fine of $ 85.31 million it imposed on enron for not supplying power during the period .
madhav godbole , chairman of the panel of state and federal government officials and officers of a state power utility , resigned to protest a statement by a top politician that implied the panel had a " negative " attitude .
sharad pawar , leader of the nationalist congress party that runs the maharashtra state coalition government , told reporters late tuesday that he did not foresee a positive resolution since the panel was headed by a person with " negative attitudes .
pawar , who did not name godbole , later said his statement had been misinterpreted .
representatives of dabhol power co. , enron 's indian unit , were scheduled to meet the state - government appointed panel three days after the company issued a notice to stop supplying electricity if the maharashtra state electricity board continued to default on payments .
" while enron has demanded that the power utility , the maharashtra state electricity board , make electricity payments on time , the board denies it is a defaulter .
the board has asked that overdue december and january bills of dlrs 48 million be offset against a fine of 4 billion rupees ( dlrs 85.31 million ) it slapped on enron for not supplying power during the same period .

chhagan bhujbal , deputy chief minister of the maharashtra government , and a member of the nationalist congress party , said his party supports godbole .
about ten days ago , three other members of the committee led by godbole , including deepak parekh , chairman of housing development finance corp. , india 's biggest home mortgage lender , quit citing personal reasons .
the committee was set up by maharashtra after dabhol in april authorized its managing director wade cline to cancel the power supply contract .
after months of wrangling over a payments dispute with the cash - strapped state electricity board , the enron unit that runs the project , dabhol power co , last saturday issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power to the utility .

an independent audit finds the utility 's return was double the 15 % the agency said it made selling power during the crisis .
by doug smith and rich connell and robert j. lopez , times staff writers
the document , obtained by the times under the california public records act , seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes .
for months , dwp officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just 15 % above its costs .
as recently as july , former dwp chief s. david freeman , who now heads davis ' new statewide power authority , repeated that assurance in a letter to u.s. senators probing the energy meltdown .
these overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators .
he insisted that he had issued " standing orders " to sell power at a profit of no more than 15 % .
it was not price gouging , " said freeman , who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year .
we charged just and reasonable rates , " he said , adding that the dwp now offers the state electricity with no profit margin .
wiggs ordered the audit in may as questions intensified about the role of the dwp and other public power agencies in driving up the price of wholesale electricity during periods of scarcity .
sen. fred thompson of tennessee , the ranking republican on the governmental affairs committee , which is investigating the crisis , was one of those recently assured by freeman in writing that dwp 's profits were limited to 15 % .
freeman repeatedly said the utility 's prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly , inefficient plants .
former los angeles mayor richard riordan , a possible republican challenger to davis , last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by the dwp during his city hall tenure .
he said the mayor repeatedly questioned the agency 's pricing strategy .
yet another report -- this one by the state 's power - buying agency -- found that the dwp and some other public utilities charged higher than average prices during the first quarter of this year .
although davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on texas - based energy suppliers , republican lawmakers in sacramento and washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of government - owned utilities .
in a letter to a senate investigating committee last month , he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the dwp and others are " merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of in - state public utility agencies .
the state law that authorized the department of water resources to buy power exempted the purchases from puc reviews designed to protect consumers from unreasonable charges .
people ought to be laying down their arms over their energy agendas and asking the question :
another measure would suspend the right of businesses and other electricity customers to stop buying electricity from their local utility and choose their own power provider .
the company has reacted angrily to a draft puc decision to shift $ 600 million of the state 's cost of buying power from edison to pg&e , saying the plan was illegal and discriminates against pg&e customers .
wind and hot water , sunshine and rotting garbage .
ignoring hydroelectric power is shortsighted , and i think not considering nuclear options within the state , at least giving it some public hearing , is shortsighted , " said karal cottrell , a sacramento municipal utility district director .
that 's actually just one of the enemies .
as davis and burton spar , big capitol agenda remains unsettled ( published sept. 10 , 2001 )
the first half of the year was utterly dominated by the energy situation and then by a partisan conflict over the state budget as california 's economy softened and revenues dipped sharply .
burton has denounced the edison bill as a raid on ratepayers while davis has in the past vetoed similar workers ' compensation measures , and is being urged to do it again by employers , who list it at the top of their " job killer " bills .
they represent , in effect , the two faces of the democratic party -- davis the cool , business - friendly centrist and burton the passionate , labor - oriented liberal -- and their personal relationship is practically nil .
greg fishman , an iso spokesman , said " there are times , this does n't happen much , when because of varying ramp rates , we take a bid out of sequence , meaning when one plant has a bid of let 's say $ 50 a megawatt - hour
the iso shall dispatch generating units ... to meet its imbalance energy requirements based on order of energy bid prices , " reads a section of the rules approved by the federal energy regulatory commission .
moreover , the iso has failed to disclose on its web site the price of the dwr power , which is also required under federal regulations .
jan smutny - jones , executive director of the independent energy producers association , a trade group representing large and small power producers , said there is " absolutely no transparency in the iso market .
in fact , power companies in california even sold excess energy to neighboring states .
while customers are n't clamoring for power protection now as they were when the california outages were at the top of the news , there 's still money to be made , says joe wolf , president of compusystems , a washington , mo.-based solution provider .
meanwhile , municipal utility sellers , technically not subject to ferc regulatory jurisdiction under the federal power act , are challenging the commission 's assertion of authority to order them to make refunds .
the vast majority of those involved in the market are due refunds , but only a minority are seeking refunds , " said one attorney in the case , among a handful contacted by dow jones newswires who spoke freely on condition they not be identified .
during the peak of the state 's power crisis , the los angeles department of water and power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials previously acknowledged , it was reported monday .
at the same time , though , the dwp and other publicly owned utilities charged some of the highest prices during the crisis , official reports later showed .
in an interview with the times last week , former dwp chief s. david freeman , who now heads davis ' new statewide power authority , insisted that he had issued " standing orders " to sell power at a profit of no more than 15 percent .
wiggs said that his staff had found no documentation as of friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy during freeman 's tenure , but he said that even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated , it was not excessive .
we charged just and reasonable rates , " wiggs told the times , adding that the dwp now offers the state electricity with no profit margin .
taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair , " said harry snyder , senior advocate for consumers union , the nonprofit that publishes consumer reports .
all we are doing is making sure pacificorp has sufficient power to meet its regulatory obligations , " chief executive ian russell said monday .
the difficult thing is that when we bought that power to meet regulatory supply obligations , we were buying at a price that is over ten times what it is today .
merchant power companies in california , such as dynegy inc. ( dyn ) and mirant corp. ( mir ) continue to sell to the iso , as ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission .
once electricity is deregulated , the price of a kilowatt of energy will change by the minute , with prices posted on the internet every hour .
so , for instance , if the price per kilowatt hour hits rock bottom at 4:36 a.m. , these well - equipped folk wo n't have to wait until the top of the hour to shove the laundry into the washing machine , turn on the dishwasher and get out the vacuum cleaner .
in alberta , prices rose to five times previous levels last winter ; in california , power costs surged at times to levels 5,000 % above normal .
michael trebilcock , a university of toronto law professor and long - time pusher of electricity deregulation , points to deregulation in australia and the u.k. , where , he says , electricity prices fell by 10 % to 15 % .
grant poses the question : " if consumers sign up to a retailer 's fixed price offer and sign away their right to [ a possible ] rebate , do they know what they have given up ?
tangible assets for the public , once central to the deal , have been stripped from it .
it received billions more as part of the above - market consumer rates locked in by the deregulation deal -- until companies that bought the power plants edison cleverly sold them turned the screws last year .
this appears to be an unsubstantiated and illegal cost shift to northern california customers , " lawmakers wrote in a letter sent wednesday to puc president loretta lynch .
meanwhile , pg&e took out radio spots and ads in three newspapers wednesday , urging customers to complain to the puc about the plan .
davis ' optimism contrasted with angry words from consumer activists , who oppose the bill as a bailout of edison .
both bills would bar edison from using the money to repay large energy companies , which democratic legislators accuse of gouging the state during the crisis .
in both plans , edison would also agree not to pursue a series of lawsuits and legal claims against the state .
pacific gas & electric , the state 's largest utility , has filed suit against the state , charging that the rate freeze illegally prohibited the company from recovering its costs of providing power to customers .

sunday , march 25 , 2001 , 2001 san francisco chronicle url : n30195.dtl gov. gray davis , faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers ' electricity bills , is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve , the chronicle has learned .
the irony of the davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies .
this is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking : while consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts , they are n't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way .
simply put , he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power , and thus alleviate shortages , unless there is a financial incentive to do so .
no secret deals , " said harvey rosenfield , head of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica .

three san diego county water districts filed a class - action lawsuit tuesday against 13 power companies , charging they conspired to create an " artificial " power shortage to drive up the cost of electricity .
" there have been three independent investigations that have found no collusion or inappropriate market behavior by generators , " williams said .
in fact , last - minute agreements by the california department of water resources to shut down its pumping stations helped avert " rolling blackouts " across the state when california declared the first two stage 3 power alerts in its history dec. 7 and friday .
arant was diplomatic when asked if he felt the power companies " made up " the power crisis plaguing california .
in that event , the share of the 1000 mw of power turned down by the iou taking all financial benefits is reallocated to the other ious in the same jurisdiction and the companies receiving the power pay the lb crac for that power .

while abraham does not have direct authority over the issue , he is part of an energy policy team appointed by bush .

lay resigned as chairman and chief executive wednesday , saying the multitude of lawsuits and investigations into enron 's spectacular collapse in an accounting scandal is preventing him from properly running the company .
enron reached no . 7 on the fortune 500 and earned hundreds millions in reported profits while concocting financial partnerships that allowed the company to keep half a billion dollars in debt off its books .
he took care of employees , and his community activism pushed her to get involved as well , said calvin , 30 , of houston .
lay was not a mysterious figure nor did he ride in his own private elevator , recalled former accounting specialist sue nix , yet he was hardly someone you bumped into in the cafeteria .
several of those interviewed said their perceptions of lay have shifted , albeit not very dramatically .
they believe other executives and senior managers are responsible , too , such as former ceo jeffrey skilling and former chief financial officer andy fastow .
it was run by lou pai , who sold $ 353 million in enron stock in the past three years , more than any other enron executive , and thomas white , who left enron to become secretary of the army last june .
it activated a toll - free hot line to take calls from laid - off enron employees , which directs them to nearby one - stop employment centers .

in 1986 , kenneth lay was appointed chief executive officer of houston - based enron , the result of a merger between two steady but unspectacular pipeline companies , houston natural gas and internorth .
enron became one of the united states ' largest political donors , lavishing $ 1.7-million during the 2000 elections alone ( 75 % of that went to republicans ) .
mr. lay made it into the inner circles of power -- to the point of being called " kenny - boy " by the nickname - loving commander - in - chief and becoming the only energy executive allowed to meet dick cheney , the u.s. vice - president , when he was crafting the administration 's energy policy last year .
the only problem was it was n't making nearly enough money to justify its valuation and was being swamped by debt .
the departure in august of jeff skilling , enron 's president and chief executive officer , for personal reasons signalled that something was very wrong .
and all that money that kenny - boy lavished on the white house ?
his reward was a frosty mention from mr. bush calling him " mr. lay , " then lamenting the $ 8,000 his mother - in - law lost by holding enron shares .
during these conference calls in september or early october , duncan , the lead auditor , tells committee investigators that andersen attorney nancy temple asks : " how are you on compliance with the document - retention policy on enron ? "
oct. 25 , enron issues a notice advising that preservation of documents is required by law , given that the company was being sued by investors .
duncan later tells committee investigators that he complied with temple 's instructions in a nov. 9 voice mail and stopped document destruction , which duncan said he had undertaken in compliance with the firm 's policy on retention and destruction of documents .
lay is scheduled to testify feb. 4 before two congressional panels , the house financial services committee and the senate commerce committee .
duncan invokes his fifth amendment right against self - incrimination .
at what 's behind the enron corp. collapse left lawmakers thursday certain of only one thing : thousands of documents were destroyed by the energy company 's blue - ribbon accounting firm .

sir , on the advice of my counsel and by the constitution of the united states i 'm not going to answer that question .
he promised " a lively narrative " about the houston - based energy corporation that collapsed amid allegations of shady accounting and executive greed .
enron typically gave about 1 percent of its pretax earnings to various causes under the leadership of kenneth lay , who resigned wednesday as chairman and chief executive .
when enron filed for bankruptcy , the club was left penniless and nearly had to shut down .
the name of the game was greed and they used the savings of trusting people , employees and investors , to stake their play .
many paid monthly gas bills that equaled their mortgage payments , and enron earned huge profits on the backs of those who used gas to keep from freezing .

the drug war on trial " -- independent policy forum transcript now
available national security crisis likely to feed government growth military and economic crises have been the twin engines propelling the growth of american government , as politicians have rushed through new spending programs and regulations to show the public that they were " doing something .
this " ratchet effect " is of special concern in the aftermath of the sept. 11th attacks , as congress gave the executive branch broad powers intended to fight terrorism and prop up a faltering economy , according to higgs in an interview with reason magazine .
critical episodes in the growth of american government , by robert higgs , see how the feds misrepresented anti - privacy provisions of 1994
law congress is now contemplating passage of the mobilization against terrorism act , which would ( among other things ) expand government wiretapping and eavesdropping powers .
yet when testifying to congress about the proposed calea , the fbi 's then - director louis freeh repeatedly claimed that calea would confer no new authority on law enforcement officials , provide no information about the physical location of cellular phone calls , and not weaken existing privacy protections .
the calea episode , argues twight , demonstrates that congress is no match for crafty machinations of bureaucrats expert in masking their true intentions by hamstringing congress 's ability to understand the meaning of new legislation -- what twight calls an example of the manipulation of " political transaction costs , " such as the cost of understanding the details of legislation .
the confluence of calea , federally mandated electronic databases of personal information , carnivore , digital storm , echelon , and the like have established a web of federal surveillance never before known in the united states , " writes twight .
one way or another , we will soon learn that the resistance - inhibiting power of broad - based government surveillance is potentially the most liberty - endangering form of political transaction - cost manipulation confronting americans -- and freedom - loving people everywhere -- in the new millennium .

now available many public officials fear political reprisals if they speak out against the " war on drugs , " but judges james gray ( orange county , calif. , superior court ) and vaughn walker
( u. s. district court , san francisco , calif. ) , not only testified against it at the recent independent policy forum , " the drug war on trial :
judge gray began by explaining how his years as a criminal prosecutor led him to write his recent book , why our drug laws have failed
despite the vast sums poured into drug interdiction and prosecution , judge gray explained , he observes that drugs are no harder to obtain today than when he was prosecuting drug cases .
further , drugs today are often more dangerous because anti - smuggling efforts and anti - marijuana laws have led drug dealers to supply drug users with more potent drugs .
but , he said , the judges can not be the sole advocates of sensible drug - law reform -- citizens in every walk of life must become better informed about the drug war 's tremendous economic , social and health costs , and voice their objections in public .

los angeles times , 11/01/00 usa : us ferc probe finds no calif. market abuse by utilities .
- the federal energy regulatory commission on wednesday said in a report that california utilities were not necessarily to blame for last summer 's price rises , which led to an unravelling of the state 's move to deregulate retail power markets .
at the same time , utilities elsewhere in the state hemorrhaged hundreds of millions of dollars due to a state - mandated rate freeze that required them to sell power at below cost .
during public hearings in san diego in september , ferc chairman james j. hoecker promised that the commission would take action and " do whatever it takes " to repair california 's electricity market , whose deregulation was set in motion by landmark state legislation in september 1996 .
but an indictment of power generation companies -- which some in the state accuse of " gaming , " or manipulating the system to wield unfair " market power " and wringing excessive profits from customers -- is unlikely , according to published reports and state industry principals and government officials .
the ferc commissioners are said to blame market deficiencies and defects in california for a supply - demand imbalance that sent wholesale electricity prices skyrocketing in july to an average of 12.9 cents a kilowatt - hour , more than triple the july 1999 average of 3.9 cents .
the davis administration has gone on record demanding that ferc , which oversees the transmission and wholesale selling of electricity around the country , to step in and discharge its legal duty to restore " just and fair " electricity rates in california .
i have no idea what the ferc will say , " said state public utilities commission president loretta lynch , a davis appointee who says she is as much in suspense as anyone .
consumer advocates and the state 's major utilities would like to see ferc impose some sort of wholesale price controls -- even gut the power exchange and the independent system operator because they are clearly not working as intended .
some consumer groups would like to see ferc declare the wholesale rates collected by generators " unjust and unreasonable , " legal code words that would open the gates to actions by the puc or the legislature to force the power companies to disgorge or refund excessive profit .
duke and others also strenuously oppose a solution proposed by the state 's municipal utilities , notably the los angeles department of water and power : that the industry in essence be re - regulated by imposing a system of cost - based rate controls , similar to how electricity rates were set before deregulation .
such a move would lead to lawsuits filed by duke and other power merchants alleging " confiscatory " actions by the state nullifying the value of hundreds of millions of dollars they have invested in california power plants .
los angeles dwp general manager s. david freeman , who has led calls for temporary imposition of cost - based rates , said california 's failed deregulation experiment raises the possibility that electricity is intrinsically an " un - deregulatable " service .
they are industry gatherings that make little or no pretense of focusing on public policy .

9:50pm houston chronicle arena flier rouses ire of backers letter attacks plan , mayor and democrats by eric berger
houston chronicle arena proponents are decrying a letter circulating among area republicans that ties the proposal to houston mayor lee brown and contains at least six factual errors .
there are three areas where we believe mayor lee brown 's multimillion - dollar corporate welfare campaign must be addressed , " states the letter , which was mailed to more than 500 republicans and was sponsored by republican precinct chairwoman mary jane smith .
what it fails to mention is that conservative u.s. rep. bill archer , r - houston , has endorsed the plan and that the pro - arena campaign chairmen are notable republican fund - raisers ken lay and don jordan .
beyond brown , the letter also seeks to tie the pro - arena campaign to vice president al gore , the democratic presidential candidate .
such questionable associations -- lay , for example , is one of republican presidential candidate gov. george w. bush 's closest business advisers -- offer a vivid look at how desperate arena opponents are , walden contends .
all of my republican buddies are opposed to this , " she said .
people are taking the attitude of ` how dare anyone question us ? '
the ballot language does not rule out ... the usual cost overruns .
this is irrelevant because the houston rockets pay construction cost overruns . ?
earlier this year , the company was required to separate all or most of its power plants and assets from its transmission lines and related assets in those states as part of efforts to open the ohio and texas markets to competition .

governor , utility in war of words davis furious as pg&e defends bankruptcy filing david lazarus , chronicle staff writer
monday , april 9 , 2001 , 2001 san francisco chronicle url : n223519.dtl california 's energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as gov. gray davis and pacific gas and electric co. traded barbs over who is to blame for the bankruptcy of the state 's largest utility .
in a series of tit - for - tat statements , each side laid claim to the moral high ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith .
the governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews in response to the chronicle 's report saturday that pg&e awarded $ 50 million in bonuses and raises to 6,000 employees just hours before friday 's bankruptcy filing .
in a testy reply , pg&e countered that " instead of focusing all his attention on solving the state 's yearlong and ever - worsening energy crisis , the governor has launched a campaign - style attack on our company .
steve maviglio , a spokesman for the governor , fired back yesterday : " pg&e waged a public relations war on friday .
much changed nevertheless , while pg&e 's bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect of california 's long - drawn - out energy mess , at the end of the day , it does n't really change a thing .
consider : -- pg&e 's financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs .
california consumers still face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer .
the crux of the problem is still the same , " said loretta lynch , president of the state public utilities commission .
nettie hoge , executive director of the utility reform network in san francisco , said all this finger - pointing will do nothing to ensure that californians have ample supplies of electricity this summer .
they 're all on the firing line right now , " he noted , adding that " i would be doing exactly the same thing if i were them . "
then what happens if they go ahead on the basis of an incomplete picture ? "
this is just ferc trying to show they 're doing something , trying to cover their ass .
i toned down references to the secretary 's action yesterday , reduced the discussion of caps , and eliminated our response to the " when did you stop beating your dog " question .

this is extraordinary , " said doug heller , consumer advocate with the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica .
if that price were sustained for a month and consumers were no longer protected by the current rate freeze , the average monthly residential bill would jump to $ 620 , heller said .
the so - called soft price cap , which requires power generators to detail the costs behind the price bid , is like one proposed by the federal energy regulatory commission , said kellan fluckiger , chief operating officer for the california independent system operator , which balances electricity supply and demand on the power grid serving 75 % of the state .
electricity demand in california peaked at slightly more than 33,000 megawatts tuesday ; about 8,500 megawatts of in - state power remained unavailable because power plants were undergoing maintenance .
electricity reserves fell to less than 5 % late in the day when some power facilities in utah suddenly tripped offline , cutting imports from the southwest by 1,200 megawatts .
customers of the los angeles department of water and power are unaffected by the power emergencies .
the facility must still meet all requirements of the federal clean air act as well as state air - pollution controls .

amendments taken in the assembly appropriations committee on july 19 delete references to petroleum products , coal and coal products , and limit the bill to apply to electricity and natural gas .
according to a public opinion poll recently released by the public policy institute of california , residents by a two - to - one margin ( 65 % ) say questions of how to address the electricity crisis should be decided , not by the legislature and governor , but by voters through state ballot initiatives in 2002 .
following the repeal of the federal occupational safety and health act ( osha ) ergonomic rule by congress , secretary of labor , elaine chao promised that public forums would be held in several locations to explore the issue of developing an ergonomic standard .
the forum follows a major victory for california employers when on july 19 the california occupational safety and health standards board unanimously rejected a petition from organized labor to adopt the overturned federal occupational safety and health act ( osha ) ergonomic rule .
panels began with organized labor representatives who criticized the repeal of the ergonomic rule and urged the secretary to quickly adopt new rules to protect workers .
the second panel was made up largely of educators and scientists who have studied the ergonomics issue extensively and believe that the science does not justify an ergonomic standard such as the federal osha rule .
the bill contains language that invites multiple lawsuits for the same alleged violation , even in the face of a court - approved settlement .

the commission has recently stepped up its scrutiny of power companies ' behavior during california 's power crisis , asking suppliers to justify $ 124 million in sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money .
critics claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being challenged .
both utilities , the state 's largest , have been cut off by electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless .
a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction wednesday ordering a major electricity wholesaler , reliant energy services , to continue selling to california despite its fear that it will not be paid .
u.s. district judge frank c. damrell jr. said californians were at risk of irreparable harm if reliant stopped selling power to the iso , which buys it at the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend off rolling blackouts .
on wednesday , cooling temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed the state to avoid blackouts .

we recognize the commission 's efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the california and western markets , including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices .
if the commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan , it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law .
in states where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs , consumers have less incentive to conserve .

on oct. 16 , enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years , taking a $ 1.2 billion charge against shareholder equity relating to dealing with partnerships run by then enron chief financial officer andrew fastow .
the ranking democrat on the house energy and commerce committee said on monday there was " pretty strong evidence " of insider trading as well as false accounting in the fall of
the energy - trading giant enron corp. rep. john dingell of michigan , whose committee is one of those investigating enron , spoke on cbs television 's " the early show .
there 's pretty strong evidence of insider trading , " at enron , dingell said , adding that there was " clear evidence of failure to file honest and correct annual reports " required by the securities and exchange commission .
some enron shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing a group of 29 enron executives and directors of " unlawful insider trading " and misleading the investing public .
rep. henry waxman , a california democrat , wrote to enron chairman kenneth lay over the weekend to ask him to explain why he sent out optimistic e - mails to enron employees in august about the company 's prospects .
the episode sapped the life savings of many enron employees whose 401(k ) plans were heavily invested in enron stock , while top executives allegedly pocketed fat profits by selling ahead of a dizzying plunge in the share price .
representatives of ubs warburg and enron did n't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment monday .
top of the news at enron , ignorance was bliss dan ackman ,
- what did he know and when did he know it ?
but it will also be asked more pointedly , for now , about enron chairman kenneth lay ; its briefly serving chief executive , jeffrey skilling ; and their top executives .
over the weekend , treasury secretary paul o'neill and commerce secretary donald evans said they had not told the president about calls from lay that alerted them to enron 's impending doom .
i did n't think this was worthy of me running across the street and telling the president , " mr. o'neill told fox news on sunday .
evans said he did nothing to assist lay or enron , but also said lay did not make him aware of the full story .
evans said he was not told any information that had not already been made public .
unlike o'neill , evans said he did inform the white house -- not the president himself but chief of staff andrew card jr. about the call .
he also said he generally discussed enron 's problems with president bush several times in november and december .
they doled out $ 623,000 over the course of his political career , according to another group that favors an overhaul of campaign finance , the center for public integrity .
enron was tight with politicians and with wall street , whose analysts almost universally backed the company even after lay was placing calls to cabinet officers .
dpc has squarely put the blame for the present state of affairs on the default on bill payments by the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) and the refusal by the lenders to use the existing dpc funds or infuse fresh funds .
administration officials have said they took no such action , but that hardly matters at the moment .
outside the narrow confines of wall street , most people do n't know from conflict - ridden off - balance - sheet partnerships or shady accounting practices ... but everyone understands influence - peddling and how wrong it is .
or , to use president bush 's now - well - publicized nickname for enron 's chief executive :
the fact that there 's no credible indication as yet that anyone in the bush administration did anything improper about enron is n't going to slow down the story one bit .
in other words , each company tried every way possible to show that despite the misdeeds of one neighbor , they were were all good corporate citizens .

the cpuc also adopted what pacific gas & electric described as " an illegal and retroactive accounting change that would appear to eliminate our true uncollected wholesale costs .
finally , the company said it recognized " the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with gov. gray davis and his representatives are going nowhere .

in a new twist in the ongoing saga between the dabhol power co. and india 's maharashtra state electricity board , the company monday sent the board a notice of political force majeure to enforce its rights under a 1995 power purchase agreement between the two parties .
essentially , this move is to protect dpc from being penalized by the state electricity board if political uncertainties interrupt its power supply to the board .
critics object to dabhol charging inr7.1 a kilowatt hour for its power versus inr1.5 charged by other suppliers .
- enron power corp sent a political " force majeure " notice to the state - run electricity board of india 's maharashtra state on saturday , officials said .
the move means enron is putting the state and federal governments on notice that it might be unable to discharge its contractual obligations to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) due to domestic political events beyond its control .
this was one of the steps necessary ... to enforce our rights , " dpc spokesman jimmy mogal said .
enron and the state government disagree regarding the cost of electricity from the dabhol plant .
enron and the indian government have been sparring over the past few months over the maharashtra state electricity board 's ( mseb ) repeated default on payments owed to dabhol power company ( dpc ) , which is 65 percent owned by
last week enron notified the government it is applying to an arbitration court in london to consider its claim for 1.02 billion rupees ( $ 21.88 million ) owed by the mseb for power it purchased in december from dabhol power company .

as power prices skyrocket and california reels from the threat of blackouts , the agency charged with overseeing the state 's power grid has come under increasing attack , and federal regulators are poised to order sweeping changes in its governing board .
ever since the legislature created the california independent system operator four years ago , critics have lambasted the agency , saying it is dominated by the power industry and does not have ratepayers ' interests at heart .
there are people on the iso governing board who have a direct financial interest in the policies they set , " said severin borenstein , a professor of business administration and public policy at the university of california at berkeley and the director of the university of california energy institute .
today , the federal energy regulatory commission is expected to issue a ruling that would remake the iso 's 26-member board , which includes representatives of three investor - owned utilities , four municipal utilities and two power generators .
last month , federal regulators proposed an order calling for the iso board to be replaced by seven independent members .
we had a republican assembly and a republican governor ( pete wilson ) with ( his ) appointees on the puc with a free market point of view , " bowen said .
private companies ' leverage doug heller , assistant director of the foundation for consumer and taxpayer rights , said the legislature set up the iso the way it did because " it and the regulators were so transfixed with the idea of the free market that they ignored the tremendous leverage they were handing over to the private energy companies .
they are expected to announce measures today intended to keep wholesale prices stable and thus protect users from sharp increases in their power bills .
the iso is currently chaired by jan smutny - jones , executive director of the independent energy producers association , a trade association whose members generate about 24,000 megawatts of power in california .
the board 's members include representatives from two power generators , dynegy inc. and an affiliate of florida power and light ; the state 's three investor - owned utilities , pg&e , southern california edison and san diego gas and electric ; and four municipal utilities serving los angeles , sacramento , silicon valley and several southern california communities .
power pricing gatekeeper mike florio , an attorney for the utility reform network in san francisco and a member of the iso board , said that although the composition of the iso board is only one element of the california energy crisis , the iso " is at the crux of the matter because it establishes and administers the state market rules that determine how pricing gets done .
for his part , the consumer network 's shames is proposing a merger of the iso and the california power exchange , which coordinates the wholesale market , thereby creating a " superagency " with full powers of oversight and enforcement .
the iso is a flawed institution , but it is not responsible for the shortages , " said shames of the utility consumers ' action network .
but he cautioned that if an iso restructuring is all that happens , " we might as well do nothing .
then we have failed our duty to californians .

obviously a contract containing this kind of clause will not be signed by anyone .
a clause containing this kind of language has been used in the past , but it is not part of the eei or wspp , for example , and one can not say it is widely in effect in our agreements .
the other guy is in exactly the same boat .

coach mack brown is the one who invented early recruiting in texas , and he did it through his june camps .
there 's nothing wrong with that , and i am not knocking their strategy .
texas probably would have offered riley a scholarship at some point if he had not committed to a&m , but the longhorn coaches did not recruit morton as hard as they are recruiting several other offensive linemen in the state .
most of those commitments last june were from big offensive linemen who were just what the longhorns needed .
dt lyle sendlein of scottsdale , arizona , younger brother of current ut lb austin sendlein and son of former ut and pro lb robin sendlein , told me he probably will commit to texas when he attends the longhorns ' early june camp .
he is the top recruit in arizona and is being heavily recruited by top schools all over the country .

by james taranto shattered the secret service agent who was booted from an american airlines flight on christmas day has hired a team of washington lawyers to press his case that he was the victim of " profiling .
as we noted friday , a press release from the council on american islamic relations claimed that the pilot had singled him out
not only because he is arab - american but because he is muslim -- though how anyone was supposed to have known shatter 's religion is a mystery .
presumably the folks at cair are aware that three out of four arab - americans are christian .
* * quote * * * in the report , the pilot said the incident began when a flight attendant said she and other flight attendants were concerned about the actions of a passenger .
while the passenger was away , the flight attendants " observed books in the individuals ( sic ) seat which were written in what she assessed was arabic style print , " the pilot wrote .
shatter , of course , was carrying a gun , which , as a law - enforcement agent , he was entitled to do -- but one can hardly fault the pilot for wanting to be absolutely certain the firearm - toting passenger was who he claimed he was .
airport - security bureaucracy can be maddening , and as a cop , he 's probably not used to having his authority questioned .
but the point is , the airlines have a longstanding record of not messing around when it comes to access to their planes -- no matter what the passenger 's color is .
when american airlines spokeswoman laura mayo says the incident was not about racial profiling but about " confirming that an armed individual is who he says he is and that he is qualified to travel , " we ought to believe her .
* * another times report says the terror group lashkar - i - taiba , which is believed to have perpetrated the parliament attack , has threatened to blow up the taj mahal -- a muslim mausoleum .
and the press trust of india picks up a washington post report that , as pti puts it , " president pervez musharraf has left terrorists in pakistan - occupied kashmir ( pok ) free to continue their activities in jammu and kashmir , confining his mild crackdown to pakistan proper .
musharraf responded that pakistan was prepared for war if it came to that : but he made unmistakably clear that the pakistani militants were enemies of pakistan itself .
he said , " no wicked , bigoted extremist will be allowed to derail us , and we , the vast , silent majority , must vow not to be voiceless , passive onlookers to our own internal destruction .
* * did the caged bird sing ? http://kausfiles.com/ speaking of optimism , here 's mickey kaus 's take on the courtroom defiance of the " 20th hijacker " :
shin bet , israel 's security agency , foiled the plan when it " arrested a hamas operative at the rafah border crossing as he attempted to travel to saudi arabia to organize funding for the project .
the suspect , osama zuhar hamed karika , " told investigators that he was instructed . . . to travel under the pretext of wishing to make a pilgrimage to mecca ; once there , he met with hamas officials and solicited financial backing .
the post also reports that an iranian newspaper is criticizing ex - president hashemi rafsanjani 's threat to destroy israel with nuclear weapons :
on that day , the strategy of the west will hit a dead end , since a single atomic bomb has the power to completely destroy israel , while an israeli counterstrike can only cause partial damage to the islamic world , " he said .
* noruz , a reformist newspaper , criticized rafsanjani and , " saying the ex - president 's statements caused damage to the state 's national interests .
belarus is quietly acting as a leading supplier of lethal military equipment to islamic radicals -- with terrorists and militant organizations in the middle east , balkans and central asia often the recipients , " mark lenzi writes in a washington post op - ed :
* * * while it is deplorable that belarus 's weapons have been responsible for prolonging civil wars and internal strife in countries such as tajikistan , angola and algeria , it is particularly disturbing that sudan , a country where osama bin laden used to live and one that is known as a haven for terrorists , has obtained from belarus such proven and capable weapon systems as t-55 tanks and mi-24 hind helicopter gunships .
given that iraq has repeatedly tried to shoot down u.s. and british aircraft patrolling the u.n. no - fly zone -- with more than 420 attempts this year alone -- covert belarusian - iraqi military cooperation is disturbing and should set off alarm bells in western capitals .
the washington post quotes celinda lake , " a democratic pollster who is an authority on reaching female voters , " as saying the war on terror has drawn strong support from the fairer sex :
* * quote * * * lake . . . said bush 's war message has had the unusual effect of appealing both to " women on the left who are concerned about rights and equity and traditional feminism , and to women on the right who were concerned about the taliban 's treatment of female christian missionaries .

it 's certainly true that , as wral puts it , black americans " been the victims of bombings , lynchings and other acts of terror .

each of them have beaten the stock market ( measured by the s&p 500 index ) over the past five years , while minimizing risk relative to other funds with the same objective .

the report cites numerous flaws in the state 's attempt to deregulate the power market and also raises the possibility that power sellers intentionally withheld supplies to raise prices .
they include a flawed attempt to deregulate california 's power market , a lack of adequate power generation in the state and a spike in the cost of natural gas , which is used to fuel many power plants .
the report said it was " also possible that individual sellers tacitly colluded to withhold supplies in order to push prices above competitive levels , " a charge repeatedly leveled by davis and consumer groups .
tana : since credit has restricted both peoples gas and city of talahassee , these cps are restricted by legal as well .
* * * that problem is the obsession with deregulation that has had such a hold on the republican party and corporate america . . . .
* herbert asserts , though he fails to demonstrate , that deregulation , sought by enron and instituted by republican " zealots , " led to the company 's downfall .
herbert is accusing republicans merely of supporting policies with which he disagrees .
there 's nothing corrupt about that .
enron was not about ideology and certainly not partisanship , but was using governmental contacts to maximize profits .
there 's nothing particularly unusual about a company favoring regulation ; a business enterprise is , by definition , not " about ideology " but about making a profit .
the most amusing part of this story , though , is the final two paragraphs :
* * quote * * * paul krugman , an editorial columnist for the new york times , said he was also paid $ 50,000 to serve on an enron advisory board in 1999 .
this was an advisory panel that had no function that i was aware of , " mr. krugman said today .
* * krugman , who is also an economics professor at a university in or near texas , quit his enron gig when he joined the times .
the university of south florida recently fired sami al - arian , a tenured palestinian arab computer - science professor who has become notorious for anti - israel comments and who has been investigated for , though never charged with , links to terror organizations .
they said they want people to stop calling their school " terrorism university , " " jihad u. " and the " university of suicidal fanatics .
saudi sob stories austrians , as reader s.e. brenner points out , sometimes make the risible and rather offensive claim that they were the nazis ' " first victims .
it quotes saudis who do n't believe that saudi native osama bin laden was behind the attacks and who accuse the u.s. of failing to provide " proof " that 15 of the sept. 11 hijackers were saudi citizens .
and just in case the nazi analogy seems strained , the times also quotes saudis who blame the jews for everything : " ' all saudis like americans , ' said abdelaziz , a businessman who requested that his full name not be used . '
i did not immediately talk to the passengers next to me , nor did i dare ask the flight attendant for a glass of water .
all of a sudden i asked myself why i should have to fear others , and myself , when i am fully certain that i have nothing to do with terrorism , except my terror of terrorism itself .

the los angeles times reports : " the timing of the arrests provoked questions , coming just two days before olson 's sentencing on charges of planting a bomb under a los angeles police car in 1975 .
the paper does n't say who asked the questions the timing " provoked , " nor does it say just what the questions were .

the central and state governments have failed to manage the dabhol crisis effectively , writes john elliott business standard friday , may 18 , 2001 godbole panel not to seek replacements our regional bureau in mumbai the economic times friday , may 18 , 2001 dpc lenders put off preliminary termination notice anto joseph mumbai : the industrial development bank of india has once again prevented enron - promoted 2,144-mega - watt dabhol power company from issuing a preliminary termination notice .
many off - shore lenders of the $ 2.9-billion dpc are still in favour of issuance of a preliminary termination notice to the maharashtra government .
in the board meeting , the company had authorised two persons -- wade cline , managing director of enron india and neil mcgregor , president and ceo of dabhol power company -- to issue the termination notice , whenever lenders agree .
the recent stand - off between the state government - owned power utility and the us power major stemmed from a payment crisis .
mseb had delayed the monthly payments of electricity bills from october last year and subsequently defaulted payments , claiming that the cost of power produced by dpc is exorbitant .
enron india had subsequently invoked state guarantees , counter - guarantees , and political force majeure and then went on to invoke the arbitration clause .
maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has convened a crucial meeting on saturday with state officials , the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the advocate general and legal experts to take stock of the situation of the ongoing dabhol crisis .
in fact , the state energy department and mseb were surprised over the recent statement by the union minister of power suresh prabhu that neither national thermal power corporation nor power trading corportion are in a position to purchase or trade dabhol power to other states .
the centre should benchmark " an affordable " tariff of dabhol power company 's ( dpc ) liquified natural gas ( lng ) based power , so as to enable the central utilities like the national thermal power corporation ( ntpc ) or the power trading corporation ( ptc ) to buy and distribute power from the us energy major , according to a senior official of maharashtra government .
now that dpc is ready for renegotiations , why does the centre not set the terms of tariff for the multinational 's lng - based power ? , " the official said here today reacting to a statement made yesterday by union power minister suresh prabhu that the centre would allow sale of power to a " willing buyer " if dpc and the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) jointly approach with a concrete proposal .
the minister also categorically stated that ntpc could not buy dpc 's power , as it was a mere " power selling entity " .
that is a time limit that had never been demanded before and which the dabhol equipment is not designed to meet .
then the central government used this time - limit issue as an excuse for not paying enron money that was due under the project 's finance ministry counter guarantee .
this must have confirmed enron 's belief that there is really no chance of it ever being allowed to settle down at dabhol to a normal business relationship with the maharashtra government , the state 's political parties , and the state electricity board .
then there were blockages on enron 's plans for broadband telecom and gas sales , followed by the nagpur attacks , and damming statements issued since then by the maharashtra government .
now the story is lost in a complex array of arbitration and conciliation , lenders ' meetings , government meetings , and often contradictory newspaper reports .

* * that , of course , does not reflect badly -- or indeed , in any way at all -- on president bush , though the incident reflects terribly on the bush - league journalism they practice at the nation .
we all make mistakes , but this is only the latest in a string of staggeringly stupid stumbles by nation editors and writers that we 've chronicled in recent months : - katrina vanden heuvel , editor - in - chief of this political magazine , appeared on national television and could not name her own congressman .
-just two weeks after sept. 11 , columnist katha pollitt wrote a piece in which she boasted of her contempt for the american flag .
is it possible that the nation , that venerable left - wing magazine , has been infiltrated by right - wing moles who are acting like idiots in an effort to discredit the left ?
it 's a puff piece on enron , and it stands in sharp contrast with krugman 's current views on the subject , most notably his column of last friday ( times links require registration ) , in which he rails against the company as a symbol of the corruption of american capitalism .
he disclosed his relationship with enron in the fortune piece and again in a january 2001 times column .
this seems an exceedingly picayune point , especially for someone who styles himself the scourge of " gotcha journalism .
in any case , sullivan 's beef here ought to be not with krugman but with his editors at fortune and the times , who surely knew enough to ask about the fee and insist on disclosure if they thought it necessary .
krugman 's own defense is awfully , well , defensive , though at least his self - esteem seems healthy :

rowan williams , the archbishop of wales , is denouncing the war on terrorism as " tainted .
in an essay reprinted in today 's guardian , he suggests that the american campaign in afghanistan is morally equivalent to the attack on the world trade center :
it is just possible to deplore civilian casualties and retain moral credibility when an action is clearly focused and its goals are on the way to evident achievement .
tainted , because as soon as assaults on public morale by allowing random killing as a matter of calculated policy become part of a military strategy , we are at once vulnerable to the charge that there is no moral difference in kind between our military action and the terror that it attacks .

nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing .
certainly too few consumers and policymakers understand the value of renewable energy products - products that avoid the acid rain , smog , global warming , and soot pollution caused by mainly coal - burning power plants .
it 's not surprising that few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still do n't know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage .
consumer inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the rule that people know the price of everything .
even sophisticated observers do n't know the price of comparative products , regardless of the added environmental and public health costs .
price transparency is a bad joke , because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in houston .
perhaps even fewer know how prices alone , not including the stranded cost charges , of today 's competitive products compare to their utilities ' unbundled generation rates charged prior to competition .
but even that 's only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question about electricity : " what is it worth ?
the price for renewable generation must be over 8.0 cents / kwh for the consumer to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and nuclear power .
for hospitals , which must fight the devastating health effects of dirty coal - generated power every day , how much is that worth ?
the price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for dirty power in 1996 or even what many are paying now .

why it pays to be green kyoto wallflowers kevin whitelaw
when president bush dismissed the kyoto climate change treaty as " fatally flawed , " he meant to spare american companies from paying dearly to control pollution .
key republican legislators , despite white house opposition , favor a market - based system that 's not as stringent as kyoto .
bush has injected only turbulence . ' ' for all their wealth , power and influence , though , these companies say they have been cut out of discussions at the white house .
a white house spokeswoman , claire e. buchan , said : ' ' we are taking this issue very seriously .
' in contrast to executives of companies seeking limits on the gases , people representing companies opposed to restrictions , including exxon mobil and many coal companies , said they thought that their message was resonating .
fredrick d. palmer , executive vice president for legal and external affairs at peabody energy of st. louis , one of the world 's largest coal producers , said it was not really necessary to lobby the bush administration on the issue , because big coal 's interests and the administration 's views were in sync from the start . '
the one thing so far that unifies the energy industry is its opposition to the jeffords emissions bill in its current form , mainly because it stipulates that old power plants install the latest technology to clean up emissions within five years .
one of the staunchest foes of limits on carbon dioxide is the southern company of atlanta , whose nuclear and coal - fired plants span georgia , florida , alabama and mississippi , and whose donations to the republican party last year were second only to enron 's .
mr. barbour mainly works to loosen enforcement of environmental regulations affecting utilities , though other washington lobbyists said that he had also argued against action on reducing carbon dioxide emissions .

they include san jose - based generator calpine corp. and houston power trader enron corp. maviglio was repeatedly questioned about the ethics of his holdings tuesday during his traditional weekly media briefing with reporters , and remained defiant , insisting he had done nothing improper .
spokeswoman hilary mclean initially took questions from the two dozen print , radio and television reporters in attendance , but maviglio , who was standing beside the podium , eventually came to his own defense .
maviglio reiterated his stance that he was not privileged with any inside information unavailable to the public when he placed his order for calpine stock on may 31 .
he said he would be willing to divest the stock if davis asks him to , but maintained his belief that the transaction did not violate any laws .
reporters sharply questioned maviglio 's insistence that he was not privy to more information on the state 's electricity purchases than the general public .
maviglio blamed the press for making his stock an issue .
this trades bandwidth in much the same way as other enron units trade gas and electricity - except that broadband is losing money .

embattled rep. condit continues fund - raising , campaign spending by don thompson associated press writer 07/31/2001
u.s. rep. gary condit continued raising and spending campaign money this spring at about his usual pace , despite the media and police frenzy over his romantic ties to a missing washington , d.c. , intern .
condit , whose congressional financial disclosure forms show little personal wealth , has hired a high - profile washington lawyer to represent him during the levy matter .
that has led some to speculate whether he would pay his legal bills from his campaign funds , but this report shows no payments to either attorney abbe lowell or
public relations specialist marina ein , who now represent condit .
jones)- california gov. gray davis " absolutely ( does ) not " intend to fire his senior press secretary because he bought stock in calpine corp ( cpn ) in june , davis ' senior political advisor garry south said tuesday .
the press secretary , steve maviglio , revealed monday that he bought 300 shares of calpine stock on june 20 , 2001 .
california secretary of state bill jones , who is running for governor against davis , renewed calls tuesday for maviglio 's dismissal at a press conference in los angeles .
he also said he will not resign and will only sell his energy stocks if told to do so by his attorney or the governor .
if that were the case , every person in state government would have to divest every stock they have before they made a public statement .
nichols will likely have to sell his shares in enron , which never signed power deals with the state , but the dwr has allowed him to keep his shares in general electric , dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said .

a major hang - up in california was its half - measure deregulation of the wholesale market , which led to massive price spikes because utilities were prevented from buying forward contracts to protect against volatile prices swings .
for whatever reason , texas customers did not exactly flock to join the pilot program , which ends when full deregulation begins on jan. 1 , 2002 .
texans can now choose their electric company the same way they choose other goods and services in their everyday lives , " said texas public utilities commission chairman max yzaguirre , the former head of enron corp. 's ene.n mexican division .
half a dozen pacific northwest utilities are seeking nearly $ 700 million in reimbursements from energy suppliers they accuse of price gouging , but some of the accused gougers are actually other utilities from the region .
papers submitted to the commission detail the allegations , and point fingers at national power producers such as enron , dynegy and duke energy .
the legal standard , first , is that rates have to be just and reasonable , " phillip chabot , tacoma power 's attorney , told a group of northwest public radio stations on monday .

enron chief takes back key positions energy lay vows that nothing
financial times ; aug 16 , 2001 enron ceo 's departure not passing the smell test thestreet.com , 08/15/01 companies & finance the americas : skilling 's abrupt departure mystifies energy sector : the resignation of the enron chief executive after six months will not alter the company 's strategy , writes sheila mcnulty :
after six months as chief executive , mr skilling abruptly resigned on tuesday evening , shocking financial markets , the analysts who had tracked his 11-year rise to the top - even the man who hired him .
mr skilling simply cited " personal reasons " in his farewell conference with analysts .
and there were those who accused him of having adopted a domineering approach that turned off many who dealt with the company .
indeed , analysts and even mr lay admit he never really let go of the strings .
enron is one of several energy traders facing questions in california over alleged manipulation of prices - which it denies .
by andrew hill and sheila mcnulty jeff skilling receiveda cream pie in the face when he went to san francisco in june to address a meeting .
in the past six months there have been accusations that enron manipulated power prices in california ; legal battles in india over its attempt to pull out of a project near bombay ; and a halving of its share price from last year 's peak of dollars 90 .
on tuesday came the surprise announcement that mr skilling would step down as chief executive and president for personal reasons , to be replaced by kenneth lay , enron 's chairman and mr skilling 's predecessor as chief executive .
mr skilling told analysts that his resignation had nothing to do with enron .
enron was not alone , even if it was among the most aggressive in its attempt to pioneer new markets .
the enron case is slightly different , because it was mr lay who led the company through its strong growth phase , although mr skilling was a fundamental part of the strategy and increasingly the frontman for the company even before he took over as chief executive .
mr lay repeated yesterday that he believed the company was fundamentally strong .
by sheila mcnulty in houston kenneth lay , enron chairman , yesterday reassumed the positions of chief executive officer and president of the texas energy giant following the surprise departure of jeff skilling .
pm et speculation 's swirling around jeff skilling 's abrupt departure from energy giant enron ( ene on tuesday , for what he would only say were " personal reasons .
enron shares traded down as much as 14 % early wednesday before closing at $ 40.25 , down $ 2.68 or 6.2 % " i reject the notion that this is a very good time to leave , " says mcintyre .
the $ 22 million question while both skilling and enron chairman ken lay , former -- and now current -- president and ceo , maintain that skilling left for personal reasons and of his own volition , the shroud of secrecy over the specifics is troubling to both investors and pundits -- including my colleague james j. cramer .
sources at enron would not elaborate , but insisted that skilling , 47 , did not resign for health reasons .
so if the enron ship is on course , skilling is n't ill and timing really was n't an issue , why would n't he either wait until december to resign or announce his resignation but make it effective dec. 31 and collect the extra $ 2 million ?

earlier this week , sen. joe lieberman ( d - ct ) made a thoughtful speech about the success of new democrats in reviving their party 's traditional commitment to a " foreign policy that was values - based and fully engaged , a defense policy that was muscular and modern , and an economic policy that was internationalist .
but lieberman made news in his address to the fall conference of the new democrat network by openly saying what many americans have privately concluded during the last month : the logic of the president 's well - articulated position on the scope of the war on terrorism means that we can not necessarily limit military action to afghanistan .
moreover , said lieberman , " it should make us unflinching in our determination to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq before he , emboldened by september 11 , strikes at us with weapons of mass destruction .
lieberman is one of the few elected officials from either party to publicly connect the dots between our proclaimed war on any form of terrorism " with global reach , " and the obvious existence of a middle eastern rogue state that is sponsoring terrorism , pursuing weapons of mass destruction , continuing to threaten its neighbors , and is dedicated to the elimination of the u.s. presence in the region -- much of it necessitated , of course , by iraq 's continued behavior .
the president has eloquently and repeatedly said any country that is not on our side in the war on terrorism must be treated as a " hostile power .
by any measure , iraq is a supremely hostile power that shares every anti - american impulse of both al qaeda and the taliban , while having far superior means for attacking us .
this line of argument is reminiscent of the reasoning behind the decision in 1991 to leave hussein in power in iraq , followed by an unsuccessful sanctions regime and the permanent stationing of u.s. troops in the persian gulf region .
whatever you think about that decision and its consequences , it 's clear now that we can not let excessive concern for political stability and coalition - building keep the united states from destroying the terrorist network and protecting our country from terrorist threats that continue every day .
but especially in the case of an attack on the united states itself , multilateralism should not become an excuse for inaction .
does this mean we have to go to war in iraq ?
as joe lieberman rightly said : " our fundamental principles are at least as much on the line in this war against terrorism as they were in our battles with nazism and communism during the last century .

saturday 's la times on a new twist in the california power shortage story pollution rules tighten squeeze on power supply by nancy vogel
i was flying by the seat of my pants , " said richard baldwin , head of the ventura county air pollution control district , who hurriedly struck a deal last week to keep a gas - fired turbine running on the ventura county coast .
under the deal , reliant will pay the air district $ 4,000 for every hour it runs the relatively dirty plant the rest of the year .
those air quality districts could just throw up their hands and say no , not our problem , " said winter , executive director of the california independent system operator , the nonprofit entity that runs most of california 's electric grid , " but they have all been very responsive .

at the october 29th hearing in san jose , the industrial welfare commission ( iwc ) approved an amendment of the statement as to the basis of wage order 5 , rejecting the controversial letter written by mr. miles locker , former chief counsel , division of labor standards enforcement ( dlse ) , that prohibited any deductions from exempt employee 's salary in increments of less than one - month during temporary plant shut down .
however , ab 60 did not contain any language that specifically prohibited wage deductions from exempt employees in increments of less than one month .
while the amendment clearly indicates where the commission stands on the issue , according to commission chair , bill dombrowski , ( amendment passed on a 4 - 1 vote ) it only applies to wage order 5 ( public housekeeping ) and not to the other 14 orders .
wage order 5 was the only order open at the october 29 meeting so the commission did not have the authority to clarify the issue by revising all of the wage orders .

by ian christopher mccaleb / cnn washington --
two highly sensitive computer hard drives that were missing from the los alamos national laboratories earlier this year never left the premises , and the fbi has uncovered no hints of espionage in the case , energy secretary bill richardson told a senate committee wednesday .
in a statement opening a lengthy and touchy hearing of senate armed services committee , richardson said : " based upon the investigation by the fbi so far , there is no evidence of espionage , nor is there evidence the drives have ever left los alamos . "
i will not take ( disciplinary ) action until i have all the facts before me , " he said , vowing , " i will not rest until i know what happened -- when , where , why and by whom .
during his watch , los alamos scientist wen ho lee was removed from his position amid charges of spying .
members of congress have also raised red flags over the reported sale of computers once used at the savannah river nuclear weapons facility in augusta , georgia .
mr. secretary , " warner said directly to richardson , " on june 23rd of last year you told this committee , in this room : ' the secretary of energy , ' and i quote you , ' ... must be accountable and must be responsible " for such security failures .
harsher still was the criticism leveled by sen. robert byrd ( d - west virginia ) , a member of richardson 's own party , who said richardson 's pledges to get to the bottom of the case would not sway the opinion of the senate , whose trust he had lost permanently .
richardson , who at times looked stunned by the tone taken by many committee members , sought to defend himself -- arguing that he wanted to have " all the facts " in hand before making a congressional appearance .
sen. james inhofe ( r - oklahoma ) suggested that the " captain of the ship " was n't richardson , but president bill clinton , who inhofe said was responsible for a variety of security policy changes and leaks to the media that have led to a relaxed , careless attitude among those charged with overseeing the nation 's weapons secrets . '
serious loss of control over classified information ' also appearing before the panel was dr. john browne , director of the los alamos facility .
he said the fallout from the security breach was " too political , " adding , " i did not utter one partisan word in that committee .
but sources familiar with the investigation told cnn on tuesday that this account has come under suspicion because of " conflicting statements " made during interviews and polygraph tests .
browne , the lab 's director , has testified that security rules for the tracking of items classified as secret were eased government - wide in 1992 to reduce the cost of handling the large amount of documents carrying this designation .
data indicates no fire - unleashed radiation at los alamos fire moves onto los alamos nuclear lab property ; 14,000 area residents evacuated fbi told taiwan - born physicist he failed polygraph exam that he passed related sites los alamos national laboratory department of energy house committee on commerce : 106th congress university of california , berkeley federal bureau of investigation atomic energy act and related legislation

since 1997 by 20 % --- partnership dealings cited as dynegy talks go on ; debt ratings an issue
shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the california state government pay an estimated $ 1.6 billion for past power purchases .
the enron sec filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor , arthur andersen llp , which reviewed the company 's annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals .
enron 's restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company 's many strange transactions with related parties .
but the restatement should , at the least , cause investors and wall street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so - called pro forma earnings , which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules .
the question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one .
kenneth lay , the enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies -- and whose influential friends include president bush -- is the one who points to the bleachers .
dynegy 's chairman and chief executive , charles l. watson , is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts .
when electricity markets around the united states were deregulated , the companies followed clearly divergent paths .
yet enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast .
the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility , and as a result , once again is threatening north american gas producers . ' '
details of those charges were not disclosed , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions . ' '

while the transactions themselves do not appear to have been illegal , the way some of them were recorded in enron 's financial statements led to the corrections .

she also wonders why ken lay , enron 's chairman and chief executive , is apparently willing to sell enron at such a low price .
what has hammered enron 's securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , the chief financial officer , who was finally forced to go on leave .
these partnership deals were never really disclosed , except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved .
why should investors who are n't owners of enron stock or bonds care ?
but the sec has publicly questioned the company 's prospects , the existence of its alleged contracts , and the identity of its managers .
so it ca n't simply blame the premature disclosure on someone else 's bad judgment .
two years after the nyse was embroiled in an illegal trading scandal , oversight of floor brokers is still too lax , according to government regulators .
in 1999 , nine brokers pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to schemes in which they took a share of trading profits .
there are broad variations across companies as to whether they are democracies or dictatorships , " said andrew metrick , a finance professor at the wharton school of business , who wrote the study with paul gompers and joy ishii of harvard university .
typical provisions included poison pills , which allow all pro - management shareholders to buy stock at discounts during takeover attempts diluting the power of the hostile bidder ; super - majority votes , which require from 66 to 85 per cent approval for a management change rather than a majority ; golden parachutes , which give large compensation packages to executives who are fired or demoted ; and classified boards , whereby board members ' terms are staggered , preventing them from all being ousted at the same time .
other investors in the energy merchant have already filed law suits against company officials , alleging fraud and seeking to recover their lost share value , estimated at $ 20bn over the last month .

it also fired treasurer ben glisan and a division general counsel , saying it believed they had made personal investments in some of these partnerships , whose activities have led to conflict of interest accusations by shareholders against senior enron officials and board members .
bond - rating companies have sharply cut their ratings on enron 's bonds since these disclosures , and its debt is now one step above junk status , by some ratings .
that debt is to investors who purchased assets from enron , including a water system in britain and other holdings .
06:40 pm est url : enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) still has n't come clean on the shadowy deals that led to many of the company 's problems .
enron did take some of raptor 's hedging losses itself , but it did so through a $ 711 million pretax charge , which it chose to exclude from operating earnings in the third quarter .
in october , enron replaced chief financial officer andrew fastow because of his involvement in the partnerships .
the company said there was no admission of liability on its part , nor violation of any state or federal regulations .
enron , also based in houston , owns wessex water , for which it paid pounds 1.4bn in 1998 , and gas - fired power stations in britain , including the high - performing 1900mw teesside plant .
now , in no small part because of its executives ' own highhandedness and dismissive treatment of those same investors and analysts , enron 's reputation is in tatters , the u.s. securities and exchange commission is probing billions of dollars worth of off - balance - sheet transactions , its once high - flying stock has tanked , its bonds are trading at levels usually reserved for troubled junk and the lawsuits are flying thick and fast .
the former ceo once used a seven - letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to ask for a balance sheet during an earnings conference call .
the crisis surrounding enron , the beleaguered american energy trading group with power plant and trading investments in britain , deepened yesterday with the dismissal of two key executives alleged to be involved in off - balance - sheet operations now under investigation by regulatory authorities .

the suit was filed on behalf of enron , to redress damages to the company from enron 's investments in limited partnerships which were controlled by andrew fastow , enron 's then chief financial officer , and approved by enron 's board of directors .

still undecided : who 'll pay dwr for electricity by karen gaudette associated press san francisco -- the price tag is $ 3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state department of water resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities .
so do the state power regulators , who have the final call over who gets the money when .
but after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity , payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses , there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the dwr without sinking further into debt , pg&e spokesman ron low said tuesday .

the public is in a very awkward position , " said michael shames , executive director of the utility consumers ' action network in san diego .
people will die in california because of this crisis , " rep. brad sherman , a los angeles - area republican , warned the house energy and commerce committee .
sherman , who was one of about a dozen california lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze , drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if west coast states did n't agree on the same time standard .
most of the committee 's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several california and western lawmakers , primarily democrats , to require the federal energy regulatory commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage .
power plan called wrong wall street analysts say the governor 's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance .
the two utilities , denied credit by suppliers , say they have lost nearly $ 14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state 's industry - deregulation law says they can not pass on to consumers .
in december , ferc imposed a " soft cap " of $ 150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge .
the system discourages generators from building new power plants because they are n't guaranteed a profit , and it does n't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay does n't reflect the true cost of power , fremont said .
davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating , transporting and distributing power , but the added cost of paying off the two utilities ' massive debt and buying their transmission lines , said assemblyman fred keeley , d - boulder creek , the assembly 's chief power negotiator .
legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in california stalled tuesday , as democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators -- some of them campaign donors -- stood to receive higher payments than others .
it is illegal , it is unethical and it 's not how i do business , " he said .
that prompted energy committee chairwoman debra bowen ( d - marina del rey ) to retort : " i 'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy .
they sell the electricity to the utilities , which in turn transmit it to retail consumers .
edison international and the san francisco - based consumer group , the utility reform network , opposed it .
michael florio of the utility reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices ; an edison representative said the same thing .
s. david freeman , the general manager of the los angeles department of water and power and davis ' negotiator , said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals .
wednesday , march 7 , 2001 , 2001 san francisco chronicle state regulators are set to decide today whether debt - ridden pacific gas and electric co. and southern california edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip .

it 's no secret that within the confines of fooldom , we 're not enamored with tax - deferred annuities ( tdas ) .
we do not find ourselves waxing eloquent , sending chocolates , or writing foolish love poems to annuities , as we sometimes do to individual stocks .
as an example , in 1998 the total return ( i.e. , capital gains and dividends ) for the s&p 500 index as reported by ibbotson associates was 28.6 % , while that for just capital gains ( i.e. , market price ) was 26.7 % .
if , after evaluating all those factors , an annuity still appears appropriate , then as fools we also urge the purchase of a low - cost annuity such as one offered by vanguard , t. rowe price , fidelity , annuitynet.com , or ( in some states )
why pay commissions and high expenses when you do n't have to ?

for anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of public utilities , the most recent installment of the miserable enron story as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy .
enron sold many of its generating plants and became the biggest " power broker " in the nation .
though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked california consumers of tens of billions of dollars , enron was one of the first power barons to take advantage of california 's flawed deregulation law -- virtually written by in - state and out - of- state utility companies .
the california fiasco soured ( probably ) most americans on utility deregulation , but enron was not singled out for calumny , and management saw no reason to examine its business ethics .
the chief executive , kenneth l. lay , was and is a personal friend of george w. bush and has easy access to the white house .
in 2000 , enron and its employees gave $ 113,000 to bush 's campaign , $ 250,000 to the republican national committee , and $ 300,000 to the presidential inauguration committee .
or , in light of our preoccupation with terrorism , will the enron case get much attention from the federal government ?

the intimidation campaign against new york radio talk - show personality " grandpa " al lewis 's website isp is by no means unique .
recent efforts to suppress the voices of ideological opponents are widespread and not limited to one particular ideology or viewpoint .
while " grandpa munster " drew ire for his outspoken views in opposition to the u.s. government responses to the sept. 11th atrocities , some on american college campuses have been reprimanded for voicing support for the u.s. military response -- or even for simply displaying american flags , according to paul craig roberts , research fellow at the independent institute .
it is permissible to burn the american flag on university campuses .
college administrators on some campuses have ordered the removal of american flags from student dorm rooms and school buses , and banned the staff of a university tv station from wearing red , white and blue ribbons .
one arabic - speaking ethiopian student was put on warning when he chastised three arab students he heard " expressing their delight in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , " writes roberts .

the settlement -- still to be approved by the federal judge assigned to the case and several state attorneys general -- would require microsoft to adopt certain specific operating practices ( namely to stop engaging in exclusive dealing arrangements with computer makers , share its windows source code with competitors , and allow computer makers more freedom to display non - microsoft software applications ) .
in short , the government got virtually nothing from this legal monstrosity of a lawsuit , which is precisely what it deserves , " armentano writes .
microsoft , on the other hand , is a clear and decisive winner on the issue that first sparked the lawsuit : the tying of its web browser to its operating system .
like the antitrust prosecution of ibm in the 1970s and early ' 80s , the microsoft antitrust case was without merit , and illustrate the need to fundamentally reform or repeal antitrust policies , according to armentano .

why are the public schools failing and
but why did n't california legislators attempt genuine deregulation ?
more broadly , why is deregulation so seldom attempted anywhere , despite the fact the economists routinely take pains to show how regulation is wasteful ?
while this is often a factor , there are several other reasons why regulations become entrenched , according to economist fred s. mcchesney .
here mcchesney relies on the notion of a ratchet effect ( described in detail in independent institute senior fellow robert higgs 's book , crisis and leviathan ) : each new government regulation or program creates a new baseline from which it rarely if ever retreats .
see " of stranded costs and stranded hopes " by fred s. mcchesney ( the independent review , spring 1999 ) , at for an examination of regulatory lock - in during the reagan administration , see the independent institute book , regulation and the reagan era , edited by roger meiners and bruce yandle , at for the independent institute 's archive on energy policy , see world freedom index

~ the gore campaign knows that the only way to get the votes they need is to keep changing the rules .
this election must be decided by the rules that existed on election day , not the rules rewritten by the gore campaign in a politically charged environment two weeks later .

dynegy , whose bond rating is under pressure , may face a lawsuit from enron and questions from investors about why it did n't scrutinize enron 's books more closely , the times said .
dynegy 's efforts to buy a natural gas pipeline that is one of enron 's most valuable assets for $ 1.5 billion might not pan out either because enron said it will fight to keep the pipeline out of dynegy 's hands , the times reported .

this bill bars the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) from raising rates back to the pre-10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate reduction period has expired on march 31 , 2002 .
although the state continues to argue that the $ 8.9 billion figure is correct , ferc judge curtis wagner called the figure " baseless " and criticized the california delegation for " not negotiating in good faith " during the recent settlement discussions .
this amendment " ties " the ultimate fate of ab 28xx to the fate of ab 39xx , unless the double - joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the governor for signature , assuming the bill gets to the governor .
given the failure of sb 39xx in committee , ab 28xx is effectively " dead " as well for the moment ( see discussion of ab 28xx above . )
posted at 12:27 p.m. pdt monday , aug. 6 , 2001 ferc chairman to resign washington ( ap ) -- curtis hebert , a target of congressional democrats and california 's governor over his handling of the western power crisis , is resigning at the end of the month as chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission .
white house spokeswoman ann womack said monday that hebert submitted his resignation in a letter to president bush delivered to the white house on friday .
hebert , a republican from mississippi and close friend of senate republican leader trent lott , was named ferc chairman by bush in january .
at the time , hebert was the only republican on the five - member commission because of two vacancies .
hebert , a strong free - market advocate , has defended electricity deregulation and vigorously opposed ferc 's imposing price controls in california even as his critics said the western electricity markets were out of control and not working .
he frequently clashed with one of the commission 's democratic members , william massey , over ferc 's role in assuring that just and reasonable prices are charged by western power marketers .
california gov. gray davis and the state 's two senators -- democrats dianne feinstein and barbara boxer -- have blamed hebert for ferc 's failure to move aggressively in curtailing power prices in the west and its refusal to demand tens of billions of dollars in refunds of high prices charged california for power .

the energy committee is deeply divided between free - market stalwarts , who argue temporary controls on california 's wholesale electricity and natural gas prices will distort the market , and others who say price controls are needed to stop market manipulation and prevent a regional economic disaster .
however , president bush , an opponent of price controls , still wields veto power .
, said rep. joe barton 's , r - texas , electricity emergency relief act - the bill currently before the panel - does n't live up to its name because it does n't direct the federal energy regulatory commission to impose wholesale power price controls .

the problem persists as all three utilities in the state face high wholesale electricity prices .
since competition began in the state in the spring of 1998 , the three california ious were required to buy their power from the state 's power exchange .

the state enron records to stay secret court los angeles times 09/07/2001
despite energy companies ' claims that california is a bad place to do business , dozens of electricity generators want to cash in on low- cost state loans to build power plants .
we 'll be the wal - mart of energy , " said freeman , who is one of four authority members appointed by gov. gray davis .
skyrocketing natural gas prices last winter led in part to the surging electricity prices that bankrupted pacific gas and electric co. and plunged the state into crisis .
freeman said dozens of energy companies , including enron and reliant , had submitted proposals to erect gas - fired peaker power plants .
a conservative appointee to the state public utilities commission blocked a vote yesterday on banning businesses from cutting private electricity deals with generators , saying he wanted to give more firms time to sign up .
the letter was prompted by an aug. 29 dow jones newswires report that the iso directed edison to ramp down its low - cost , 1,500-megawatt mohave generating station in nevada at various times in recent months .
the report cited iso sources saying the motivation was to prevent the dwr from selling its contracted power supplies at a loss .
i am very concerned that the cal iso , in concert or collusion with the department of water resources , is abusing its broad authority over the transmission of electrical power over interstate power lines in order to avoid political embarrassment for the davis administration , " jones wrote .
this abuse , because it involves the interstate transmission of electrical power , must be investigated by your agency under the authority granted to you by the federal power act , " jones said in the letter to wood , who was unavailable for comment wednesday .
for months now , competitive power providers have been asking ferc to decide whether the iso meets the commission 's requirements for independent governance , given that its board is appointed by davis and the state is deeply involved in power markets .
those sources say they expect the commission to ultimately act on the matter , and rule that the politically appointed board runs afoul of ferc 's requirement for independence from market participants .
it 's completely false to say we 're in collusion with cal iso , " said dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo , calling jones 's allegations " really reaching " and without merit .
the allegations were made during a hearing into power prices that began on wednesday in washington , d.c. , by the united states federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) .
cdwr 's statements are " inappropriate " because alleged overcharging in the california market is already being addressed in a separate ferc proceeding , she said .
we believe they [ alleged overcharges ] are a separate issue and are already being dealt with , " she said yesterday .
ms. odowichuk said that powerex was a net power importer during the period in question , and that the company believes the allegations against it are unfounded .
the state of california maintains it is owed almost $ 9-billion in refunds from power sellers .
in comments filed at the utilities commission earlier this week , pacific gas & electric said the rate agreement would be illegal because assembly bill 1x -- which put the state in the energy - purchasing business in january -- does not allow customers to be charged for dwr power that is not delivered to them .
california entered the power business when a surge in wholesale electricity prices and a regulatory freeze on consumer rates created billions of dollars in losses for the two utilities .
pg&e said one section of the draft rate agreement would require the utilities commission to order that dwr power be delivered to utility customers whenever the water agency requests , " even if the dwr power is millions , if not billions , of dollars more expensive than the utilities ' own power supplies or power available from third parties .
in july , the state racked up $ 46 million in losses after selling excess power for one - fifth the price it paid .
even without a rate increase , the bill has been bitterly opposed by consumer activists , who have labeled it a bailout and have threatened a ballot initiative to reverse it .
at the end of the day , the people of the state of california are going to have to depend on john burton and the senate to stop this obscene giveaway .
california 's largest utility , pacific gas & electric co. , chose to take itself into bankruptcy in the spring rather than seek a government solution to its problems , and the lights did not go dark in northern california as a result .
but davis and other supporters of the bill argued that the state 's only way out of the power crisis is to have the private utilities regain their financial health .
and only a surprising republican vote from assemblyman bill leonard of san bernardino allowed the bill to clear the assembly 's energy committee .
democratic lawmakers contend those companies engaged in price gouging during the energy crisis and are opposed to giving them all they are owed .
they do n't get any money from this , not one dime .
corp. must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state senate committee investigating possible price manipulation of wholesale energy prices , a judge rules .
ross johnson , r - irvine , tries to amend a bill in the senate to cut the salary of s. david freeman , chairman of the california consumer power and conservation financing authority .
commissioners postponed voting on the controversial issue of suspending ratepayer choice enacted as part of the state 's deregulated power market .
we 're being negligent in failing to respond to this threat not only to the viability of the state bond issue but to basic fairness , " wood said .
while there 's a general expectation in the market that the power bond deal will get done , it 's not guaranteed , so people are keeping their eye on the developments , " blair said .
there is nothing on god 's green earth that can justify that differential , " pg&e senior vice president dan richard said .
state treasurer philip angelides said this week that once the rans are issued , the state will have enough money to cover its power costs until the middle of next year .
consumer groups have been leading the campaign against the bill which they consider a bail - out at the expense of the utility 's ratepayers .
the california public utilities commission on thursday delayed again a vote to suspend retail power choice , one of the cornerstones of the state 's 1996 electricity deregulation law .
cpuc commissioner carl wood said that despite " populist rhetoric " about retail choice in the deregulation law , big businesses demanded that the option be included so they could switch power suppliers and " avoid paying their share " of past debts incurred by the utilities .
when power shortages sent wholesale power prices soaring last year , independent power suppliers " dumped their customers back on the utilities , " wood said .
the deregulation law blocked them from passing their power costs to consumers .

are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits and , if so , should price caps be imposed to protect ratepayers ?
whether or not individual generators are trying to manipulate is not the question and price caps are certainly not the answer .
in addition , one must remember that the vast majority of generation remains under regulatory and/or legislated prices -- only about 10 % is actually " bid " and cleared ; no wonder the market thinness has lead to volatility .
second price auction certainly does n't help , since everybody gets paid whatever ( the one manipulating ? ) is the highest bidder 's bid .
the other half is meaningful demand responsive behavior -- price caps will hide true costs from consumers and stifle that too .
the answer to your second question , then , is that price caps are clearly re - regulation and anti - free market .
why else would generation be reduced " for economic reasons " ?
the concept of deregulation was to enhance competition through freedom of choice of the end user , not the supplier .
this is five times more than consumers ever paid for energy .
until investors , customers , and employees stand as one against utilities selling off all their generation , this situation will continue to be one of simple market economics ( supply vs. demand ) .
the only winners are the executives of these utilities as they get rewarded for the high sale prices of the plants , while customers are exposed to higher prices and lower reliability and , sadly , employees lose jobs , pay level , and seniority that are hard , if not impossible , to replace .
if there is manipulation of prices , price caps are not the way to penalize the criminals because price caps affect every single seller , not the individual or handful of individuals who are restraining the market and acting against the public interest .
in high dudgeon the politicians intervene and impose a cap of x - 10 , which captures the bad actors but also unfortunately penalizes all of the other actors in the market , slam dunking them in order to stop the few bad actors .
what is with california and price controls ?
/ a are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits in san diego ?
so , just as we have been saying for more than four years , deregulation will only lead to unregulated monopolies , because of the physical and economic nature of the electric power itself , and because no one has the political power to enact the structural reforms needed to overcome the power of the for - profit holding companies that still completely dominate this industry .
is anyone complaining , when during light load periods , the price of power is low and at times
hot weather and lack of surplus capacity caused the price spikes and price caps now just prolong the pain .
the state of california 's actions in imposing wholesale price caps is a simple issue of politically motivated interference in the free market that will ultimately harm consumers .
