[P_90] york -(dow jones)- banks [P_91] prepared to tighten the coordination between credit risks they are exposed to in different markets , as they adapt to the changing requirements of the basel accord on capital requirements , a federal reserve study says .
specifically , the report cites exposure to derivatives as one [P_93] broader and more tightly [P_95] models of credit risk are likely to be a future requirement for banks .
[P_90] york federal reserve study , entitled " using credit risk [P_94] regulatory capital : issues and options , " is [P_97] publication in a forthcoming economic policy review .
when questioned , hirtle said the study 's reference to derivatives and to [P_94] for some banks to tighten correlations among different instruments of credit risk [P_99] was n't based on specific [P_911] problems in the financial sector .
for positions that involve derivatives or that otherwise [P_92] to a material extent on market [P_95] , standards likely would require integrated models of market movements and credit exposures , " the report said .
she also gave an example in [P_92] of how a chain of events [P_94] lower the worth of a credit for a bank .
the coming [P_90] the basel accord , planned for introduction by 2004 , aim [P_95] the way that banks globally [P_97] for risk .
nobuaki kurisu , chief fund [P_91] sumisei global investment trust management , also cited derivatives -related selling as a factor in the stock market 's plunge , and added that such selling should keep market volatility high for the time being , making institutional investors [P_915] buy .
the rush to hedge equity linked derivative bonds , which usually [P_93] in six months to one year , offer higher interest rates than ordinary bonds if the nikkei stays above a pre - determined level .
but once the nikkei drops below that level , the return at the bond 's maturity will [P_95] than [P_96] investment .
it is designed to serve as a kind of calculation device to determine who [P_94] file under chapter 13 and who [P_97] file under chapter 7 .
the bill now must wait until the senate passes its version before a conference [P_94] appointed [P_95] out differences between the two bills ( see related report in this section ) .
bonds that had previously been trading at a 60 [P_93] suddenly be tendered at par .
[P_90] insurance credit default swaps stipulate that in one of several possible events - the declaration of a bankruptcy ; the failure to pay [P_98] on a loan or bond , or the restructuring , repudiation or acceleration of a loan that lowers [P_914] creditworthiness of a counterparty - the buyer of [P_917] may deliver to the seller any loan or bond extending out to a predefined maturity , and receive back par value in return .
nobody wants to throw a company into bankruptcy [P_92] 's a glimmer of [P_94] a [P_95] turn around [P_97] .
since the loan was renegotiated on the last day of the contract , bofa certainly [P_95] considered it a repaid loan , and then extended a [P_99] loan if it had [P_910] couch it in such terms , " says one dealer .
that path would have avoided [P_91] default .
the credit derivatives market has effectively bifurcated itself into two distinctly different products , and although it has n't yet reached a critical stage , participants are concerned that this bifurcation [P_910] hurt [P_911] market liquidity .
for example , would a bank give up its collection rights on a $ 20 million credit default swap if it had $ 1 billion in total loans [P_99] be thrown into the nonperforming category by a bankruptcy declaration ?
the conseco situation showed how a [P_92] default [P_92] trigger a credit derivatives exercise , but without the debt of the underlying company being truly hurt .
we have to establish a better standard for interdealer business , or risk less liquidity and a [P_95] of added basis risk within dealer books .
although [P_90] consensus will not [P_91] , kennaugh 's [P_93] that some standard acceptable to investors , hedgers and dealers alike [P_97] established .
the language to accomplish [P_91] require some tricky drafting , but the goal [P_94] to give sellers of credit derivatives more solace that they could not be blindsided on a loan restructuring with the delivery of longer - dated paper , while [P_914] of [P_915] swaps would still maintain the regulatory ability to tender restructured paper .
this compromise , however , [P_91] a " two - step delivery option .
on the occasion of a loan restructuring , the holder of a credit default swap [P_95] either tender the actual loan affected or a similar short - term piece of debt , or hold onto [P_912] derivative for the possibility of an actual bankruptcy event at a [P_917] .
in other words , [P_91] be one central contract , but with a new delivery twist within it .
[P_90] introduce too much uncertainty into the delivery process .
given [P_90] underlying credits , however , the specific drafting required here [P_95] even more [P_96] participants to agree on [P_98] .
such an approach might result [P_91] documentation mismatches and basis risk on dealer books , but it [P_96] keep diverse end - user participants more satisfied .
people will trade what contracts they [P_92] trade , and [P_93] have to wait [P_95] which contract [P_96] be .
if banks [P_90] relief with restructuring included , that price exists today and [P_94] to exist .
it 's easy to imagine yet another situation where xerox [P_93] technically fall into default on certain obligations , but continue to pay interest on other paper .
lawsuits have n't sprung from the conseco situation , but [P_93] for xerox since there is more money on the table .
if more credit problems flare up [P_92] , isda [P_93] come under even more scrutiny , with conseco simply having been the first warning shot across the bow of the credit derivatives market .
it has been approved by ben and chris booth and should [P_93] to sandridge [P_95] today .

[P_90] achieves the two main objectives of the ppi [P_93] : it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients .
[P_90] the response of [P_91] to wildly - varying rpi [P_94] curve , a sine wave of period 3 years for rpi was [P_98] into the ppi model .

[P_90] plotted [P_91] in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue .
dear all , [P_91] it [P_92] brent crude as an explanatory variable for ppi ; it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long - term average of $ 18.80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is used ) .
as [P_90] see , the two equations [P_92] in the [P_93] - term and [P_95] - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term predictions of 3.0 % to 3.2 % over the [P_914] months .

with respect to transmission grids , it [P_92] used to describe both paths and flowgates .
when i wrote " the more granular the flowgate model " [P_93] , i meant " [P_95] the scale of your transmission model by flowgates " ; in fact , i had the " into wscc " example [P_913] at the time , whereby someone in the eastern interconnection [P_917] conceivably purchase a transmission right to send energy westward to a sink anywhere in the western interconnection .
i hate to always burden [P_91] questions , but you are knowledgeable on [P_94] and i [P_96] to get up to speed .
i guess i owe you a [P_92] beers now .
i 'll reply to [P_91] in the order you wrote them .

as drafted , [P_91] would have no effect [P_93] practices in the east , so more than one version of each bp [P_98] unnecessary .
i would say that bp 24 does not [P_92] the choice of congestion management method selected .

i do n't care which way [P_92] .
i am [P_90] that between don , leslie , and stacey [P_93] get some clear direction on what you [P_96] us to do .
as of now , there is little i [P_92] brandon with his request for a cash flow projection .
there are conflicting reports that houston , through the estate , [P_93] scheduling in enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating enpower accordingly .
what i am [P_91] for is that by whatever communications means necessary [P_94] come to a final [P_96] on how to clean this and get enpower up to date [P_910] and as accurately [P_912] .
we have everything recorded on our trade sheets , but if [P_93] settle or relay to the estate by us making [P_99] in deal scheduling , [P_911] do so .
i also understand , after talking to john , [P_93] our trade sheets for such [P_96] for the month of december .

this first step ensures that a [P_92] not [P_93] capacity if the demand for that [P_95] be filled by [P_97] shippers relinquishing their capacity .
the second step is that the expansion shippers must [P_93] to purchase capacity at a rate that pays the full costs of [P_97] , without subsidy [P_99] shippers through rolled - in pricing .

[P_90] my friend nicholas bollini for [P_92] on this one .
delegates at the bonn climate change negotiations are expected [P_93] through saturday [P_94] decisions that will " [P_96] and give full effect " to the agreement .
[P_90] , developed countries want the u.s. on board and this leaves [P_94] the bush administration [P_95] an alternative -- though the [P_98] close shortly .
it is too early to tell [P_92] issues will impact competitiveness or whether they [P_95] interpreted as non - tariff trade barriers .
[P_90] , only parties to the protocol can [P_92] the market - based mechanisms under the protocol ( emissions trading , and [P_97] - mechanisms [P_98] countries through the clean [P_910] mechanism , [P_911] based mechanisms in other developed countries through joint implementation ) .
because [P_90] are not yet [P_92] , it is unclear whether enron [P_94] participate in mechanisms or trading through offices in other countries outside the u.s.
it will be [P_91] the u.s. [P_92] linkages with the market - based mechanisms to enhance a global market for greenhouse gas emissions credits and lower compliance costs for firms with obligations .
[P_90] more costly and burdensome reductions in [P_93] for u.s. firms ( as the u.s. [P_96] a more stringent target to meet ) .
clean [P_90] mechanism and ji nuclear power [P_92] are not permitted under the cdm or ji afforestation and reforestation are the only eligible sequestration [P_98] under the cdm small [P_99] " fast track " window in the cdm for renewable energy [P_913] < 15 mw , for efficiency and [P_916] equivalent to less than 15 gwh per year , and for [P_920] emitting [P_920] reduce emissions and with emissions of less than 15,000 tons per year .
most of you are aware that unify experienced some major performance issues [P_94] tried to [P_95] the month of july .
not to go [P_91] there seemed to [P_93] a lot of [P_94] issues which when combined caused the [P_97] saw on monday and to a lesser degree on tuesday .
jeff johnson and his team are [P_92] a plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in acceptable performance as we go [P_98] bidweek and [P_910] close for august .
the short term tactical plans include the following : enhancing certain programs which seem to have become [P_95] hogs as the amount of data grows .
[P_90] hopefully migrate to the [P_92] of sybase which [P_93] address some of [P_95] .
[P_90] some hardware [P_92] to where we store certain data .
[P_90] some user [P_92] prior [P_93] .
this puts quite a load on the pma and accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions [P_97] what if any action should be taken with these transactions .
once [P_90] have been implemented and hopefully bought us a [P_93] to absorb the tremendous growth we 've been [P_97] eol then [P_98] focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions .
but we have to [P_91] it is the right solution in the long term .
jeff [P_90] of you to go over a much [P_94] plan .
we [P_90] we [P_92] the tactical solutions .

in order for us to [P_91] a master agreement for the counterparty [P_94] in order for them to tell us what credit terms we [P_910] include in the master agreement .
also , because ena does not trade brazilian power i believe [P_93] have [P_94] out an arrangement on the commercial side to have ena enter into the deal and back - to - back it out again to another appropriate enron entity to manage the risk .

[P_90] product [P_91] or have a web site question , [P_94] e - mail [ image ]
well , i [P_91] everyone is having a save and fun [P_93] .
the [P_90] is that i got a digital camera so there [P_94] a lot more pictures [P_96] the family [P_97] .
the bad news is that i got a digital camera and there will be a lot more pictures [P_96] the family [P_97] .
anyways , its been [P_91] from christmas , check [P_93] the [P_94] as [P_95] probably be more from [P_97] to the desert this weekend .
lousie seems to [P_91] you [P_92] the u.s. version of this .
vince , i have added a lot of material to " [P_93] the wholes " and [P_95] to the current draft .
[P_90] a [P_91] day and tremendous [P_93] the [P_94] .
those should [P_90] be part of a class on risk management .
the last of the warm air [P_92] scoured out of the east today with near [P_95] for most of the country [P_98] .
a very active southern jet stream [P_92] spin up two more significant winter storms [P_94] weekend .
imagine [P_90] if only there was more cold air in [P_93] .
the current storm [P_91] drive out most of the available [P_93] , but some lake effect is [P_96] some light snow amounts should occur .
however , the set up [P_91] for some sort of low pressure [P_94] in the vicinity of the gulf coast [P_97] week .
it would head toward the se us [P_92] factor .
it has had it for three runs in a row , but given the high surface pressures does not [P_96] as cold as i [P_98] have expected .
i [P_90] most areas to run near or slightly [P_93] .
we [P_90] going to [P_91] accounting memo [P_93] .
finally , there are some conceptual points that i believe should [P_93] w/ relation to [P_95] structure for " softs " trading we have been [P_99] .
i have [P_90] up [P_91] and decide whether i 'm going to fill potholes out on rt .
i have [P_90] up [P_91] and decide > whether > i 'm going to fill potholes out on rt .
i [P_90] with regret , as i [P_92] all of you , and i believe ebs is poised for [P_97] asia .
[P_90] in a smooth [P_91] , i have prepared this report on the status of all ebs east asia regulatory affairs actions i am [P_98] , and [P_99] about [P_910] .
again , many , [P_91] and for what i have learned about broadband and ebs from each of you .
we can not [P_91] on the application until we decide what legal entity to use .
this is a [P_91] option in my opinion as the regulator ( ida ) does not [P_95] at cross purposes with other parts of the government that [P_910] ebs with incentives .
for example it [P_91] that jan haizmann or others [P_93] figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee ( done offshore for example ) .
jan i believe [P_91] on this that he adanced in the context of korea .
i believe [P_90] prudent to [P_92] as we had planned to engage a law firm here in singapore ( as we have in [P_98] kong and [P_99] ) for the purpose of guiding [P_912] these sorts of questions ( or at least confirming our reading ) and answering the many [P_918] posed in a matrix developed by a [P_920] group headed by wayne gardner .
the contacts i [P_91] with are andy haire and fiona yeo
i was to have gone to adl singapore next for a meeting to question them on how much of this they [P_97] to do independently without reliance on us .
so , to be awarded pioneer status , which the edb is very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion , i [P_98] need [P_99] edb demonstrate what the quantitative spin - off benefits are for singapore from our [P_914] bandwidth trading here ( e.g. increased efficiencies of capacity utilization , effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment ) .
( d ) direct [P_91] edb on ebs 's plans edb ( chelsia lim ) has this week asked ebs [P_97] her on its [P_98] for singapore .
i have made sure craig clark [P_92] the responsibility for seeing this is handled .
( a ) status of system configuration plan : the plan is done in draft and is being held pending a decision to be communicated by roger estrada within [P_99] two as to whether the lucent 10 g equipment described in the [P_915] to other equipment .
the hk lawyers ( michelle chan of clifford [P_92] ) have said that if [P_94] at the outset , we ought to just wait and send in the correct description rather than revise .
when the system configuration plan is done in final , we also [P_94] change the listed destination in the [P_96] from " san jose " to " west coast usa , [P_910] , singapore , [P_912] " .
when we know what equipment we are going to [P_93] , tom wei needs to revise the [P_96] and [P_96] in destination referred [P_99] .
my successor should [P_91] whole package once more with michelle chan in final .
someone needs [P_90] with ebs legal to get the t and c 's for media cast to michelle or to [P_97] direct channel between ebs legal and michelle chan as in the case of the exchanges on the t and c 's for bandwidth trading referred [P_916] .
( d ) [P_91] change of responsibility for ebs regulatory hk michael , or whomever will be taking over these responsibilities , should get from michelle chan of clifford [P_99] a fresh [P_911] alison lindsay 's letter to xi xi of october 2000 stating that we received our licenses and setting forth in detail all of the requirements .
- [P_90] be selecting an independent auditor to certify certain routine reports [P_95] file [P_96] .
once kim and chang starts [P_91] this , someone from regulatory [P_94] made available to [P_95] guide kim and chang on our regulatory [P_98] , in coordination with robbi rossi .
the key e - mails are ( a ) one from me outlining [P_94] problem and some [P_96] dealing with it ; ( b ) one from jan haizmann with [P_910] and in some cases alternative [P_913] to deal with it , ( c ) two from jae moo lee in korea with [P_919] points of view .
art also responds to donald and roger estrada and relies on them for [P_94] .
art has [P_90] amendment to our special type 2 license [P_93] service to other destinations .
someone needs to be assigned responsibility [P_92] the amendment through .
i admit that i agree with the approach we are taking for now [P_94] offer nothing [P_95] the immediate term .
[P_90] are going [P_91] japan one of the centerpieces of our asia ebs strategy , i [P_96] need to consider devoting more full time ebs regulatory resources [P_910] exclusively .
the allocation problem is that whatever regulatory [P_92] apply have [P_93] on immediate license amendment and operational questions that drive out time to [P_98] term issues such as how to go about amending the telecommunications business law to allow bandwidth trading explicitly .
this would seem [P_91] reduce long term risks to our business strategy .
" i had been giving intermittent support to [P_92] scott yeager and justin cornett of ebs , [P_95] reed of technology for all , figure out how to [P_99] concept of technology for all to asia .
the strategy was to [P_91] some of japan 's $ 15 billion pledge of funds to support digital divide activities [P_96] - to support [P_98] into asia of the ebs - supported tfa [P_911] .

this agency , which so far exists just on paper , [P_93] used to build power plants [P_96] run a state - owned transmission system .
with the state locking up so much of california 's [P_93] power needs , legislators openly [P_95] utility - rescue efforts are worth the billions of dollars they would require .
he credits the long - term power contracts with [P_93] cool the spot market for electricity , where prices in recent weeks have dropped sharply .
that was down from $ 243 in may , though still far above the $ 25-to-$27 [P_95] of two years ago .
but some worry about how this rush to address a short - term problem [P_94] the longer - term [P_96] .
the state has since hastily assembled a group of about 20 energy traders , headed by a 30-year - old [P_96] one year [P_98] in the energy business .
they managed [P_90] lower current power costs , he notes , although that required signing deals [P_95] force the state to " pay a little more " than it otherwise [P_910] have in the years ahead .

folks , this note is intended [P_92] all who [P_93] concerned on our [P_95] toward [P_95] a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of products .
it is our objective [P_91] derivative products [P_92] these entities to effectively hedge this exposure .
but it is [P_91] note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional .
thus , we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti - hurricane entities [P_97] regional products and the pro - hurricane entities [P_911] bundled regional products [P_914] their exposure .
the data [P_90] by year , storm , or [P_93] the u.s coastline .

i think bob 's [P_91] are frank and pertinent and i endorse them fully .
the best way to [P_91] is to ask if enw will assure that their intercompany charges will not be like those currently received from epsc ( facilities ) .
i should ask if all of you are [P_92] this .
and i [P_90] get back to you .
because networks does [P_91] all of enron , she has a [P_94] in her role to transfer dollars between networks and various other companies .
at this time , the security for the asset accountants is [P_93] by business unit and an accountant can only perform an intercompany transfer within her business unit .

my recommendation is [P_91] fully [P_92] brownsville , tx site with a plan to flip the site [P_96] have a permit , as market conditions warrant .
i recommend holding off on significant expenditures in florida until we get [P_94] with site control .

, the city council has formed a committee to study [P_93] of shielding temecula residents from similar jolts when the deregulation wave washes into riverside county in a couple of years .
we now know what [P_91] happen , [P_92] do n't want to be caught asleep .
those cities are studying [P_91] of palm springs , which in 1997 contracted with portland gas and electric to provide residents with a flat rate for electricity for five years .
naggar said the council has yet to form a committee charged with monitoring san diego gas&electric 's proposal to string [P_96] lines across huge metal towers through southwest county , to relieve san diego 's electric rate explosion .
if they decide to go down the middle of temecula , i [P_94] assure [P_94] 'll make a move .
if they decide to go through the ( santa rosa ) plateau , i [P_94] assure [P_95] 'll [P_96] .
temecula council members have been unanimously opposed to bringing new power lines through , [P_94] , the city since the project was unveiled about two months ago .
he said he 'll get [P_91] a meeting with rupert .
[P_90] to those answers , [P_92] keep in mind that market value can not necessarily be calculated with [P_96] precision .
in [P_90] the applicable indices for those two pipelines for some of the [P_94] months , it is clear that , if $ .10 or $ .11 were deducted from the index price , then the resulting price [P_913] still [P_913] as published by inside ferc .

enron 's financial woes may [P_91] be a drag on dynegy 's earnings [P_94] if the transaction [P_96] , analysts said .
enron 's bankers have met with unidentified investors , including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies , in a bid to shore up the energy trader 's finances with an injection of as much as $ 2 billion , [P_913] york times reported yesterday , citing unidentified executives close to the companies .
[P_90] to raise $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion in cash within the [P_95] 45 days , said sean egan , managing director of egan - jones rating co. ` ` their trading operation has burned through cash faster than the market had expected , ' '
enron has said fourth - quarter earnings [P_92] reduced partly by a drop in its energy - trading business .
` ` [P_90] to know enough about the ( energy ) business to know whether it 's a [P_96] deal , and then [P_98] to be [P_99] in the dynegy team , ' ' he said .
` ` they would possibly hold it for years , because they [P_94] slow exits . ' ' kkr is also a [P_97] candidate because it recently raised a new $ 5 billion buyout fund .
any lbo firm [P_91] assurance about how it will get its money back on an enron investment , said snow .
` ` if there 's a [P_92] dynegy [P_92] agree to buy out ( the lbo firms ' ) stake over time , that would give some confidence .
that means the private equity portion would have [P_92] $ 1 billion or more .
--the carlyle group [P_91] invest through a $ 1 billion energy fund it 's raising , as well as its general u.s. buyout fund , said snow .
the firm recently raised about $ 1.5 billion [P_92] investments , about one - third of what it [P_96] to raise , and has said it [P_99] on ` ` back- to - basics ' ' investments in food , manufacturing and media .

john woolfolk mercury news california 's first major power plant [P_93] than a decade [P_95] pumping badly needed electricity into the grid today , leading a new wave of generators to ease the state 's energy drought .
` ` it 's very encouraging [P_92] as the operator of the state 's grid to see [P_96] of this magnitude come online [P_98] shortfalls expected this summer , ' ' said jim detmers , vice president of grid operations at the iso .
edison plans to upgrade the plant to a [P_92] , combined - cycle [P_94] generating 585 megawatts by the summer of 2003 .
before taking significant action , however , the utilities plan more tests , and are awaiting direction from gov. gray davis , who [P_97] an announcement [P_99] week , the mercury news has learned .
they also must address the concerns of customers , [P_93] be unfamiliar with the concept and worried [P_96] damage appliances or computers .
[P_90] in [P_91] several weeks and continue into the summer as workers adjust substations statewide , turning down voltages like motorists slightly lifting their foot from the [P_910] to save fuel .
for now , supporters say , the idea is one of the more promising ways [P_95] get california through the summer .
` ` [P_90] like a [P_92] deal to me . '
most appliances are built to operate best at about 115 volts , [P_94] 110 to 130 .
` ` the utilities agreed to analyze the [P_92] results from the past several weeks and use them to determine on a circuit - by - circuit basis where [P_99] voltage conservation [P_910] occur , and then implement that conservation wherever practical , ' ' nelson said .
the puc may debate granting utilities an emergency waiver from the standards that [P_94] allow some homes -- particularly in outlying areas at the end of long circuits where voltage tends to drop off slightly -- to receive power as low as 110 volts temporarily , he said .
` ` as long as we keep the voltages above 114 , [P_94] do that .
` ` we [P_91] for every [P_92] squeeze more megawatts from the system . ' '
the tests showed that small [P_91] in voltage would not damage the appliances [P_94] ` ` give the governor the equivalent of a new power plant or two so he [P_910] play poker [P_911] power suppliers , ' ' wattenburg said earlier this month .

[P_90] . 5 - 7621 [P_93] questions .
while i [P_90] should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone , i nonetheless thought [P_96] some [P_97] set forth a few preliminary focal points for [P_911] , [P_912] you do n't get to [P_914] a [P_915] .
i thought it made sense to contemporaneously record [P_92] as i [P_94] of the issues / positions .
also , i 'll have to run down the conflict issue when i [P_94] into [P_95] , but i thought i could generally [P_98] ppa in any [P_910] .
[P_90] , i did not know whether it was ena 's or dynegy 's obligation [P_95] on a response to cms , but i thought it made some sense [P_910] what one [P_911] on paper .
as noted [P_90] , there are [P_92] underlying this position .
while many of [P_91] computations are done on a [P_93] year basis -- which generally supports mplp 's position -- the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a [P_910] basis results in two anomalies : namely , the stated capacity charge ( on exhibit d ) for " year 1 " only would [P_919] 3 months , but even more importantly , the capacity charge ( [P_920] d ) for " year 35 " would [P_920] the last 21 months of the contract term .
my overall concern is that an arbitrator may [P_92] the anomaly ( described above ) that results by applying exhibit d using a [P_98] concept ( i.e. , the 21 month " year 35 " issue ) since that is a fairly easy concept to get [P_916] ..
[P_90] a definitive conclusion on the issue [P_92] made , we likely [P_94] to review or undertake , as the case [P_98] be , [P_99] such as ( which i [P_911] generally obtain from the michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e - mail you forwarded ) : --the michigan puc presumably approved the ppa ( prior to the first amendment ) in a published order .
( [P_90] particularly [P_91] try to settle out the dispute on the basis that mplp would concede the issue on a prospective basis only ) .
certain points in support of mplp 's position --the definition of " contract capacity factor " provides for a [P_96] determination and , most importantly , provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the cod occurs that ends at the end of that [P_916] .
( [P_90] the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments [P_95] if [P_96] be [P_97] that respect ) .

in [P_90] , the newly released may [P_92] the governor 's budget submission confirms the substantial revenue deterioration that is expected to emerge over [P_98] eighteen months due to the weak [P_911] sector and stock market .
[P_90] commences what is likely to [P_92] a difficult budget debate .
to date , the state 's general fund cash advances for power purchases total approximately $ 4 billion , and these advances are likely to grow very quickly in [P_99] months .
moody 's estimates that the state 's ending cash position will be approximately $ 10 billion at june 30 , 2001 , including both general fund cash and internal " borrowable resources " , which represents cash [P_912] be borrowed by the general fund beyond the end of the fiscal year .
as a result , the state 's cash reserves are likely to [P_94] depleted by the time long - term financing [P_97] secured .
[P_90] of the early 1990s indicates that a substantial portion of borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity .
we are currently assuming the state 's general fund [P_93] not be fully reimbursed by the proceeds of the long - term financing , as such full reimbursement would reduce the amount of bond proceeds [P_911] power purchases , and require dwr to seek [P_915] rate increases during 2001 .
based primarily on the downturn in the high technology sector , which relies heavily on options in compensation packages , and the sluggish performance of the stock market and its adverse affect on capital gains , the state has reduced its tax revenue [P_914] year by approximately $ 5.4 billion , including a $ 2.7 downward revision in the personal income tax .
the drop in these sources of income [P_92] also temper growth in sales tax collections for [P_95] year .
the proposed budgetary reductions , along with proposed spending levels for recurring items such as education , [P_95] lead to prolonged budget debate in the [P_98] .
while such budget negotiations would not necessarily [P_92] the timing of the issuance of the long - term power bonds , delay could [P_98] weaken the state 's fiscal position .
the energy crisis will have economic , as well as financial , consequences that [P_94] uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook .
in moody 's view , the forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate the [P_95] of [P_96] dimensions of the energy crisis .
at the moment , [P_91] that the substantial cash resources accumulated by the state of california during the [P_96] the last decade , in combination with the planned long - term energy financing will [P_912] it to avert the degree of fiscal damage [P_915] call for the rating to fall to the a range .
while [P_90] that the state will [P_92] a viable long - term energy financing over [P_96] few months , substantial obstacles must be overcome to meet that goal .

blockbuster has been picking up market share and growing the business , " mr. karmazin said , adding that viacom was " very [P_97] prospects .
viacom 's change of mind is likely to spark speculation that the [P_94] to buy the 17.7 % of blockbuster stock outstanding that is in the public 's hands , to [P_911] to tap the cash now being generated by the chain .
when viacom originally acquired the business in 1994 , it hoped [P_93] be a cash cow that [P_96] pay for the paramount communications acquisition that year .
blockbuster has [P_90] to grab market share , reflecting fading competition from other chains and independent stores .
at the time viacom planned to unload within about a year of [P_94] its remaining blockbuster holding by offering viacom shareholders a [P_97] exchange their shares for stock in the video - rental unit .
business is so strong that blockbuster now is having to deal with a [P_94] problem : long check - out lines at stores , where in some cases customers have had to wait for 45 minutes .
but mr. wood has said he believes that the agency needs to [P_94] to ensure well - functioning energy markets in california and other places or risk [P_99] deregulation fail entirely . '
he also received $ 7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as [P_94] 782,830 shares that [P_96] be [P_96] at $ 35 million if enron 's stock [P_99] 10 percent annually .
u.s.-based enron corp on wednesday presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) fired power plant in northern [P_97] , aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant [P_911] .
the [P_90] brings enron one step [P_92] to realising its plan to [P_94] a power plant with an initial capacity of two million kilowatts in aomori prefecture .

according to the plan , [P_91] plans to build a gas - turbine combined cycle power plant with [P_96] capacity of 2,000 megawatts in the mutsu ogawara industrial area in aomori in the northern part of japan 's main island .
[P_90] scheduled to [P_91] 2004 , following an environmental assessment [P_94] from relevant authorities , for commercial operation in 2007 or later .

the proposed [P_90] also [P_91] lure enterprises of various kinds to [P_94] operations in the area , kimura said in a statement .
encom is considering other sites [P_91] on which it [P_93] build large - scale power plants .
since japan [P_90] retail power market for large - lot high - volume industrial and commercial users - which represent roughly 30 % of total power demand - to free competition in march 2000 , a number of [P_913] entrants have been tapping into the country 's y15 trillion industry .

the company has proposed [P_91] an initial investment of $ 2 million in the new subsidiary [P_95] be increased subsequently .
the company has an installed wind power generator adjacent to its dabhol project in maharashtra which has been continuously gauging the nature of wind and [P_98] of using wind as a perennial source of power in the country .
according to the company 's official website , the western coast of the country has been identified as a [P_96] area of proposed [P_97] .
however , the site map does not [P_92] the exact location of [P_95] .

skilling said he expected demand pressure to keep natural gas prices high for several years until demand [P_95] be curbed [P_96] production be brought into play , possibly by increasing the import of liquefied natural gas .
building [P_90] liquefied gas , storing it and returning it to gaseous [P_95] burning would be expensive [P_97] as long as natural gas prices remain above $ 3.50 per thousand cubic feet , he said .
he also received $ 7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as [P_94] 782,830 shares [P_95] be [P_96] at $ 35 million if enron 's stock [P_99] 10 percent annually over the life of [P_912] .

i realize the group [P_91] go a different way [P_93] , but i remain convinced that [P_95] go to a pure number system ( ie a pure relative ranking ) and use the behaviors [P_912] descriptions as a way of discussing the differences between people .
the relative ranking lets us have the flexibility to meet [P_93] by getting tighter or " looser " [P_96] rankings , terminations , and comp .

according to prepared remarks for a speech to be delivered at a central banking conference at the bank of italy in rome , clementi said [P_98] recording transactions in derivatives markets also needs to be [P_912] to avert wider shocks in financial markets .
but these same customers [P_91] take on further exposure to other forms of credit [P_95] new [P_96] without increasing their borrowing .
he is also worried about how courts [P_92] countries [P_93] treat these contracts .
by andrea reierson consolidation in the global banking sector [P_93] it harder to keep swaps the preserve of the otc marketplace and may push them onto a centralised exchange , the bank for international settlements ( bis ) said in its quarterly review .
this increasing concentration of swap books [P_92] spark strong pressure [P_93] listed on an organised exchange where counterparty risk is taken by the exchange 's clearing house , bis said .
bis also noted the market shift in fixed income benchmarks from government bonds to [P_94] - term [P_95] , particularly in the us .
trading in [P_90] swaps has risen relative to futures and options trading in treasury [P_95] bonds with transactions in coupon - bearing us treasuries peaking in 1998 while those in private instruments continue to rise , the bis said .
the continued [P_90] the [P_91] swaps market also underpinned demand for money market products , typically the most common hedging vehicle [P_97] and swaptions .
nevertheless , though the effects of these excesses are likely to continue for much of this year in the form of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings [P_99] of [P_910] banks , these problems , one hopes , will prove modest both by historical standards and relative to the resources of these institutions .
responses to a request for comment related to [P_92] basel accord and an alternative proposal by the fed [P_96] capital standards for u.s. banks show that most banks [P_910] basel accord , he said .
i should emphasize that we are still analyzing your many [P_93] determine what kind of response [P_96] give .
the possibility of creating a single ' master master ' agreement that covers both physical and financial products was actively discussed , with advocates citing such contracts would [P_99] efficiency by simplifying the negotiation [P_911] market operators .
doubts were expressed by some participants , however , regarding [P_93] a ' master master ' contract , especially concerning administration , legal and negotiation [P_99] cross - affiliate master agreements .
few of the contracts introduced by established marketplaces in recent years have met with an [P_95] response , and the gains [P_97] by some contracts have largely reflected a reallocation of business away from traditional benchmarks , " said bis economist serge jeanneau in the international body 's quarterly review .
a reallocation of activity also took place in europe in the late 1990s , with eurex capturing business in the long - term segment of the euro yield curve and liffe achieving dominance in [P_911] - term area , " said janneau in the report .
janneau believes the falling number of non - government issues in [P_93] to exchanges introducing contracts based on corporate and asset - backed securities .
examples of likely [P_91] behaviour include the us bond market association 's move last september [P_95] proposals for a corporate bond futures contract , and cbot 's efforts [P_99] mortgage - backed contracts .

we have two strategies that [P_91] suggest : 1 .

this would call [P_91] to [P_92] generation , and the energy [P_94] - back in the real - time [P_97] be used to [P_99] prescheduled quantity .
as in the previous example , if [P_92] to generate is $ 40 , and you sell day - ahead for $ 50 , you make $ 10/mwh .
[P_90] can buy - back the energy for a price of $ 30 , then [P_95] $ 20/mwh .
[P_90] know exactly when and for how long the [P_93] be down or reduced .
also , the settlements statements [P_91] to [P_93] .

before considering [P_90] landscape , it is worth [P_93] various phases of the market during the [P_96] years .
nevertheless , despite the lack of highly leveraged structures , companies throughout the region continued to fund long - term local currency investments with [P_98] term foreign currency (
corporate credit quality is slowly [P_91] and a recent trend has been the increasing use of derivatives by financial institutions - particularly local banks and fund managers .
this is expected to continue as [P_92] leads to a [P_94] yield enhancement and credit risk management .
the emergence of domestic bond markets is having a positive [P_93] market [P_94] , both directly and indirectly .
there is a direct impact where [P_92] are swapped into a different currency ( in the case of foreign issuers accessing a market ) , or [P_99] rate ( where issuers [P_910] alter the [P_912] basis ) .
additionally , the increased availability of instruments in the market [P_93] demand [P_94] from investors is leading to new local currency products , such as options on domestic interest rates and securities .
this in turn requires [P_91] regulatory consideration , which has generally been in line with international standards .
[P_90] , it is reasonable [P_92] a mend towards regulatory harmonization [P_94] adoption of international regulatory standards .
there has been continual [P_91] as the number of users increases , more products become [P_95] regulations put in place to allow healthy market development .
nevertheless , the derivatives markets in asia [P_92] and [P_94] as end - users grow in number and sophistication , while [P_98] of products continues [P_99] .
but with the forthcoming fourth financial markets enhancement act there [P_93] light at the end of the tunnel .
it is , however , widely expected - or at least [P_93] - that the forthcoming fourth financial markets enhancement act will include the introduction of a statutory definition of borsentermingeschafte .
its conceptual scope is controvasial3 and the continuous [P_92] new types of transactions requires a provision which is as comprehensive [P_97] .
but the meager contribution provided by equity markets masked an [P_93] 28 per cent increase on volumes from levels last year , and a 14 per cent increase in exchange traded options .
use of [P_90] rate agreements more than doubled during the year to $ 1 trillion making it the fastest growing market segment for the year .
` ` the [P_91] market was more volatile this year than last and that means there was greater underlying customer demand for [P_97] rate hedging , ' ' said mr. farrow .
` ` the market has [P_91] considerably .
bankers who have worked [P_91] the basle committee on banking supervision say it is likely to [P_95] three different [P_96] banking supervisors : basic indicators ( that is , a single proxy for the entire bank , such as trading volumes ) ; a business line approach using committee - imposed capital ratio ; or thirdly , internal measurement using a bank 's own loss data within a supervisory specified [P_920] .
the implication is [P_91] and [P_92] the internal measurement approach [P_94] result an [P_95] of appropriate models and a fourth regulatory option , based on internal modelling .
the principal message to regulators is that larger banks [P_93] operational risk measurement and management should achieve lower capital charges .
joseph sabitini , managing director in the corporate risk management group at jp morgan in [P_95] , recognises that a [P_97] for operational risk must accommodate banks at all levels of sophistication in terms of risk measurement and management , but that it also includes a risk - based option for " those with the appropriate [P_919] " .
stages three and four [P_91] to using technology for the measurement and management of those risks within a firm .
we have also looked at a number of quantification techniques , [P_93] their effectiveness [P_95] on the quality and quantity of [P_97] available .
according to tony peccia , vice - president in [P_93] risk management division at cibc world markets in toronto , most banks [P_97] the internal measurement [P_910] the proposed capital charge when implemented - which [P_913] on internal data .
the more consortium has agreed to begin sharing data from november 1 2000 and receive the first [P_95] scrubbed , anonymous data by the end of the year .
the paper highlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach [P_93] enable institutions with poor operational risk management [P_95] controls , but with access to internal loss event data , to achieve a lower capital charge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but no access to internal loss [P_916] data .
the paper also highlights fears over the method of calculation of [P_93] an institution that has recently experienced serious loss , but where [P_98] reacted and strengthened the control environment in [P_911] , and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence .
the paper argues blat there is strong [P_92] the industry for a regulatory capital assessment model that allows institutions managing [P_97] to effectively access a more precise means of calculating an [P_911] capital charge - institutions should [P_913] more sophisticated controls and the regulatory regime should establish incentives to [P_917] risk management and controls .
insurance and risk transfer will become [P_92] and sophisticated component in an [P_94] manager 's tool - box over [P_97] few years .
although some products on the market [P_92] immediate liquidity to a bank following a disaster , there [P_96] certain arguments after [P_97] .
rachlin also highlights reputational issues : " while insurance [P_93] cover [P_93] - term financial [P_95] events the [P_97] reputation [P_98] of greater concern .
insurance will play a role as an instrument for managing [P_93] , but not in its current form .... we are waiting for the regulators .
victor dowd , an associate involved with operational risk capital charge [P_93] the uk 's financial services authority agrees [P_96] and [P_97] the internal measurement approach may result in [P_911] of appropriate models .

( paul is scheduled to speak to us [P_92] a decision .
[P_90] remember in the beginning of [P_92] we discussed piloting autonomy or an unstructured data management [P_96] in order to reach qualitative and quantitative information .
further , we discussed the value [P_92] a product [P_93] identify experts [P_95] .
however , only 50 % of those interviewed suggested they would tag [P_94] others to [P_95] regardless if [P_96] identify experts .
but , over 90 % of those surveyed agreed an enterprise [P_93] would [P_94] .
autonomy provides some feature / functionality to search email ( the full extent of [P_94] be [P_95] by the sst ) .
are we prepared to invest in a much more expensive search engine with categorization feature / functionality [P_95] provide a more robust [P_97] platform of the [P_99] or should we decide to invest in the best value for our current needs ?
this distinction was arrived at [P_91] the characteristics described in the charter and associated survey as to what was meant by an unstructured data management [P_98] .
to stay within the time frame of the overall project , the scope of the [P_95] evaluation [P_96] on these three vendors .

enron officials spoke of the water business in much the same way they now talk about broadband : it 's a fragmented international market worth $ 300 billion a year , and enron could extend its [P_912] to [P_912] and win a huge share of that market .
` ` i think our legacy [P_92] that we proved [P_93] build a business on intellectual capital , not physical assets . ' ' a self - described business history buff , skilling argues that the era of corporate [P_913] based on gathering assets is over .

[P_90] is the proposed arbitration demand in the above - referenced action .
[P_90] for all coming in this morning -
dear phillip , [P_91] account has been activated in [P_93] management system .
michael , attached [P_91] review and comment , the on - line user agreement [P_95] application [P_96] discussed this morning .
lynn , i have no problem with shirley , however , since she has began [P_95] home , i have had limited interaction with her due to [P_99] schedules .
therefore , if it is at all [P_92] choose someone else from the team that i [P_95] , i [P_97] it .
but i [P_90] you before i go to [P_93] anything .
[P_90] reports [P_91] our client link website .
[P_90] manhattan office reits - [P_92] as much as 25 million sqft of downtown office impacted - companies with major office exposure in nyc brookfield properties has the most significant downtown office exposure ; boston properties , equity office , sl green and vornado have most assets in midtown .
- suburban office [P_91] see increased demand reckson and mack - cali have the most [P_95] york metro suburban office exposure ; consequently our rating on cli is under review .
it is logical [P_91] that new york domicile companies will have higher exposure .
- we are waiting on [P_91] information before adjusting estimates industry fundamentals will likely come under pressure , and estimates will fall materially for several companies .
the housing markets [P_91] secular drivers [P_92] withstand [P_93] of the wtc attack on consumer confidence or economic growth .
- patience [P_90] required in the credit card sector while we 're encouraged by the slowdown in consumer credit growth , we [P_98] it is too early [P_99] on a turn in the credit cycle .
- providing some [P_91] this week 's tragedy [P_93] are still [P_94] , but in [P_95] - term [P_97] reduced capacity and higher volatility in [P_99] sector .
- [P_90] - term tug of war is likely key issues are the unsettled global markets , partially offset by [P_96] central bank liquidity .
separately , infrastructure and [P_91] things " choppy " at best .
[P_90] so , but we acknowledge a backlash towards global connectivity [P_94] slow capital flows , [P_95] , and consolidation .
- strong companies will recoup losses through higher rates being adequately capitalized , companies with strong claims - paying ratings [P_96] well - [P_98] write profitable business at much higher rates in 2002 .
- [P_90] try not to overreact when the [P_93] , [P_94] not sell into panic , and for stocks that you otherwise [P_98] own , [P_99] weakness .
[P_90] ourselves for [P_91] outcomes , we conducted a valuation sensitivity analysis showing what levels the stocks [P_96] considered oversold , fairly valued , and over valued .
with little move , we 'd [P_92] sellers .
electric utilities / unregulated power defensive ports in a storm - electric power stocks should benefit from ' flight to quality ' [P_97] regulated and unregulated / integrated groups to perform well relative to the market when trading resumes , as investors [P_914] into defensive stocks .

for [P_90] term we see incremental risk for the september quarter since software companies tend [P_95] most of the deals in the last ten days of the quarter .
longer term , these events underscore the need for backup and recovery software and veritas [P_95] over time as well as oracle who 's database [P_99] in features for replication and hot backup capabilities ( in conjunction with veritas ) .
reliability and recovery issues will [P_91] important items on the checklist [P_94] consulting services .
- oracle will [P_91] with its earnings release this evening after the close of the market .

* as [P_90] business signals are mixed and stocks remain volatile , we 're taking a 12 month view that trends for ems in 02 will be [P_99] significantly .

[P_90] that the spx and ndx [P_92] a [P_93] interest rate cuts .
while we believe the company continues to effectively manage its business and have a high level of confidence in ceo paul charron , we recognize that the uncertainty in senior management is unsettling and believe [P_911] of the situation [P_913] a [P_914] for the shares .

these are not [P_91] solutions , but they are the best i can think of , especially given that the ag [P_97] roll out softs products on eol in [P_910] couple of months or so .
; i [P_90] analysis is well - reasoned .
[P_90] , i can not find a definition of agricultural commodity , although the term is used elsewhere , see sec .
for those transactions [P_91] be traded with eligible commercial entities on [P_94] trading facility under subsection ( 3 ) , there is a notice requirement .
therefore if enron wishes to conduct such business , a [P_93] way to raise the issue with the cftc [P_96] such a notice and then [P_99] to the staff for prior review .
absent a cftc regulation , [P_91] not come for [P_93] , the [P_94] to deal with the issue as definitively [P_97] to raise it with the staff directly .

i do agree that [P_91] to put some protocols in [P_93] regard [P_94] enron handles different levels of confidential information ( including trade secrets ) .
for example , trading positions and [P_92] would have one standard for access and disclosure , while personnel [P_96] have a different one .
the [P_90] is that [P_92] set the guidelines [P_94] on a periodic basis [P_96] that they are followed , rather than create updated inventories .
i would not view this type of approach as requiring much , if any , [P_95] outside counsel .

[P_90] delay confirms market 's suspicions [P_92] shippers on [P_93] chicago - to - dawn vector pipeline had their fears confirmed tuesday when pipeline officials announced that [P_99] - up date for [P_911] , which was scheduled for nov. 1 to [P_914] - up of the long - awaited [P_918] , [P_919] delayed until dec. 1 .
[P_90] officials blamed [P_91] on the excessive rainfall that has hampered construction of the pipeline , which --- [P_96] --- [P_97] initial takeaway for about 700 mmcf / d of the 1.3 bcf / d of western canadian gas that will [P_914] to the chicago market by alliance .

shippers were notified of [P_91] along with the rest of the market tuesday , although many already had suspected the pipeline would n't [P_98] to adhere to its scheduled [P_910] - up date .
the dec. 1 [P_91] - up date includes adequate time for [P_93] weather impacts and for the extensive commissioning and [P_97] programs necessary , it said , adding vector is scheduled to begin filling the system in late october to complete the commissioning of facilities .

at the time , we were going to shut down the qf and pay them more pv than they would have gotten by running , the " grease " coming from [P_910] high o&m , which [P_912] extinguished with the proposed structure .

i am sure [P_91] at length at [P_93] intrastate pipeline association meeting on june 22 ( to be hosted by redmond at enron's / hpl 's offices ) .
if [P_90] passes , [P_91] have one [P_93] year to apply for a voluntary emissions reduction permit ( verp ) .
note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly cindy morphew of txoga and celina romero of atingp - that [P_98] as though [P_99] get an [P_910] get these facilities permitted without having to use today 's bact .
if that attempt is successful , [P_92] to apply for a verp [P_94] gone on september 1 .
i am not certain how long [P_92] to exist .
in [P_90] , i 've appended [P_92] on 10-year old bact for gas - fired ic engines and turbines [P_96] if you are trying to get a verp now .
if while processing the application , the commission determines that [P_93] information is necessary [P_94] or to take final action on the application , the commission [P_99] the information and set a reasonable deadline for a response .
the commission [P_90] issue an existing facility [P_92] some or all of the grandfathered [P_95] a site .
the commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate [P_96] required than in other areas , but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate [P_913] be required in any area .
because control technology for nox emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is [P_94] , it is doubtful if significant control [P_97] be achieved through the permit system at this time .
i believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the trncc [P_95] to [P_96] of guidelines for 10-year bact for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the verp program .
grandfathered engines and turbines that [P_91] to be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram [P_95] will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review .
grandfathered engines and turbines that are not [P_92] be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram [P_95] be permittable under a verp [P_98] data to validate the old ( pre - modification ) [P_912] ( post - modification ) emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions [P_918] achieved .
also needed [P_90] a representation of the cost of the controls and even though [P_95] modifications [P_95] , [P_96] cost is prohibitive .
i [P_90] all of this is [P_92] .
[P_90] need [P_91] .
, you asked for an example of what [P_92] consider " [P_94] emission reductions " that [P_95] acceptable in a case - by - case review when the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level [P_913] not be achieved .
also needed in the case - by - case review [P_93] a representation of what the cost of the controls [P_97] with a discussion of why the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level [P_913] not be achieved .
[P_90] be due [P_91] limitations such as no [P_93] controls or modifications [P_94] , [P_95] may identify cost in dollars per [P_98] nox controlled to show that even though [P_911] modifications are available , the cost is prohibitive .
after my first read , [P_91] .
at that time older rich burn engines [P_92] been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g / hp - hr limit for nox .
the 10 year old bact review on these engines and turbines will have to be done on a case - by - case basis just as [P_98] have done 10 years ago .
we [P_90] this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they [P_94] either exempt or permit under the verp program and submit their letters of intent to participate in the verp program by december 7 , 2000 .
for each engine or turbine , [P_92] a , table 29 or 31 as applicable , and other [P_96] information that will support the standard exemption claim .
for engines that will be authorized by a verp permit , please identify each engine by unit number , epn , air quality account number , and plant name , [P_910] of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a result of participation in the verp program .
when the verp [P_91] are submitted , information [P_92] provided to show that nox emissions [P_95] in the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr range .
information showing that actual emissions reductions [P_92] achieved , even when the targeted [P_94] 2 to 8 g / hp - hr can not [P_98] , [P_99] staff review of the application .

a controversial issue in these proceedings has been whether the costs of transco 's twelve incrementally - priced [P_96] and southern expansion [P_97] rolled into transco 's system - wide rates .
the 1999 policy statement , however , has a threshold requirement for [P_94] requiring that there [P_95] no subsidization [P_97] customers - in other words , no increase in costs of [P_911] .
the pgt order found that there was a [P_92] fuel costs [P_94] increase for existing shippers ; therefore , pgt had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject [P_99] shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that would apply absent [P_915] .

[P_90] recall at the wspp meeting in colorado i asked mike small if he [P_95] n't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups .
i [P_90] to get your take on the following kind of big picture enron policy on wspp approach .
every amendment that has been made in the past two years [P_93] agreements [P_94] and [P_95] into alignment and it is preposterous [P_97] serious lawyer to argue that we [P_910] off with two agreements , one that is almost like the other one .
the wspp should be focusing on more boondoggles and more [P_93] work like [P_94] for rto west , dealing with the emerging california changes , and open access in oregon and nevada .
therefore , this policy would let our marketers praise the wspp for being a [P_94] organization , but at the same time , advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to [P_913] projects .
rosman [P_90] : enron loves the wspp , it has done a [P_94] with the contract reformation , that task is done , we now should [P_99] to bigger and [P_911] tasks .

there have been [P_91] to accounting standards [P_92] which , by the time they have all been implemented will have brought japanese accounting standards broadly into line with international norms .

ifr - november 17 , 2001 standard documentation aimed at clarifying which company should serve as reference entity for [P_96] swaps in [P_97] of a demerger or other structural change , such as a consolidation , [P_912] put [P_913] by the international swaps [P_915] association this week .
while the successor issue has been debated since the break - up of national power of the uk , the imminent break - ups of at&t and bt into smaller entities has underscored the [P_911] for [P_912] documentation .
no successor [P_90] appointed if the original reference entity continues to exist .
it came almost exactly a year after a similar decision by the most active [P_94] dealers to drop restructuring as a standard credit [P_98] us corporate default swaps .
[P_90] definition was agreed at the end of april and released in [P_94] , but liquidity in the default swap market was hit in the early months of the year by the uncertainty caused by the debate .
the issue of obligation acceleration had not been a [P_93] concern for dealers until moody 's indicated that it was uncomfortable with the inclusion of what it viewed as a " soft " credit event in the default swaps that back credit - linked notes and collateralised debt obligations .
[P_90] trigger exercise on a default swap , when there was still a [P_94] the covenant [P_96] made whole before the fundamental default event - failure [P_99] a debt payment - had taken place .
derivatives dealing heads in [P_91] echo this sentiment and point out that buyers of [P_95] will still [P_96] to request that obligation acceleration is included as a feature in a swap .
the international [P_90] derivatives association last week announced plans [P_93] fpml.org , a non - profit industry body dedicated to [P_97] a business information exchange standard for electronic dealing and processing of financial derivative transactions .
in theory , liquidity [P_91] receive a boost from a move to greater automation .
for smaller end users it means that there is less [P_93] involved in entering into a transaction , " said lynn .
no decision on linking fpml 's transaction standards with isda [P_93] has been made yet , but such a move is [P_98] .
[P_90] forces with isda [P_91] raise [P_92] of fpml , but awareness of its [P_95] is not a problem said lynn .
fpml.org 's architectural [P_91] group , and its [P_92] covering interest rate , foreign exchange and equity derivatives , [P_96] to exist as sub - groups of isda 's new fpml committee .
isda 's fpml committee will retain responsibility for approving [P_93] versions of the standard .
fpml standards currently exist for [P_91] derivative products [P_93] rate agreements .

enron once [P_90] trading unit -- which at one point accounted for more than 90 % of its revenue -- would fetch nearly $ 1 billion in an auction , with enron retaining an equity stake in the revival .

as we discussed earlier [P_91] taken [P_92] two [P_93] fields in our financial confirmations .
[P_90] these written financial confirmations the normal back office procedures [P_95] apply to their issuance , and thus this requirement should not [P_99] direct [P_910] on the on line systems .
it does however introduce a requirement [P_92] a change to [P_93] to [P_95] place [P_96] the first on line transactions in september .
i believe there are different [P_91] in [P_92] financial businesses .
i suggest that the two [P_91] fields required in the financial confirmations are included under the section outlining the general terms of [P_97] .
if different to 1 , insert country in which [P_93] through which the counterparty [P_95] payment is located >
once [P_90] are established ( and also for existing customer base - would this [P_95] a [P_95] way of approaching dealing with the existing customer [P_98] the aim of eliminating annex a which are different only because of the tax reps ? )
perhaps a [P_90] way of maintaining this data would be to set it up on a spreadsheet [ or the counterparty database ? ]
thus the decision on which countries to insert would only need to be made once [P_95] up a [P_96] .
for example [P_90] like this : counterparty description counterparty payor jurisdiction counterparty payee jurisdiction
the responses to the 3 legal information requirements set out on [P_93] customer [P_94] [ [P_95] link directly to the counterparty payor jurisdiction and the counterparty payee jurisdiction fields on the relevant financial confirmation ] or [ should [P_913] into the counterparty database ] or [ should be entered into [P_917] for maintaing tax representation
[ the onus is on the customer to identify errors , [P_93] should probably act in good faith in [P_96] to identify obvious errors].

sme lenders ' initial concerns included the steepness of basel 's credit risk weighting [P_94] the internal ratings - based ( irb ) approach , its insistence that expected loss provisions [P_910] made [P_911] to typical unexpected loss provisions , confusion over which sme loans [P_916] included under the retail approach , and the extent to which physical collateral [P_920] used as a risk mitigant .
the basel committee has since issued a paper , ' potential modifications to the committee 's proposals ' , which outlines current thinking within the committee and indicates that [P_99] key concessions to sme lenders .
we have got very long maturities , [P_92] put german banks at [P_94] competitive disadvantage compared with other countries , " says winkler .
what kills a bank is deterioration of value , and it has got to [P_94] a lot of things on the books , so you ca n't [P_99] final default , " said a basel committee member .
he said his hands were all but tied on the maturity debate , and confirmed that the german side [P_96] prepared to scupper basel ii 's timetable should a deal fail to [P_911] .
i have [P_90] imagining that [P_91] introduce basel ii in europe and not have a level playing field on a g-10 basis .
while hofmann said the matter was " very serious " , he remained [P_94] all sides [P_95] reach a solution .
asked if the us [P_91] agree such a concession , he added , " i could n't say that [P_96] , but [P_98] the whole package .
another area of [P_91] compromise is to allow banks with loan maturities of less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment , while banks with loans of more than three years would be capped at the three - year level - as factored into the current proposed standardised credit approach .
how big will the [P_91] rate effect be on smes ?
the paper proposes that a function based on the relationship between asset correlation and [P_94] should [P_95] to the irb risk - weight [P_98] methodology based on the relationship between asset correlation and [P_911] default .
retail businesses and wholesale businesses [P_91] similar turnover , but the characteristics and the way [P_95] manage them in risk terms [P_97] quite different , " says colin jennings , senior manager , non - retail related risk at lloyds tsb , the uk 's third largest bank .
the committee believes banks should put aside [P_92] expected losses [P_93] to the current practice of making capital charges against unexpected losses - credit risk .
we fear that [P_91] lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for german banks because of tax regulations , so we are [P_97] against covering expected losses with regulatory capital .
[P_90] to use isda resources [P_92] speed up the implementation of version 2.0 and [P_96] of version 3.0 , ' he says . '

strain robert pickel , isda 's chief executive officer , says the merger [P_94] members of fpml [P_96] on [P_97] development .
we envision adding [P_91] staff , [P_92] to find the extra funding needed through due - based revenues ' says pickel .
creating fpml is [P_91] as the isda [P_92] agreement , because it will strengthen the [P_95] the swap negotiation .
brickell says blackbird was the first company to offer fpml confirmations to its customers , and he believes isda [P_96] accelerate the adoption of 2.0 and [P_98] fpml [P_99] cover more kinds of transactions [P_911] .

leading european and us banks [P_91] how new rules [P_94] adequacy will operate , raising the possibility that final proposals from the basle committee [P_99] delayed .
they are also asking for [P_91] on the way operational risk - unexpected losses - will be treated , and [P_97] on aspects of securitisation , counterparty risk and disclosure .
the letter points out that in a number [P_92] areas the basle committee 's second consultation document has either come up [P_97] proposals or indicated that final proposals are to come .
" taken [P_90] these greener areas [P_92] a critical [P_93] the outcome of the proposals for individual firms and the industry as a whole , " the letter says .
we [P_90] concerned that if the calibration is not done properly , that will go up and it [P_96] a serious effect on the economy , " the european banking federation said .

while [P_90] is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk management and regulatory oversight of highly leveraged institutions ( hli ) , credit providers [P_98] make [P_99] the measurement of credit exposures , a global banking watchdog said friday .
although a separate study [P_91] to set out a basis [P_93] in public disclosure of financial risks has [P_96] , actual [P_98] introducing mandatory public disclosure requirements for hlis and hedge funds has been limited , the fsf report said .
at the same time , [P_91] have been made by senior management in terms of reporting on hli exposures , general standards of credit analysis , due [P_99] , the fsf reported .
and foreign exchange market [P_91] agreed to a set of so - called [P_94] practice guidelines for foreign exchange trading .
[P_90] address concerns that large and concentrated hli positions [P_93] the [P_94] materially influence market dynamics in [P_97] medium - [P_98] open economies , according to the fsf report .
while [P_90] is being made in addressing weaknesses in legal documentation practices , it has proven difficult to achieve [P_96] in the consistency , where appropriate , between different industry standards , the report added .
while [P_90] is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk , management and regulatory oversight of so - called highly leveraged institutions ( hlis ) , credit providers [P_910] make [P_911] the measurement of credit exposures , the global banking watchdog said .
disclosure of information by hlis to banks and other credit providers has [P_94] in terms of both quality and quantity , the bank for international settlements said last week .
the banks said they feared the legislation would discourage international investors from trading in [P_94] shares , undermining the sar 's position as an international market .
however , they [P_91] to do so under [P_93] law as it expands the disclosure requirement from shares to include derivatives .
the stricter disclosure requirement [ in the bill compared with ] international practices would [P_94] for [P_95] to reduce manipulation activities , " she said .
[P_90] the netting provisions [P_91] a wider [P_92] otc products has been a priority for the international swaps and derivatives association and the bond market association ( bma ) since the mid1990s .
in two high - profile reports in 1999 by the president 's working group - one on long - term capital management and one on otc derivatives regulation - us regulators acknowledged that [P_911] netting law would reduce systemic risk .
the definition of swaps has been stretched to cover [P_93] rate agreements , [P_94] foreign exchange contracts and other instruments .
friction developed between [P_91] and securities contracts with regard to netting across them , " says dan cunningham , a [P_97] allen & overy in [P_99] and isda 's legal counsel .
[P_90] have expanded collateral and an array of products [P_93] for safe harbour " netting and settlement will be much [P_97] under [P_99] bill , he adds .
the organizations sought the overturn of a decision rendered late last year in the u.s. district court for the southern district of [P_97] .
the three groups contended that because a wide [P_92] affect the market price of a futures contract , the imposition of ' " any continuing duty to furnish all price information and [P_911] all facts [P_913] the market price [P_915] so burdensome as to be unreasonable .
the narrow scope of a broker 's duty to a nondiscretionary account [P_94] applies fully to a futures broker , the groups wrote .
the eurobond market was a response to a [P_92] withholding tax on [P_94] payments to overseas investors in dollar bonds .
at the [P_90] 2000 , outstanding otc derivatives amounted to $ 2,800bn according to the bank for international settlements , or just over half the value of [P_99] international debt securities .
[P_90] there be a limit to the efficiency gains that [P_93] be wrung from the global financial system through innovation ?
[P_90] such as credit derivatives are growing fast , although central bankers worry about their robustness in a downturn .
while portfolio regulations for private pensions will encourage regulatory arbitrage [P_93] derivatives , the [P_94] for innovation is less obvious than [P_97] to floating exchange rates and financial liberalisation .
but only a visceral optimist [P_91] assume that financial innovation [P_93] at the pace of the past quarter - century .
airlines , especially those concentrated in a particular hub , [P_93] weather derivatives more actively since inclement weather can [P_96] many more delays than they are used to , [P_910] claudio ribeiro , head of [P_912] , weather risk management group , enron .
the way to [P_91] is by entering into [P_93] options with limits .
weather has n't presented itself to - date to be sufficiently fungible [P_94] to build a broad market on , yet it 's a pretty big market nonetheless , " adds robert levin , senior vice - president , [P_913] control [P_914] , at [P_915] exchange .
since september 1997 , when the first weather derivatives trade occurred , the market [P_94] an estimated 4,500 weather transactions worth more than us$ 6bn .
through the otc market , [P_91] kind of structure , " ribeiro says .
to compensate , a realistic hourly weather simulation engine is needed [P_93] replicate thousands of multi - regional weather scenarios , said rookley .
initial [P_90] were that the treasury 's move a fortnight ago would [P_94] societies to embrace synthetic securitisations - and thus [P_97] fuel credit derivative market growth .
on closer examination , those [P_91] seem to be fading .
also , the assets [P_91] for synthetic securitisation are relatively small , " said chris carman , a vice - president within jp morgan 's structured products group in london .
while some smaller building societies [P_91] candidates for synthetic securitisations because they are cheaper and require less documentation than traditional securitisations , others may not have concentrations large enough to warrant the use of synthetic securitisations .
[P_90] building societies [P_91] be viable candidates for synthetic securitisations , may not [P_95] to [P_96] infrastructure required to otherwise actively trade credit derivatives , noted janet tavakoli , executive director and head of structuring [P_913] derivatives at westlb in london .
building societies [P_90] to be securitising an asset pool of more than e500 m to warrant entering into the transaction because the cost of [P_98] these transactions is quite sizeable , other industry officials said .
a building society 's ability to use credit derivatives hinges [P_93] it fits on a bsc - created spectrum that assigns eligibility based on criteria such as sufficient [P_99] using derivatives and adequate systems to capture and [P_913] credit derivatives business .
an institution ranked in the middle of the five - tier spectrum will have to apply and to make a strong case for why it [P_98] use credit derivatives .
building societies are most likely to use synthetic securitisations [P_93] product areas as a way to transfer out the risk related to a [P_98] or for transferring the risk of higher - weighted assets , industry officials said .
the [P_90] building societies to use credit derivatives occurred because the bsc 's regulatory jurisdiction over building societies is being transferred to the fsa in november .
according to some industry officials , building societies ' current practice of using insurance to reduce borrower risk [P_96] turn out to [P_97] prompts them to enter the credit derivatives market .
theoretically , credit derivatives [P_91] the place of mortgage guarantees .
the societies have [P_91] to use only [P_92] rate and foreign exchange derivatives .
we continue [P_90] generating capacity , which provides an inventory of [P_94] capacity [P_95] low - cost , high - value optionality in a highly volatile market - place , " skilling said .
audit david yeres , a partner specialising in derivatives law at clifford [P_94] rogers & wells in new [P_96] , says : " a number of our clients have asked us to do a contract audit in response to the scrutiny management is [P_914] these exposures and the adequacy of [P_917] .
he adds : " [P_91] very hard at upgrading our contracts , we 're analysing our contracts in light of market [P_97] and our [P_98] in california .
clifford [P_90] 's yeres expects that i the california crisis will accelerate acceptance of more - sophisticated master agreements .
for instance , [P_91] of structure using collateral threshold amounts or guarantees , or any type of [P_97] mechanism .
i know a lot of the suppliers [P_92] quite a bit [P_94] language for transactions with the california department of water ,
however , the concepts contained in the eel master that are similar to those in the isda master agreement . which has stood the [P_98] time and been proven in court .
isda itself has an initiative under way that , when complete , could [P_94] energy marketers operating in california .
it [P_90] at [P_91] master agreement to cover both physical and financial transactions .
haedicke , who is [P_91] board member and chair of the energy [P_94] products committee [P_95] this , says : " it [P_98] a much [P_99] world if [P_911] find a way to use the isda master for both physically and financially settled transactions , and find a way to net across physical and financial collateral collateral is another area being scrutinised in the wake of the california crisis .
under the concept of " adequate assurances " [P_92] , a party to a [P_95] contract with " reasonable " grounds to [P_98] insecure about the [P_99] of its counterparty to fulfill its responsibilities [P_912] demand performance assurance such as collateral .
[P_90] documentation , some energy traders [ have ] been [P_93] terminate and close - out transactions at an earlier stage than others using the so - called ' early termination events '
the costs and opportunity costs of [P_92] this debacle should ensure that the lessons of the california crisis are long remembered .
isma said these bodies needed to [P_92] in a constructive way to [P_94] a more harmonised security settlement environment in europe to " substantially reduce " the number of failed transactions .
the organisation 's intervention [P_91] increase pressure on europe 's 26 different clearing and settlement systems [P_95] up co - operation so costs [P_98] be reduced .

at the end of the call , pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was [P_97] , but at the end he said that he thought [P_910] probably [P_911] through a number of the issues
we said that [P_91] be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that [P_98] then " [P_99] notes .
pirog said cdwr [P_91] willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects cdwr 's ability to perform under the contract , most particularly its ability to pay for power .
( such an [P_91] likely would [P_92] a ca legislature or regulatory generated change ) .
right that has been offered , it was discussed that [P_93] be structured in such a way that epmi could walk from the deal ( without receiving or paying a termination payment ) up until a date certain ( september 1 and september 30 were mentioned by me as [P_916] , although pirog said that other suppliers had a [P_920] window )
pirog said he thought cdwr [P_91] with us on that .
however , he said cdwr [P_91] willing to consider having a downgrade [P_94] a " no ld walk right " for epmi and perhaps an event justifying epmi in suspending deliveries .
in other words , a downgrade event [P_92] be treated like an event of default , but no termination payment would be owed and epmi would have [P_99] to suspend performance .
however , when asked about the idea of a cross default out w / out a termination payment , he stated that he [P_97] to [P_98] that further with cdwr .
my sense is that [P_91] get comfortable with it in general .
i [P_90] that the situs issue [P_92] a big one for richard sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise .
pirog offered [P_90] us sample language , which we said [P_93] .
also , he said it was a possibility that the california attorney general would issue the [P_95] the bonds , so [P_97] possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from hawkins .
pirog stated that [P_91] covenants we [P_92] are conceptually [P_93] him , but [P_95] to [P_96] internally with cdwr .
pirog said he [P_91] up with cdwr [P_92] often it plans to give suppliers financial information .

after [P_90] relevant commercial , legal and environmental [P_93] the respective project managers [P_95] personnel , enron recommends that the following courses of action be undertaken : 1 .
assuming that pgl assumes the role of buyer under the terms of the land purchase agreement executed between pgl and air liquide on 4/11/2000 and pgl plans [P_99] to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing , perc and pgl should immediately begin [P_913] of the documents necessary to achieve the icc [P_916] of any [P_917] transfer ( sale , lease , or alternative structure ) of the torrence south parcel from pgl to torrence power llc .
this recommendation is based upon the belief that although the torrence south parcel does hold [P_95] to perc and enron as a project development site , the overall viability and risk / reward profile of the commercial [P_912] has not yet been sufficiently finalized .
the site ( in combination with the calumet [P_92] ) represents [P_93] component of [P_95] a commercial solution to the mission energy / comed 500 mw " in - city " regulatory obligation to the city of the chicago .
the [P_90] contributing to the [P_91] perc and enron not [P_93] to [P_94] 6/26/00 are [P_96] :
the incomplete status of [P_91] commercial [P_92] associated with the torrence south parcel .
d. perc and enron 's desire to maintain [P_92] to minimize [P_94] costs while further developing the commercial [P_96] associated value proposition prior to executing an icc - approved land transfer from pgl to torrence power llc .
the south parcel represents a potential power [P_92] site upon which perc and enron [P_95] to conduct due [P_97] activities .
perc and enron [P_91] risk mitigation strategies including land options , environmental indemnifications , and other [P_96] which protect their respective assets and [P_98] economic viability of a [P_910] on the torrence south parcel .
perc [P_90] personnel have estimated that the icc [P_92] require up to 6 months ( the transfer of the calumet parcel was " fast - tracked " and took 3 months to achieve icc [P_912] ) .
this risk could [P_91] viability of an ' 01 in - service [P_94] a torrence power llc [P_96] .
perc and enron shall [P_91] a binding agreement which specifies an approval and cost - sharing mechanism [P_96] decisions on the torrence south parcel .
such an agreement shall also specify a formula for the sharing of proceeds associated with the marketing / selldown strategy currently [P_97] by perc and enron for all of the chicago development projects .

mark , i am [P_91] report that [P_92] extremely hard to collect all of the information that has [P_97] ( and then some ) for purposes of [P_910] due diligence visit .
while [P_90] current [P_91] awano and seguchi we touched upon [P_94] reaction to our valuation and came upon a fundamental realization .
[P_90] enron [P_91] to [P_92] the assumptions we have utilized i still [P_95] share some fundamental numbers [P_97] in order to put this value into perspective .
in other words , if we were to flip [P_93] at financial close [P_94] at least this much .
looked at [P_90] , discounting the [P_92] back to 2001 at 15 % results in a current [P_96] of $ 558 million , or more than $ 34 per current [P_910] share !
[P_90] hard to believe [P_92] that your due diligence will bear them out .
[P_90] just these two [P_91] placing a ridiculously low 20 % probability [P_94] on them [P_96] the $ 3 per share of cash on our balance sheet gives you nearly $ 20 per share current value .
this is without considering oita or any of the other many [P_93] are [P_94] on .
if enron , with all of its [P_92] resources [P_93] , were to fully support encom on these two [P_96] believe that [P_98] of their success [P_99] quite high .
( we have been receiving [P_91] support from the global lng group by the way )
this is also why i would [P_92] that we focus our immediate attention on these two projects [P_95] with perhaps the oita lng project .
i [P_90] that [P_91] agree that reaching a conclusion as quick [P_94] is in all shareholders interests .
my main concern continues to be that the current infighting between [P_93] and e power [P_95] enron 's [P_96] to recognize 1 ) the quality and [P_99] the employees of e power and 2 ) the significant value that has [P_914] through the nearly 2 years of systematic and comparative analysis of all of the potential greenfield sites in japan as well as the [P_920] respect to brownfield developments .
within [P_90] six [P_91] to take off of the market nearly three quarters of the most attractive [P_97] sites [P_98] leaving little for the late comers to the japanese market .
we continue to [P_91] a way [P_93] our mutual energies [P_95] value in [P_96] market rather than on non - [P_99] bickering and turf wars .
[P_90] had [P_91] to [P_92] csa [P_93] .

all are wondering whether deregulation [P_91] - and whether benefits [P_93] broadly flow .
the cost to go into a [P_92] area and market to [P_93] is so high while the return on residential customers is so low that the pursuit of residential customers just may not [P_911] it for non - incumbent utilities .
a fully deregulated [P_91] large numbers of residential and small business customers participating ... remains at least a couple of years away .
you have [P_90] a discount and by the time you offer a discount , then the spread between the actual price and the wholesale price is too [P_99] .
the state has imposed rate caps [P_92] ensure that residential customers ca n't be harmed by volatile prices .
while consumer groups [P_91] complain about high rates and some industry insiders may project a darker [P_95] residential customers , other experts saythe current situation is just a matter of a newly deregulated industry experiencing growing pains .
competition should live up to its promise of lower rates for everyone , but residential customers [P_95] to resign themselves to the fact that larger - volume users [P_99] greater savings from deregulation than they will .

i had a [P_91] trena mcfarland today picking up on earlier discussions with respect to [P_95] for the softs business to be conducted out of london [P_99] ( [P_910] e : mail of 2/2/01 for detailed discussion of the alternatives ) .
trena said that there was a strong legal preference to use ena rather than a new us corporation for the trading activity conducted out of new [P_98] , and that ectric ( or [P_911] llc ) through eeft [P_912] the principal for uk trading activity .
as a result of this trena is considering establishing parallel books such that , for example , the london based traders would offer prices on nybot [P_98] - alike and the nybot / liffe spread trades as well as offering prices on the liffe [P_914] - alike trades .
the [P_90] this route is that there is the possibility of arbitrage since the products will have overlapping hours of trading .
the [P_90] of arbitrage [P_91] restricted to those counterparties which are registered both with london [P_95] via eol and are thus [P_98] see both prices with a bit of collusion - [P_911] the case of a global counterparty which is operating through one or more branches .

an industry comment period [P_91] global capital rules dubbed " basel 2 " ends on thursday , but [P_96] will just [P_97] for banks calculating how the sweeping [P_910] affect their businesses .
one reason for the haste is that the basel committee on banking supervision [P_94] new rules worries an industry stalemate [P_97] adoption of the badly - needed new rules in [P_910] jurisdictions .
unofficial dialogues [P_90] continue for a long while .
banks complain basel 2 's calibration formulae , as spelled out in a draft published in january , penalise the irb approach , saying set - asides for risky corporates , for example , [P_911] higher than what is called for by a standardised approach applied for less sophisticated banks .
one fear is that [P_91] lead small and mid - sized banks using the standardised approach to wind [P_96] a disproportionately larger exposure to riskier borrowers .
supervisors are expected to [P_91] the kinks , however , and are expected to take into [P_95] data collected by the basel committee under a quantitative [P_99] study ( www.bis.org ) .
but now [P_90] as though [P_92] .

by kathleen [P_90] dubbed virtual portfolios , risk measurement services that include a ' what - if ' scenario along with the more traditional kind of risk analysis are gaining in importance .
deutsche 's ' what - if positions change ' [P_93] , released to clients in mid - [P_95] , includes features to determine [P_97] value at risk ( var ) , tracking error and surplus - at - risk resulting from a variety of hypothetical situations .
managers who [P_90] use of the client risk reporting enhancement [P_93] have a better [P_95] on whether a particular [P_96] better correlate a fund to an index , for example .
the current var analysis tools have already been mastered by the fund community , which is now [P_95] predictors of risk .
var is tied to a particular probability at present and fails to capture [P_94] in an index , for example , said guillaume blacher , senior managing director , pricing advisory and risk management .
more managers [P_90] , rather than have a single number that comes out once a day , " she said , referring to the benefits of scenario analysis over traditional risk measurement practices .
the hypothetical scenario tools , along with the traditional var risk measurement systems , [P_94] by fund managers in a complementary way , stated reech capital 's blacher .
hypothetical analysis tools will [P_91] risk [P_92] deciphering what positions [P_94] to get back within a fund manager 's limit , he added .
he also credits the more educated investor [P_92] be prompting the fund manager to install better risk management and reporting systems , particularly [P_98] based funds , as fuelling the current demand for hypothetical risk analysis .
however , the current risk measurement systems [P_92] expensive for all but the largest trading organisations , and especially for start - up funds .
the fact that these virtual portfolio hypothetical analysis tools are now [P_93] is beginning [P_94] for hedge funds [P_97] up , according to imagine 's cannon .
with the right risk analysis tools , a hedge fund [P_93] up and running in a week , instead of hiring an entire it staff , he said .

while volatility levels dropped in the first [P_92] of the year due to supply and demand [P_95] , the past month has seen volatilities begin [P_98] up again .

the fact that vols have not risen in this way creates [P_93] value for those [P_95] use equity derivatives .

former oracle president and coo ray lane predicts [P_92] for dot - coms raymond j. lane , former president of oracle corporation [P_97] general partner at the silicon valley [P_910] capital firm kleiner perkins caufield & byers ( kpcb ) , will give his vision of [P_916] of the new economy to the haas community on friday , november 3 , at 4:00 p.m.
since his change in positions , lane has been quoted extensively that he believes [P_94] business is going to shift from just funding companies to playing an even [P_99] role in building those companies .
lane originally joined oracle as president of oracle usa [P_93] as a senior partner in the consulting firm of booz allen & hamilton .

[P_90] , whilst there maybe the [P_92] of mtm movement between the $ 180 purchase price from borealis and the subsequent sale ( index related price ) back to the counterpart , [P_910] be netted out .
the only issue is whether houston has sufficient resources or are willing to pay the storage costs early , [P_96] range between $ 1,200,000-?1,400,000 .
if this is feasible i [P_91] that we negotiate a discount of $ 15 on storage costs ( saving $ 600,000 ) as opposed to $ 10 .
the likely timeframe for selling the product [P_92] jan. 2002 as that is the highest otc swap price mkt which in turn would mean payment to borealis would [P_99] on 30 days past b / l.
