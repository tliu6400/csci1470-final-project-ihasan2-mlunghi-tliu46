[P_90] york -(dow jones)- banks should [P_92] to tighten the coordination between credit risks they are exposed to [P_96] markets , as they adapt to the changing requirements of the basel accord on capital requirements , a federal reserve study says .
specifically , the report cites exposure to derivatives as one [P_93] broader and more tightly integrated models of credit risk are likely to be a [P_98] requirement for banks .
[P_90] york federal reserve study , entitled " using credit risk [P_94] regulatory capital : issues and options , " is [P_97] publication in a forthcoming economic policy review .
when questioned , hirtle said the study 's reference to derivatives and to [P_94] for some banks to tighten correlations among different instruments of credit risk [P_99] was n't based on specific events or problems in the financial sector .
for positions that involve derivatives or that otherwise [P_92] to a material extent on market [P_95] , standards likely would require [P_97] models of market movements and credit exposures , " the report said .
she also gave an example in [P_92] of how a chain of events might lower the worth of a credit for a bank .
the coming [P_90] the basel accord , planned for introduction by 2004 , aim [P_95] the way that banks globally [P_97] for risk .
nobuaki kurisu , chief fund manager at sumisei global investment trust management , also cited derivatives -related selling as a factor in the stock market 's plunge , and added that such selling [P_911] market volatility high for the time being , making institutional investors [P_915] buy .
the rush to hedge equity linked derivative bonds , which usually [P_93] in six months to one year , offer higher interest rates than ordinary bonds if the nikkei stays above a pre - determined level .
but once the nikkei drops [P_91] that level , the return at the bond 's maturity will be lower than the initial investment .
it is designed to serve as a kind of calculation device to determine who can file under chapter 13 and who [P_97] file under chapter 7 .
the bill now must wait until the senate passes its version before a conference can be appointed [P_95] out differences between the two bills ( see related report in this section ) .
bonds that had previously [P_91] at a 60 handle could suddenly be tendered at par .
important insurance credit default swaps stipulate that in one of several [P_93] events - the declaration of a bankruptcy ; the failure to pay [P_98] on a loan or bond , or the restructuring , repudiation or acceleration of a loan that lowers [P_914] creditworthiness of a counterparty - the buyer of the swap may deliver to the seller any loan or bond extending out to a predefined maturity , and receive back par value in return .
because of the product , loan portfolio managers [P_92] sides of the atlantic have morphed in recent years into active traders , while insurance company and hedge fund managers gained a new way to position themselves .
nobody wants to throw a company into bankruptcy [P_92] 's a glimmer of [P_94] a [P_95] turn around [P_97] .
since the loan was renegotiated on the last day of the contract , bofa certainly [P_95] considered it a repaid loan , and then extended a new loan if it had [P_910] couch it in such terms , " says one dealer .
that path would have avoided [P_91] default .
the credit derivatives market has effectively bifurcated itself into two distinctly different products , and although it has n't yet reached a critical stage , participants are concerned that this bifurcation may [P_910] hurt overall market liquidity .
for example , would a bank give up its collection rights on a $ 20 million [P_95] swap if it had $ 1 billion in total loans [P_99] be thrown into the nonperforming category by a bankruptcy declaration ?
the conseco situation showed how a [P_92] default [P_92] trigger a credit derivatives exercise , but without the debt of the underlying company being truly hurt .
we have to establish a better standard for interdealer business , or risk less liquidity and a [P_95] of added basis risk within dealer books .
although achieving consensus will not be easy , kennaugh 's [P_93] that some standard acceptable to investors , hedgers and dealers alike [P_97] established .
the language to accomplish [P_91] require some [P_92] drafting , but the goal [P_94] to give sellers of credit derivatives more solace that [P_98] not be blindsided on a loan restructuring with the delivery of longer - dated paper , while the buyers of [P_915] swaps [P_916] still maintain the regulatory [P_918] to tender restructured paper .
this compromise , however , [P_91] a " two - step delivery option .
on [P_90] of a loan restructuring , the holder of a credit default swap [P_95] either tender the actual loan affected or a similar short - term piece of debt , or hold onto the credit derivative for the possibility of an actual bankruptcy event at a later date .
in other words , [P_91] be one central contract , but with a [P_94] delivery twist within it .
given the large [P_91] of potential underlying credits , however , the specific drafting required here [P_95] even more difficult for participants to agree on in advance .
such an approach might result [P_91] mismatches and basis risk on dealer books , but it [P_96] keep diverse end - user participants more satisfied .
people [P_90] what contracts they [P_92] trade , and [P_93] have to wait [P_95] which contract [P_96] be .
if banks [P_90] relief with restructuring included , that price exists today [P_94] continue to exist .
a year ago , for example , xerox [P_92] swaps were trading at just 30 basis points per annum .
it 's easy to imagine yet another [P_92] xerox may technically fall into default on certain obligations , but continue to pay interest on other paper .
lawsuits have n't sprung from the conseco situation , but they [P_93] for xerox since there is more money on the table .
[P_90] credit problems flare up [P_92] , isda documentation [P_93] come under even more scrutiny , with conseco simply having been the first warning shot across the bow of the credit derivatives market .

if [P_90] just get the sink out and lay it on its side , i 'll [P_95] slip him out .

the remaining three of us decided that getting rudy sedated was a [P_94] , but bill and i were [P_96] the area .

we are still scoping out the project [P_92] in indicitive quotes .
i will [P_90] are with the process .
.... [P_90] in providing a quote [P_93] on [P_94] .
we continue [P_90] on numbers and have had other co 's [P_94] for a quote .
[P_90] a note [P_91] and i will go [P_94] .
[P_90] achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is significantly more robust and stable than [P_97] one , and it is considerably less sensitive to the [P_911] coefficients .
to gauge the response of [P_91] to wildly - varying rpi [P_94] curve , a sine wave of period 3 years for rpi was [P_98] into the ppi model .
this shows that if we had [P_92] in our rpi [P_93] curve , then the ppi [P_95] reflect those peaks and humps adequately .
[P_90] model is plotted [P_91] in burgundy [P_92] compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue .
dear all , we thought it [P_92] brent crude as an explanatory variable for ppi ; it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long - term average of $ 18.80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for predictions the brent [P_917] produced by the global products group is used ) .
as [P_90] see , the two equations differ in the [P_93] - term and very long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term predictions of 3.0 % to 3.2 % over [P_913] six months .
this is only [P_91] the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009 ( which we do n't ) .
[P_90] now is a differently - specified [P_93] designed to forecast only [P_95] 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive error terms .
[P_90] far more accurate in [P_92] - term , and [P_94] include [P_95] onto the front of this long - term [P_99] .

delegates at the bonn climate change negotiations are expected [P_93] through saturday [P_94] additional decisions that will " incorporate and give full effect " to the agreement .
[P_90] , developed countries want the u.s. on board and this leaves room for the bush administration to [P_96] alternative -- though the [P_98] could close shortly .
however , [P_90] have a role in complying with emissions reduction obligations .
it is too early to tell [P_92] competitiveness or whether they [P_95] interpreted as non - tariff trade barriers .

those should [P_90] of a class on risk management .
the last of the warm air will be scoured out of [P_93] today with near to [P_95] temperatures for most of the country [P_98] .
a [P_90] southern jet stream [P_92] spin up two more [P_93] winter storms [P_94] .
imagine [P_90] if only there was more cold air in [P_93] .
a cool and dry weekend seems to be shaping up for most areas , but a weak low will drop out of canada , across the lakes and toward [P_99] england on sunday .
the current storm [P_91] drive out most of the available moisture , but some lake effect [P_95] so some light snow amounts should occur .
however , the [P_91] favorable for some sort of low pressure [P_94] in the vicinity of the gulf coast [P_97] week .
[P_90] head toward the se us and [P_92] factor .
it has had it for three runs in a row , but given the high surface pressures does not [P_96] as cold as i [P_98] have expected .
i [P_90] for most areas to run [P_92] or slightly below normal .
we [P_90] going [P_91] your accounting memo [P_93] .
finally , there are some conceptual points that i believe should [P_93] w/ relation to the unique structure for " softs " trading we have been planning .

i have [P_90] up the numbers and decide > whether > i 'm going to fill potholes out on rt .
i am leaving with regret , as i [P_92] all of you , and i believe ebs is poised for [P_97] asia .
[P_90] in a [P_91] transition , i [P_92] this report on the status of all ebs east asia regulatory affairs actions i am [P_98] on , and [P_99] about [P_910] .
again , many , [P_91] and for what i have learned about broadband [P_96] from each of you .
[P_90] not [P_91] on the application until [P_93] what legal entity to use .
this is a [P_91] option in my opinion as the regulator ( ida ) does not [P_95] at cross purposes with other parts of the government that wish to provide ebs with incentives .
for example it [P_91] that jan haizmann or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee ( done offshore for example ) .
jan i believe [P_91] on this that he adanced in the context of korea .
i believe it would still be prudent [P_92] as we had planned to engage a law firm here in singapore ( as we have in hong [P_99] and japan ) for the purpose of guiding [P_912] these sorts of questions ( or at least confirming our reading ) and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by a [P_920] group headed by wayne gardner .
the [P_90] i [P_91] with are andy haire and fiona yeo
i was to have gone to adl singapore next for a meeting to question them on how much of this they are [P_97] do independently without reliance on us .
so , to be awarded pioneer status , which the edb is very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion , i [P_98] edb demonstrate what the quantitative spin - off benefits are for singapore from our [P_914] bandwidth trading here ( e.g. increased efficiencies of capacity utilization , effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment ) .
the idea is to get adl to perform the quantitative economic development analysis [P_94] not do in - house .
( d ) direct contact with edb on ebs 's plans edb ( chelsia lim ) has this week asked ebs [P_97] her on its [P_98] for singapore .
i have made [P_91] craig clark [P_92] the responsibility for [P_93] this is handled .

the hk lawyers ( michelle chan of clifford [P_92] ) have said that if [P_94] other equipment at the outset , we ought to [P_99] and send in the correct description rather than revise .
when the system configuration plan is done in final , [P_93] to change the listed destination in the [P_96] from " san jose " to " west coast usa , [P_910] , singapore , [P_912] " .
when we know what equipment we are going to [P_93] , tom wei needs to revise the [P_96] and [P_96] in destination referred [P_99] .
my successor should [P_91] whole package once more with michelle chan in final .
someone needs [P_90] with ebs legal to get the t and c 's for media cast to michelle or to set up direct channel between ebs legal and michelle chan as in the case of the exchanges on the t and c 's for bandwidth trading referred [P_916] .

however , i would say that [P_92] we are running some risks .
[P_90] are going to [P_91] japan one of the centerpieces of our asia ebs strategy , i [P_96] need to consider devoting more full time ebs regulatory resources [P_910] exclusively .
the allocation problem is that whatever regulatory [P_92] apply have [P_93] on immediate license amendment and operational questions that drive out time [P_98] effectively [P_99] term issues such as how to go about amending the telecommunications business law to allow bandwidth trading explicitly .
this would seem [P_91] reduce long term risks to our business strategy .

to [P_90] its customers with [P_91] this summer [P_93] , san diego gas & electric ( sdg&e ) has requested from the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) $ 16 million over the [P_912] years to increase [P_913] energy - efficiency programs .
our customers [P_90] today in lowering their energy costs and today 's proposal will bring an [P_95] $ 16 million [P_97] encourage energy conservation in our region , " said edwin a. guiles , president of sdg&e. " this money [P_914] used [P_915] replace old , inefficient appliances , such as air conditioners and refrigerators , which will result in reduced electric bills and less strain on our state 's electric - supply system .
of the $ 16 million , sdg&e would allocate [P_93] $ 4.3 million exclusively for low - income energy - efficiency [P_97] programs over [P_98] two years .
under the proposal filed friday , the low - income [P_93] funds [P_94] used [P_95] existing programs , such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler replacements , while introducing [P_910] programs , including room air - conditioner replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair .
[P_90] the programs are still being developed , but they should [P_94] place in early september .
friday 's proposal marks the latest in a series of actions sdg&e has taken recently [P_95] customers grapple with high electric prices .
that proposal , combined with the deregulation - dividend checks most sdg&e customers will receive [P_95] month , will result in a total of about $ 500 million [P_99] to them in august and september -- nearly$300 for the typical residential customer -- [P_914] ease cash - flow [P_916] higher electricity prices .
those customers participating in the [P_91] see bills this summer that are comparable to last summer 's bills .
sdg&e also has increased communications [P_91] residential and business customers regarding [P_94] in the energy marketplace , available energy - efficiency funding and conservation [P_98] for reducing electric bills .

i [P_90] the idea on grouping a small number of movies to increase liquidity [P_94] need [P_96] diversification [P_98] be done [P_99] market .
if enron wants to take some position , i [P_93] that we must be diversified enough ( 15 + movies as the consultant said ) .
[P_90] have made the same expected return with a lot less risk by investing in s&p500 . )
but we [P_90] have ( or expected to have ) a significant [P_94] of similar deals of other movies . )
[P_90] take positions , but initially [P_92] to find the other side of any deal we 'd do .
i [P_90] let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it .
otherwise , if our forecast is not consistence with the market , [P_94] have an imbalance in the bid - ask orders and [P_98] end up [P_99] positions .
this way , [P_91] our positions easily and [P_93] also behave like a broker where we do n't take [P_97] at all .

in the [P_90] , i think the gross box office [P_93] be determined from the market itself ( i.e. , if there are lots of buyers , our offer price should go up . )
we [P_90] offer other derivative products such as options as well .

thus , constellation [P_91] a prime position if the desire for nuclear - generated power continues to rise , as the company anticipates .

[P_90] me [P_91] . 5 - 7621 [P_93] questions .
while i [P_90] should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone , i nonetheless [P_95] of some [P_97] set forth a few preliminary focal points for [P_911] , particularly if you do n't get to [P_914] a [P_915] .
i thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as i was thinking [P_94] of the issues / positions .
also , i 'll have to run down the conflict issue when i [P_94] into the office , but i [P_97] i [P_97] generally [P_98] ppa in [P_99] .
[P_90] , i did not know whether it was ena 's or dynegy 's obligation [P_95] on a response to cms , but i thought it [P_99] sense [P_910] what one might [P_912] on paper .
[P_90] below , there are some issues underlying [P_93] .
while many of the relevant computations are done on a [P_93] basis -- which generally supports mplp 's position -- the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a [P_910] basis results in two anomalies : namely , the stated capacity charge ( on exhibit d ) for " year 1 " only would [P_919] 3 months , but even more importantly , the capacity charge ( on exhibit d ) for " year 35 " would apply for the last 21 months of the contract term .
my overall concern is that an arbitrator [P_92] focus on the anomaly ( described above ) that results by applying exhibit d using a [P_98] concept ( i.e. , the 21 month " year 35 " issue ) since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around ..
more before a [P_91] conclusion on the issue [P_92] made , we likely [P_94] or undertake , as the case [P_98] , [P_99] such as ( which i assume [P_911] generally obtain from the michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e - mail you forwarded ) : --the michigan puc presumably approved the ppa ( prior to the first amendment ) in a published order .
( [P_90] be particularly [P_91] try to settle out the dispute on the basis that mplp would concede the issue on a prospective basis only ) .
certain points in support of mplp 's position --the definition of " contract capacity factor " provides for a calendar year determination and , most importantly , provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the cod occurs that ends at the end of that [P_916] .
( [P_90] the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments [P_95] ) .

in [P_90] , the newly released may [P_92] to the governor 's budget submission confirms the substantial revenue deterioration that is expected to emerge over [P_98] eighteen months due to the weak [P_911] sector and stock market .
[P_90] revision commences what is likely to be a difficult budget debate .
to date , the state 's general fund cash advances for power purchases total approximately $ 4 billion , and these advances are [P_97] to grow [P_98] in the coming months .
moody 's estimates that the state 's ending cash position [P_93] approximately $ 10 billion at june 30 , 2001 , including both general fund cash and internal " borrowable resources " , which represents cash [P_912] be borrowed by the general fund beyond the end of the fiscal year .
as a result , the state 's cash reserves are likely to [P_94] depleted by the time long - term financing can be secured .
the [P_90] of the early 1990s indicates that a substantial portion of borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity .
we are currently assuming the state 's general fund may not [P_93] reimbursed by the proceeds of the long - term financing , as such full reimbursement would reduce the amount of bond proceeds [P_911] power purchases , and require dwr to seek [P_915] rate increases during 2001 .
based primarily on the downturn in the [P_92] sector , which relies heavily on options in compensation packages , and the sluggish performance of the stock market and its adverse [P_910] on capital gains , the state has reduced its tax revenue [P_914] the [P_915] year by approximately $ 5.4 billion , including a $ 2.7 downward revision in the personal income tax .
the drop in these sources of income [P_92] temper growth in sales tax collections for [P_95] year .
the proposed budgetary reductions , along [P_92] spending levels for recurring items such as education , [P_95] lead to prolonged budget debate in the coming weeks .
while such budget negotiations [P_91] not necessarily [P_92] the [P_93] of the issuance of the long - term power bonds , delay [P_97] weaken the state 's fiscal position .
the energy crisis will have economic , as well as financial , consequences that [P_94] uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook .
the drivers of the forecasts include the outlook for the [P_93] sector , as well as the important housing sector .
in moody 's view , the forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate the [P_95] of these difficult to [P_97] dimensions of the energy crisis .
at the moment , [P_91] that the substantial cash resources accumulated by the state of california during the [P_96] the last decade , in combination with the planned long - term energy financing will [P_912] it to avert the degree of fiscal damage that would call for the rating to fall to the a [P_918] .
while [P_90] that the state will [P_92] a viable long - term energy financing over [P_96] few months , substantial obstacles must be overcome to meet that goal .

the decision would have prevented the commission from [P_92] legislation that prohibits direct access , at least during the time that legislature and the direct access coalition [P_99] to [P_910] with a compromise to continue to allow direct access .
[P_90] have been [P_91] if the commission had passed it , though .
also , did i tell you that i 'm in a meeting all day [P_94] houston and therefore ca n't [P_97] update [P_98] edward 's
i [P_90] , however , do it on monday .
claudia - [P_90] so [P_91] responding .
the materials that we [P_91] for at each office are the following .
the numbers and contact [P_91] each location are below .
with respect to what else [P_91] offer them : from a commercial standpoint , i 'm sure you 're scouring [P_97] , and i may not have much [P_910] .
another commercial angle might be mission energy , but again , not [P_94] mission fares from a credit [P_97] .
one idea that we 've bounced around that might appeal to edison -- [P_94] not be appealing to us
that is , in [P_91] 100 cents on the dollar , we 'd agree to take , for example , a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon .
it might [P_90] a useful [P_91] that edison [P_92] with other creditors , and
the " note " angle [P_91] packaged [P_92] the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with fielder .
i [P_90] i [P_91] information sufficient [P_93] the right decision .

[P_90] just a [P_92] , the places we are ( in my humble [P_96] overridden opinion ) most likely [P_98] are :
the bight on norman island - deserted island but a floating bar / restaurant , [P_95] snorkeling nearby jost van dyke - we have always [P_98] sydney 's peace & love in little harbor and foxy 's [P_912] harbor sandy cay - the classic deserted island , very small - probably just a [P_918] quick swim
trellis bay - closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a restaurant called the last resort cooper island - [P_97] quiet resort on the island with a good outdoor dining option
[P_90] we are anchored somewhere near tortola ( which probably just means not at the bitter end or on st. john ) the night before your flight [P_910] get to the airport .
[P_90] drop you anywhere else
there 's a phone since there are taxis that [P_93] called and the island just is n't that big - i do n't [P_98] more than an hour by car to get from any one spot on the island to any other !
[P_90] use them [P_92] check anything since that [P_94] it much [P_95] that they [P_96] us some day .
i 'm not sure , but it may [P_92] it just a tad [P_94] get through bvi customs when they [P_97] familiar tags .
the following servers [P_91] coming down , [P_92] on the icon for [P_94] and scheduled times : system outage notification for : pr1 - apollo production outage start : (

[P_90] than a year viacom has said it was waiting for a recovery in blockbuster 's stock -- long stalled [P_97] its offering price -- before it [P_99] with previously announced plans to split off the remaining 82.3 % of the publicly traded unit .
blockbuster has been picking up market share and growing the business , " mr. karmazin said , adding that viacom was " very [P_97] its [P_98] prospects .
viacom 's change of mind is [P_92] to spark speculation that the [P_94] an offer to buy the 17.7 % of blockbuster stock outstanding that is in the public 's hands , [P_911] to tap the cash now being generated by the chain .
when viacom originally acquired the business in 1994 , it [P_93] be a cash cow that [P_96] pay for the paramount communications acquisition that year .
but instead , blockbuster turned into a problem child , as growth in the video market ground to a [P_96] halt and the unit spent most of its cash on building [P_910] stores .
blockbuster has [P_90] to grab market share , reflecting fading competition from other chains and independent stores .
at the time viacom planned to unload within about a year of the ipo its remaining blockbuster holding by offering viacom shareholders a [P_97] exchange their [P_99] stock in the video - rental unit .
blockbuster stock rallied sharply in the first couple of months of this year , from around $ 8 at the end of last year to a [P_98] $ 15.10 in late february .
but mr. wood has said he believes that the agency needs to [P_94] to ensure well - functioning energy markets in california and other places or risk [P_99] deregulation fail entirely . '
he also received $ 7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as [P_94] 782,830 shares [P_95] be valued at $ 35 million if enron 's stock [P_99] 10 percent annually .
u.s.-based enron corp on wednesday presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) fired power plant in northern [P_97] , aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant in japan .
the [P_90] brings enron one step [P_92] realising its plan to build a power plant with [P_95] capacity of two million kilowatts in aomori prefecture .
the plant , to [P_91] by e power corp - a wholly - owned unit of [P_95] - could eventually [P_97] capacity to 3 - 4 million kilowatts [P_99] is enough demand .
jones)- [P_90] corp. ( japan ) , a new - [P_93] power [P_94] set up by
according to the plan , [P_91] plans to [P_92] a gas - turbine combined cycle power plant with an initial capacity of 2,000 megawatts in the mutsu ogawara industrial area in aomori in the northern part of japan 's main island .
construction is scheduled to [P_91] 2004 , following an environmental assessment [P_94] from relevant authorities , for commercial operation in 2007 or later .
building a large power plant that is relatively environmentally - friendly in the mutsu ogawara [P_95] the economy and [P_97] the prefecture , " governor morio kimura said .
the proposed [P_90] also [P_91] lure enterprises of various kinds to [P_94] operations in [P_95] , kimura said in a statement .
encom is considering other sites [P_91] on which [P_93] build large - scale power plants .
since japan [P_90] retail power market [P_92] - lot high - volume industrial and commercial users - which represent roughly 30 % of total power demand - to free competition in march 2000 , a number [P_912] entrants have been tapping into the country 's y15 trillion industry .
however , comprehensive pricing and other [P_92] of the whole project are n't expected to be finalized for another [P_96] .
this is a state which has a reasonably sound record at [P_93] resources mobilisation , but is now facing an unprecedented [P_97] crunch .
sources with financial institutions said that if l&t is finalised as the [P_94] partner , [P_95] , procurement , construction contractor .
the company has proposed [P_91] investment of $ 2 million in [P_94] subsidiary [P_95] be increased subsequently .
enron 's initiative in [P_91] be watched with interest , a government official said .
the company has an installed wind power generator adjacent to its dabhol project in maharashtra which has been continuously gauging the nature of wind and [P_98] of using wind as a perennial source of power in the country .
according to the company 's official website , the western coast of the country has been identified as a [P_96] area of proposed projects .
however , the site map does not [P_92] information on the exact location of the project .
over the [P_90] decades , the company has designed and constructed wind power facilities around the world comprising more than 4,500 wind turbines and 1,600 mega watts of capacity .
enron wind offers wind turbine technology , skilled project development , creative financing options , accomplished power plant [P_96] , and [P_97] and responsive support services .

skilling said texans are in a [P_92] position and should n't worry that their state 's deregulation [P_96] like the california [P_97] .

that [P_90] very high prices .

skilling said he expected demand pressure to keep natural gas prices high for several years until demand [P_95] curbed [P_96] production [P_97] brought into play , possibly by increasing the import of liquefied natural gas .
building new facilities [P_91] liquefied gas , storing it and returning it to gaseous form for burning would be expensive [P_97] attractive as long as natural gas prices remain above $ 3.50 per thousand cubic feet , he said .
he also received $ 7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as [P_94] 782,830 shares [P_95] be valued at $ 35 million if enron 's stock [P_99] 10 percent annually over the life of [P_912] .

but these same customers [P_91] take on [P_92] exposure to other forms of credit [P_95] instruments without increasing their borrowing .
he is also worried about how courts [P_92] countries would treat these contracts .
by andrea reierson consolidation in the global banking sector [P_93] it harder to keep swaps the preserve of the otc marketplace and may push them onto a centralised exchange , the bank for international settlements ( bis ) said in its quarterly review .
this increasing concentration of swap books may spark strong pressure [P_93] listed on an organised exchange where counterparty risk is taken by the exchange 's clearing house , bis said .
trading [P_90] rate swaps has risen relative to futures and options trading in treasury [P_95] bonds with transactions in coupon - bearing us treasuries peaking in 1998 while those in private instruments continue to rise , the bis said .
the continued [P_90] the [P_91] swaps market also underpinned demand for money market products , typically the most common hedging [P_97] swaptions .
nevertheless , though the effects of these excesses are likely to continue for much of this year in the form of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings [P_99] of [P_910] banks , these problems , one [P_912] , will prove modest both by historical standards and relative to [P_916] of these institutions .

few of the contracts introduced by established marketplaces in recent years have met with an [P_95] response , and the gains [P_97] by some contracts have largely reflected a reallocation of business away from traditional benchmarks , " said bis economist serge jeanneau in the international body 's quarterly review .
a [P_90] of activity also took place in europe in the late 1990s , with eurex capturing business in the long - term segment of the euro yield [P_99] and liffe achieving dominance in [P_911] - term area , " said janneau in the report .
janneau believes the falling number of non - government [P_93] to exchanges introducing contracts based on corporate and asset - backed securities .
examples of likely [P_91] behaviour include the us bond market association 's [P_94] last september to [P_95] proposals for a corporate bond futures contract , and cbot 's efforts to introduce mortgage - backed contracts .

before considering the [P_91] landscape , it is worth [P_93] various phases of the market during the last few years .
nevertheless , despite the lack of highly leveraged [P_92] , companies throughout the region continued to fund long - term local currency investments with [P_98] term foreign currency (
corporate credit quality is slowly [P_91] and a recent trend has been the increasing use of derivatives by financial institutions - particularly local banks and fund managers .
this is expected to continue as [P_92] leads to a focus on yield enhancement and credit risk management .
the emergence of domestic bond markets is having a [P_93] impact on [P_94] , both directly and indirectly .
there is a direct impact where bond issues are swapped into a different currency ( in the case of foreign issuers [P_97] a market ) , or [P_99] ( where issuers [P_910] alter the [P_912] basis ) .
additionally , the increased availability of instruments in the market and greater demand [P_94] from investors is leading to new local currency products , such as options on domestic interest rates and securities .
[P_90] turn requires [P_91] regulatory consideration , which has generally been in line with international standards .
[P_90] , it is reasonable [P_92] a mend towards regulatory harmonization and increasing adoption of international regulatory standards .
there has been continual [P_91] as the number of users increases , more products become [P_95] regulations put in place to allow healthy market [P_98] .
nevertheless , the derivatives markets in asia will continue [P_93] and [P_94] as end - users grow in number and sophistication , while [P_98] of products continues [P_99] .
but with the forthcoming fourth financial markets enhancement act there [P_93] light at the end of the tunnel .
it is , however , widely expected - or at least hoped - that the forthcoming fourth financial markets [P_96] act will include the introduction of a statutory definition of borsentermingeschafte .
its conceptual [P_90] is controvasial3 and the continuous [P_92] types of transactions requires a provision which is as comprehensive [P_97] .
but the meager contribution provided by equity markets masked an [P_93] 28 per cent increase on volumes from levels last year , and a 14 per cent increase in exchange traded options .
use of [P_90] rate agreements more than doubled during the year to $ 1 trillion making it the fastest growing market segment for the year .
` ` the [P_91] market was more volatile this year than last and that means there was greater underlying customer demand for [P_97] hedging , ' ' said mr. farrow .
` ` the market has [P_91] considerably .
bankers who [P_90] closely with the basle committee on banking supervision say it is likely to [P_95] three different [P_96] banking supervisors : basic [P_98] ( that is , a single proxy for the entire bank , such as trading volumes ) ; a business line approach using committee - imposed capital ratio ; or thirdly , internal measurement using a bank 's own loss data within a supervisory specified [P_920] .
the implication is that [P_91] and [P_92] the internal measurement approach [P_94] result an [P_95] of appropriate models and a fourth regulatory option , based on internal modelling .
the principal message to regulators is that [P_92] banks [P_93] measurement and management should achieve lower capital charges .
joseph sabitini , managing director in the corporate risk management group at jp morgan [P_94] york , recognises that a [P_97] regulatory [P_97] must accommodate banks at all levels of sophistication in terms of risk measurement and management , but that it also includes a risk - based option for " those with [P_919] capability " .
stages three and four [P_91] to [P_92] for the measurement and management of those risks within a firm .
we have also looked at a number of quantification techniques , [P_93] their effectiveness [P_95] on the quality and quantity of the data [P_98] .
the current challenge is to find a way around the lack of data on big loss [P_95] .
according to tony peccia , vice - president in the operational risk management division at cibc world markets in toronto , most banks would [P_98] the internal measurement stage of the proposed capital charge when implemented - which [P_913] on internal data .
the paper highlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach could [P_93] institutions with poor operational risk management processes and controls , but [P_97] to internal loss event data , to achieve a lower capital charge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but no access to internal loss event data .
the paper also highlights fears over the method of calculation of [P_93] capital for an institution that has recently experienced serious loss , but where [P_98] reacted and strengthened the control environment in [P_911] , and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence .
the paper argues blat there is [P_92] in the industry for a regulatory capital [P_95] allows institutions managing [P_97] to effectively access a more precise means of calculating an operational risk capital charge - institutions should [P_913] more sophisticated controls and the regulatory regime [P_916] establish incentives to [P_917] risk management and controls .
insurance and risk transfer [P_91] become an [P_92] and sophisticated component in an [P_94] manager 's [P_95] - box over the [P_97] years .
although some products on the market [P_92] immediate liquidity to a bank following a disaster , [P_95] be certain arguments after the event .
rachlin also highlights reputational issues : " while insurance [P_93] cover [P_93] - term financial [P_95] for some events the longer term reputation impact [P_98] of greater concern .
insurance will play a role as an instrument [P_92] , but not in its [P_95] .... we are waiting for the regulators .
victor dowd , an associate involved with [P_92] capital charge discussion at the uk 's financial services authority agrees that further and more detailed [P_98] the internal measurement approach [P_910] result in the [P_911] of appropriate models .

( paul is scheduled to speak to us [P_92] a decision .
[P_90] remember in the beginning of [P_92] piloting autonomy or an unstructured data management [P_96] in order [P_97] and quantitative information .
[P_90] , we discussed the value in finding a product [P_93] identify experts [P_95] .
however , only 50 % of those interviewed suggested they would tag email for others to search regardless if [P_96] identify experts .
but , over 90 % of those surveyed agreed an enterprise [P_93] .
autonomy provides some feature / functionality to [P_92] email ( the full extent of [P_94] be [P_95] by the sst ) .
are we prepared to invest in a much more expensive [P_93] with categorization feature / functionality which [P_96] a more robust search platform of [P_98] or should we decide to invest in the best value for [P_913] needs ?
this distinction was arrived at after [P_92] characteristics described in the charter and associated survey as to what was meant by an unstructured data management tool .
to stay within the time frame of [P_92] project , the scope of the search tool evaluation [P_96] on these three vendors .

enron officials spoke of the water business in much the same way they now talk about broadband : it 's a fragmented international market worth $ 300 billion a year , and [P_910] extend its [P_912] to [P_912] and win a huge share of that market .
` ` i think our legacy will be that we proved [P_93] build a business on intellectual capital , not physical assets . ' ' a self - described business history buff , skilling argues that the era of corporate [P_913] based on gathering assets is over .
when enron created its broadband business , for example , it moved 60 people -- mainly from enron 's energy - trading units -- into the new division in [P_99] of a week .

stacey , based on jeremy 's responses [P_92] , [P_93] alternative [P_95] curve and keep the usd without system [P_98] .
let 's assume the following : postid currency - usd postid otc int type crv - alternative arg [P_96] deal currency - usd deal level [P_99] curve - alternative arg interest rate [P_911] results : the portcalc would be valued using the alternative arg [P_915] .
with an output currency code of " usd " , and your deals are booked in tagg to " aa int " for int ( [P_98] ) , then portcalc [P_910] the [P_911] you specify in your postid .
these 2 books do satisfy [P_91] requirements , so if you specify an alternate [P_95] curve in your postid , portcalc [P_97] pv with that curve .
due to the high [P_91] that the argentine peso and the usd will not continue to [P_95] 1 to 1 , [P_97] to begin valuing the portfolios using an argentina interest rate [P_911] .
and i recall that you thought it would require system [P_93] .
at this time [P_91] to [P_92] to specify usd but pv at an alternative [P_95] .
[P_90] i though about was possibly adding a new currency called argusd and having it use the alternative [P_96] curve .

after a string of weaker - than - expected economic data , friday 's employment report came in stronger [P_96] .
on the surface , this suggests strength in the economy ; however , the drop was caused by a decline in the number of people [P_98] jobs .
* net net , we [P_91] a very positive outlook for jackup oriented companies .
we continue to forecast a long cycle , with strong utilization and rising day rates over [P_95] three or more years and highly attractive valuations .
* as [P_90] business signals are mixed and stocks remain volatile , we 're taking a 12 month view that trends for ems in 02 [P_98] significantly .
while [P_90] see [P_91] weakness in share prices [P_93] , investors [P_94] to position themselves for the eventual rebound , and calling the bottom has been [P_99] .
from a [P_90] sense we believe top - tier ems cos [P_93] achieve 20 % top and bottom line growth in 02 , y / y , from new outsourcing wins .
[P_90] wins are positioning altera [P_91] a recovery when the inventory is gone but the bigger question is how [P_96] that take and what is the slope of that recovery .
demand during the summer will determine the direction of the [P_93] change .
in our view , some of these stocks have begun to discount a fundamental recovery that is not yet fully substantiated by market conditions ; however , the intermediate - term outlook has become somewhat [P_911] and ( perhaps more importantly ) current valuations of certain stocks in our coverage universe still leave room for incremental upside appreciation [P_919] over the [P_920] or more , particularly after the modest pull - back that the group experienced over the last week and a half .
we believe that the spx and ndx [P_92] a [P_93] cuts .
while we believe the company continues to effectively manage its business and have a high level of confidence in ceo paul charron , we recognize that the uncertainty in senior management is unsettling and believe [P_911] of the situation [P_913] a catalyst for the shares .

[P_90] those that showed up yesterday .
casey was a first - round draft choice and shaun [P_93] have been if he had been healthy .
tubbs had 5.5 sacks and 10 other tackles for losses and showed [P_94] promise for [P_95] .
he and most of the other defensive tackles are [P_93] and [P_93] than hampton and rogers , [P_95] front four show a lot of [P_99] in pass rushing .
the tackles this year wo n't be as [P_92] against the run as hampton and rogers , who were run - stoppers deluxe , but they [P_98] , and , lets face it , the best teams on the ut regular - [P_915] schedule are geared to passing .
but let 's [P_91] some of the walk - on kickers the ut staff rounded up after the spring problems surfaced can kick field goals .
if they ca n't , and if this team is as [P_93] as it has a [P_95] be , brown [P_97] himself in the same boat as florida state coach bobby bowden , who lost a couple of national championships in the 1990s because he did n't have guys [P_917] make a chip - shot field goal when the game was on the line .

the doctors told me i [P_91] out again in three or four weeks
and , if i [P_91] any games , [P_92] n't [P_93] than the first one or two .
the longhorns were already thin at defensive end , and they [P_93] critically short if mcclintock is out for a significant period of time .
he did a tremendous job making the transition to defensive end ( from linebacker ) in the spring and is a guy we [P_97] this season .
he said he wanted to go to a school where he has a better [P_94] log some playing time .
if the injury does cost mcclintock significant playing time , the coaches [P_94] some moves to [P_95] depth .

bob - [P_90] consider [P_92] meeting with the cftc staff to get their [P_95] this issue .
bill has asked [P_91] him [P_92] legislative history or [P_94] staff directly
these are not [P_91] solutions , but they are the best i can think of , especially given that the ag [P_97] roll out softs products on eol in [P_910] couple of months or so .
; i [P_90] analysis is well - reasoned .
[P_90] , i can not find a definition of agricultural commodity , although the term is used elsewhere , see sec .
for those transactions [P_91] be traded with eligible commercial entities on [P_94] trading facility under subsection ( 3 ) , there is a notice requirement .
therefore if enron wishes to conduct such business , a [P_93] way to raise the issue with the cftc would be [P_97] such a notice and then [P_99] it to the staff for prior review .
absent a cftc regulation , [P_91] not come for [P_93] , the [P_94] to deal with the issue as definitively [P_97] would [P_98] raise it with the staff directly .
otherwise we [P_90] more research [P_92] if there is any legislative history to shed light on the issue .
[P_90] either to [P_93] staff or research the legislative history ( to the extent it is available ) .
[P_90] vince - i 'll give him a try .

i am [P_90] our [P_91] this week
also , there are probably [P_91] , [P_92] restricted lists and the like , [P_95] apply to [P_96] .
[P_90] have time to enjoy the holidays .
as [P_90] , i have finished drafts for the two engage entities [P_94] e - mail same to [P_96] week .
vince , [P_90] your [P_91] .
[P_90] plan to reconsider [P_94] in the second half of this year .
wow - what a [P_91] friday morning surprise [P_92] from my old friend bobby .

[P_90] are not available this [P_92] to participate on [P_94] associate [P_95] dolores muzzy as well .
as a practical matter , i believe that it [P_93] difficult to maintain [P_94] inventory of confidential information on an [P_97] .
i do agree that we [P_91] to put some protocols in [P_93] regard to how enron handles different levels of confidential information ( including trade secrets ) .
for example , trading positions and curves [P_92] have one standard for access and disclosure , while personnel [P_96] have a different one .
the [P_90] is that [P_92] set the guidelines [P_94] on a periodic basis [P_96] sure that they are followed , rather than create updated inventories .
i would not view this type of approach as requiring much , if any , [P_95] outside counsel .

i am [P_90] will be [P_92] length at [P_93] intrastate pipeline association meeting on june 22 ( to be hosted by redmond at enron's / hpl 's offices ) .
if this version passes , [P_91] have one [P_93] year to [P_94] a voluntary emissions reduction permit ( verp ) .
[P_90] it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly cindy morphew of txoga and celina romero of atingp - that [P_98] as though we will get [P_910] to get these facilities permitted without having to use today 's bact .
if that attempt is successful , [P_92] to [P_93] a verp [P_94] gone on september 1 .
i am not certain [P_91] will continue to exist .
in addition , i 've appended [P_92] on 10-year old bact for gas - fired ic engines and turbines that [P_97] are trying to get a verp now .
if while processing the application , the commission determines that [P_93] information is necessary [P_94] or to take final action on the application , the commission [P_99] the information and set a reasonable deadline for a response .
the owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may [P_93] a permit to operate the facility under this section .
the commission [P_90] issue an existing facility [P_92] permit for some or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site .
the commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate [P_96] required than in other areas , but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate may be required in any area .
because control technology for nox emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is [P_94] , it is doubtful if significant control [P_97] achieved through the permit system at this time .
i believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the trncc [P_95] to [P_96] of guidelines for 10-year bact for grandfathered engines and turbines [P_910] in the verp program .
grandfathered engines and turbines that [P_91] to be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram [P_95] will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review .
grandfathered engines and turbines that are not [P_92] controlled to the 2 - 8 gram range [P_96] permittable under a verp if there [P_98] data to validate the old ( pre - modification ) [P_912] ( post - modification ) emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions [P_918] achieved .
also needed [P_90] a representation of the cost of the controls and even though [P_95] modifications are [P_96] , [P_96] cost is prohibitive .
i [P_90] all of this is [P_92] .
[P_90] .
, you asked for an example of what [P_92] consider " significant emission reductions " [P_95] in a case - by - case review when the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level [P_913] not be achieved .
also [P_90] the case - by - case review would [P_93] a representation of what the cost of the controls [P_97] with a discussion of why the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level [P_913] not be achieved .
[P_90] be due [P_91] limitations such as no [P_93] controls or modifications are [P_95] , [P_95] identify cost in dollars per [P_98] of nox controlled to show that even though [P_911] modifications [P_912] , the cost is prohibitive .
after my first read , [P_91] .
at that time older rich burn engines [P_92] been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g / hp - hr limit for nox .
the 10 year old bact [P_91] these engines and turbines will have to be done on a case - by - [P_97] just [P_98] would have done 10 years ago .
we [P_90] this [P_91] your members to decide which engines they [P_94] either exempt or permit under the verp program and submit their letters of intent to participate in the verp program by december 7 , 2000 .
for each engine or turbine , [P_92] a , table 29 or 31 as applicable , and other technical information [P_97] support the standard exemption claim .
for engines that [P_91] be authorized by a verp permit , [P_93] identify each engine by unit number , epn , air quality [P_97] , and plant name , [P_910] of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a result of participation in the verp program .
when the verp applications are submitted , information [P_92] provided to show that nox emissions will [P_95] the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr range .
information showing that actual emissions reductions [P_92] achieved , even when the targeted [P_94] of 2 to 8 g / hp - hr can not be met , [P_99] staff review of the application .

a controversial issue in these proceedings has been whether the costs of transco 's twelve incrementally - priced leidy and southern [P_97] should be rolled into transco 's system - wide rates .

the pgt order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs [P_94] increase for existing shippers ; therefore , pgt had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject [P_99] shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that [P_914] absent [P_915] compression .

i [P_90] to give the idea a test drive with perhaps the most provocative and difficult and potentially [P_96] player in the drama , brenda anderson of bpa .
i [P_90] to get your take on the following kind of big picture enron policy on wspp approach .
every amendment that has been made in the past two years [P_93] agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous [P_97] serious lawyer to argue that we are [P_910] off with two agreements , one that is almost like the other one .
the wspp should be focusing on more boondoggles and more [P_93] like [P_94] for rto west , dealing with the emerging california [P_98] , and open access in oregon and nevada .
therefore , this policy [P_91] let our marketers praise the wspp for being a [P_94] organization , but at the same time , advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more [P_913] .
rosman should say : enron loves the wspp , it has done a [P_94] with the contract reformation , that task is done , we now should [P_99] on to [P_910] better tasks .

there have been [P_91] to accounting standards [P_92] which , by the time they have all been implemented [P_96] have brought japanese accounting standards broadly into line with international norms .
hence there has been much talk about [P_92] to unwind these cross shareholdings without further depressing the market .
[P_90] get the banks at least part way out of [P_93] - term crunch they are under from greater disclosure requirements , but with the japanese economy continuing to deteriorate , with serious consequences for the size of the non - performing loans problem , the japanese financial system [P_917] have to face the music [P_919] .
ifr - november 17 , 2001 standard [P_92] aimed at clarifying which company should serve as reference entity [P_96] default swaps in [P_97] of a demerger or other structural change , such as a consolidation , [P_912] put [P_913] by the international [P_915] derivatives association this week .
while the successor issue has been debated since the break - up of national power of the uk , the imminent break - ups of at&t and bt into smaller entities has underscored the [P_911] for [P_912] .
no successor [P_90] appointed if the original reference entity continues to exist .
it came almost exactly a year after a similar decision by the most active new [P_95] dealers to drop restructuring as a standard credit [P_98] us corporate default swaps .
[P_90] definition was agreed at the end of april and released in [P_94] , but liquidity in the default swap market was hit in the early months of the year by the uncertainty caused by the debate .
the issue of obligation acceleration had not been a [P_93] concern for dealers until moody 's indicated that it was uncomfortable with the inclusion of what it viewed as a " soft " credit event in the default swaps that back credit - linked [P_914] collateralised debt obligations .
[P_90] trigger exercise on a default swap , when there was still a [P_94] the covenant [P_96] made whole before the fundamental default event - failure to make a debt payment - had taken place .
derivatives dealing heads in [P_91] york echo this sentiment and point out that buyers of credit protection will [P_96] request that obligation acceleration is included as a feature in a swap .
the international [P_90] derivatives association last week [P_92] fpml.org , a non - profit industry body dedicated to [P_97] a business information exchange standard for electronic dealing and processing of financial derivative transactions .
in theory , liquidity should [P_91] a boost from a [P_93] greater [P_94] .
no decision on linking fpml 's transaction standards with isda [P_93] netting agreements has been made yet , but such a [P_97] is likely in [P_98] .
[P_90] forces [P_90] raise [P_92] of fpml , but awareness of its [P_95] is not a problem said lynn .
fpml.org 's architectural [P_91] group , and its [P_92] covering interest rate , foreign exchange and equity derivatives , [P_96] to exist as sub - groups [P_99] 's new fpml committee .
fpml standards currently exist for [P_91] derivative products [P_93] rate agreements .

the [P_90] friday and would include an immediate [P_93] about dlrs 1.5 billion from chevrontexaco corp. , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , the source said on condition of anonymity .
chevrontexaco would [P_90] dlrs 1 billion upon [P_93] of the deal , though the source said talks [P_96] still fall apart .
neither [P_90] reached for comment on friday .
the deal [P_90] include an immediate injection of $ 1.5 billion for enron from chevrontexaco corp. , which holds a 26.5 percent stake in dynegy , and an injection [P_910] $ 1 billion when the deal [P_912] , the journal said .
[P_90] basically quadruple dynegy 's [P_92] with a very accretive earnings contribution , too .
suits a scheduling conference is set for jan. 25 and a judge will then determine if all the lawsuits [P_96] consolidated and if the case [P_98] certified as a class action lawsuit .
the fate of [P_91] turn , lawyers said , on whether it tried to cover up the transactions and their impact or whether it has sincerely tried to expose them and fix the damage .
the deal , likely to [P_91] later on friday , calls for dynegy [P_94] 0.27 of its shares for each enron share , the journal said , citing people familiar with the matter .
the deal will also include an immediate injection of $ 1.5 billion for enron from chevrontexaco corp. , which holds a 26.5 percent stake in dynegy , with a similar injection of $ 1 billion when the deal [P_912] , the journal said .
but enron has [P_91] to get people to change their way of thinking about how bandwidth has traded in the past and how it [P_98] in [P_99] , he said .
i think they realized there was n't going to be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , or ... they realized they were n't going [P_99] ( it ) [P_911] .
some [P_90] to dynegy to rescue the bandwidth market just as it is expected to rescue enron .
i [P_90] 've been much more willing [P_92] this market [P_94] along , " he said .
( enron ) thought they had [P_92] for the way the world [P_94] and the carriers would have to accept it .
while the carrier ca n't hedge its entire position in the bandwidth market , it can structure deals so it is n't giving away services that customers would [P_99] to pay for .
it [P_90] it has the proper credit procedures in place .
if enron disappears and the bandwidth market does [P_92] , there [P_93] more [P_94] the survivors , he said .
the first [P_90] enron 's controversial indian [P_92] , but [P_94] the second [P_96] was abruptly stopped in june following a bitter dispute between enron and the local utility , the plant 's sole buyer .
in that case , [P_91] be forced to terminate the contract , and file for damages in the international court of arbitration in london .
based [P_90] trading prices on [P_92] stock exchange , that would value enron at about $ 9.50 a share .
enron has been scrambling for days to line up [P_93] financing from a prominent outside investor and has been [P_96] with private - equity firms and power - trading companies .
late last month , fitch put enron on [P_92] a [P_93] downgrade , while another , standard & poor 's , changed enron 's credit outlook [P_99] from stable .
sources told reuters on thursday that dynegy 's board was waiting for word from major credit rating agencies to determine whether acquiring enron would result in a [P_99] downgrade of its debt .
dynegy has asked for an expedited review from moody 's and standard & poor 's on how the merger [P_96] its ratings .
enron drew down its bank credit facilities in order to shore up near - term liquidity , but faces significant debt maturities over [P_97] term , as well as the potential for increased margin requirements from counterparties of its wholesale trading operation .
however , the rating agency concludes that the [P_92] not [P_93] to retain investment grade characteristics .
moody 's [P_90] enron 's [P_92] to [P_93] its [P_94] capital position .
the two companies are " [P_91] to reaching a deal ... they [P_94] an announcement very [P_96] " , said cnbc 's david faber .
yesterday , the companies confirmed they were in talks over a [P_93] tie - up but said they [P_96] refrain from making [P_97] statements until a [P_99] agreement is reached .
and , i guess all [P_91] say is you [P_93] united states than many other places in the world too have a viable job and to [P_910] some return .
dynegy 's board is waiting for word from the major credit rating agencies to determine whether the acquisition would result in a [P_97] downgrade of enron 's debt .
a deal with dynegy [P_91] ` ` end up with a capital [P_94] that would be [P_95] over time , and [P_97] look at that liquidity structure . ' ' on dynegy 's credit ratings : when people talk about dynegy , they should [P_915] the ` ` baa2 ' ' rating , which belongs to dynegy holdings .
it [P_90] difficult to make it work . '
[P_90] have [P_91] on [P_92] - term . ' ' ` ` the markets [P_95] to function but there [P_97] be less churn , that 's transactions between traders .

key discussion points 1 ) [P_91] competition and supply chain in general
there has been a lot of discussion and controversy surrounding market share and competitive wins regarding the [P_95] market and the three major vendors ( itwo , manu and sap ) .
the best gauge we have for [P_92] market share is license revenue comparisons for the last few quarters .
on the [P_90] , manu has better vertical diversification with a [P_94] transportation management and has won deals of late in high tech .
what we do believe is that when demand for supply chain software returns both companies [P_95] rebound .
however , given its vertical [P_91] , [P_92] argue that itwo has more upside [P_95] if high tech and industrial rebound [P_97] than other vertical areas .
here are a few high level [P_92] the sector in general .

we 'd [P_90] to pull [P_91] cable to handle the approximately 150 people that [P_94] to [P_95] the floor .
[P_90] decide so to use the floor [P_92] get this done within a couple [P_95] at most .
we 'd [P_90] to [P_91] several people in each office to fit everyone into [P_95] .
that means to make [P_91] as is hpl would have to remain on our network and [P_95] us for telecom service via our nortel switch during the stay in three allen since there [P_911] nowhere for aep to put servers or switches on the floor without any major build out .
[P_90] news is that keith dziadek and his team have figured out a way [P_95] the eol connection [P_96] have minimal [P_99] eol .

sme lenders ' initial concerns included the steepness of basel 's credit risk weighting [P_94] the internal ratings - based ( irb ) approach , its insistence that expected loss provisions should be made in [P_912] typical unexpected loss provisions , confusion over which sme loans [P_916] included under the retail approach , and the extent to which physical collateral [P_920] used as a risk mitigant .
the basel committee has since issued a paper , ' [P_93] modifications to the committee 's proposals ' , which outlines current thinking within the committee and indicates that it [P_910] key concessions to sme lenders .
we have got [P_91] maturities , this would put german banks at [P_94] competitive disadvantage compared with other countries , " says winkler .
what kills a bank is deterioration of value , and it has got to [P_94] a lot of things on the books , so you ca n't wait [P_99] default , " said a basel committee member .
he said his hands were all but tied on the maturity debate , and confirmed that the german side [P_96] prepared to scupper basel ii 's timetable should a deal fail to [P_911] .
i have [P_90] imagining that [P_91] introduce basel ii in europe and not have a level playing field on a g-10 basis .
while hofmann said the matter was " very serious " , he remained [P_94] all sides [P_95] a solution .
asked if the us [P_91] agree such a concession , he added , " i [P_95] n't say that [P_96] , but [P_98] the whole package .
another area of [P_91] compromise is to allow banks with loan maturities of less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment , while banks with loans of more than three years [P_911] capped at the three - year level - as factored into the current proposed standardised credit approach .
how big [P_90] the [P_91] effect [P_92] ?
the paper proposes that a function based on the relationship between asset correlation and size [P_95] added to the irb risk - weight [P_98] methodology based on the relationship between asset correlation and [P_911] default .
retail businesses and wholesale businesses [P_91] similar turnover , but the characteristics and the [P_95] would manage them in risk terms [P_97] quite different , " says colin jennings , senior manager , non - retail related risk at lloyds tsb , the uk 's third largest bank .
the committee believes banks [P_91] put aside [P_92] expected losses [P_93] to the current practice of making capital charges against unexpected losses - credit risk .
we fear that [P_91] lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for german banks because of tax regulations , so we [P_97] much against covering expected losses with regulatory capital .
[P_90] to use isda resources which will speed up the implementation of version 2.0 and [P_96] of version 3.0 , ' he says . '
the standards committee ended up doing a lot of the administration [P_93] run the fpml symposiums , and we [P_96] leverage off isda conferences ( [P_99] symposiums ) .
[P_90] have [P_91] on [P_92] then converting that into xml , [P_94] has a natural [P_96] isda , " says meinel , operating from inside isda [P_910] of fpml [P_912] aligned with [P_913] of [P_914] as it comes along .
strain robert pickel , isda 's chief executive officer , says the merger will allow members of fpml [P_96] on [P_97] .
we envision adding [P_91] staff , and we [P_93] to find the extra funding needed through due - based revenues ' says pickel .
creating fpml is [P_91] as the isda [P_92] agreement , because [P_94] strengthen [P_95] for [P_96] negotiation .
brickell says blackbird was the first company [P_92] fpml confirmations to its customers , and he believes isda will accelerate the adoption of 2.0 and [P_98] fpml [P_99] cover more kinds of transactions more quickly .

leading european and us banks [P_91] how new rules on capital adequacy will operate , raising the possibility that final proposals from the basle committee [P_99] delayed .
they are also asking [P_91] information on the way operational risk - unexpected losses - [P_95] treated , and [P_97] on aspects of securitisation , counterparty risk and disclosure .
the letter points out that in a number [P_92] areas the basle committee 's second consultation document has either come [P_97] proposals or indicated that final proposals are to come .
" taken together these greener areas will have a critical [P_93] the outcome of the proposals for individual firms and the industry as a whole , " the letter says .
we are very concerned that if the calibration is not done properly , [P_94] go up and [P_96] have a serious effect on the economy , " the european banking federation said .

while [P_90] progress is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk management and regulatory oversight of highly leveraged institutions ( hli ) , credit providers need [P_99] the measurement of credit exposures , a global banking watchdog said friday .
although a separate study [P_91] to set out a basis for [P_94] public disclosure of financial risks has [P_96] , actual progress toward introducing mandatory public disclosure requirements for hlis and hedge funds has [P_912] , the fsf report said .
at the same time , improvements have been made by senior management in terms of reporting on hli exposures , general standards of credit analysis , due [P_99] , the fsf reported .
and foreign exchange market [P_91] agreed to a set of so - called good practice guidelines for foreign exchange trading .
[P_90] address concerns that large and concentrated hli positions [P_93] to materially influence market dynamics in [P_97] medium - [P_98] open economies , according to the fsf report .
while [P_90] is being made in addressing [P_92] in legal documentation practices , it has proven difficult to achieve [P_96] the consistency , where appropriate , between different industry standards , the report added .
while good progress is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk , management and regulatory oversight of so - called highly leveraged institutions ( hlis ) , credit providers [P_910] to make [P_911] the measurement of credit exposures , the global banking watchdog said .
disclosure of information by hlis to banks and other credit providers has [P_94] in terms of both quality and quantity , the bank for international settlements said last week .
the banks said they feared the legislation would discourage international investors from trading in [P_94] kong shares , undermining the sar 's position as an international market .
however , they [P_91] to do so under the new law as it expands the disclosure requirement from shares to include derivatives .
the stricter disclosure requirement [ in the bill compared with ] international practices [P_94] to reduce manipulation activities , " she said .
[P_90] netting provisions [P_91] a wider [P_92] otc products has been a priority for the international swaps [P_96] association and the bond market association ( bma ) since the mid1990s .
in two high - profile reports in 1999 by the president 's [P_94] group - one [P_95] - term capital management and one on otc derivatives regulation - us regulators acknowledged that [P_911] netting law [P_912] reduce systemic risk .
the definition of swaps has been stretched to cover [P_93] rate agreements , [P_94] foreign exchange contracts and other instruments .
friction developed between [P_91] and securities contracts with regard to netting across them , " says dan cunningham , a partner at allen & overy [P_98] isda 's legal counsel .
[P_90] have [P_91] collateral and an array [P_92] for safe harbour " netting and settlement [P_96] much [P_97] under [P_99] bill , he adds .
the three groups contended that because a wide [P_92] can affect the market price of a futures contract , the imposition of ' " any continuing duty to furnish all price information and [P_911] all facts likely [P_913] the market price would be so burdensome as to be unreasonable .
the narrow scope of a broker 's duty to a nondiscretionary account [P_94] applies fully to a futures broker , the groups wrote .
[P_90] originally used for hedging in commodity markets became a large - scale financial phenomenon .
at [P_90] of 2000 , outstanding otc derivatives amounted to $ 2,800bn according to the bank for international settlements , or just over half the value of [P_99] international debt securities .
[P_90] there be a limit to the efficiency gains [P_93] be wrung from the global financial system through innovation ?
[P_90] instruments such as credit derivatives are growing fast , although central bankers worry about their robustness in a downturn .
while portfolio regulations for private pensions [P_92] regulatory arbitrage [P_93] derivatives , the scope for innovation is less obvious than [P_97] to floating exchange rates and financial liberalisation .
but only a visceral optimist [P_91] assume that financial innovation [P_93] at the pace of the past quarter - century .
airlines , especially those concentrated in a particular hub , [P_93] weather derivatives more actively since inclement weather [P_96] prompt many more delays than they are used to , notes claudio ribeiro , head of [P_912] development , weather risk management group , enron .
weather has n't presented itself to - date to be sufficiently fungible for us to build a broad market on , yet it 's a pretty big market nonetheless , " adds robert levin , senior vice - president , [P_913] and control development , at [P_915] exchange .
since september 1997 , when the first weather derivatives trade occurred , the market [P_94] an estimated 4,500 weather transactions worth more than us$ 6bn .
through the otc market , [P_91] kind of [P_93] , " ribeiro says .
to compensate , a realistic hourly weather simulation engine is [P_93] replicate thousands of multi - regional weather [P_96] , said rookley .
initial [P_90] were that the treasury 's move a fortnight ago would [P_94] the societies to embrace synthetic securitisations - and thus [P_97] fuel credit derivative market growth .
on [P_90] examination , those [P_91] seem to be fading .
also , the assets [P_91] for synthetic securitisation are relatively small , " said chris carman , a vice - president within jp morgan 's structured products group in london .
while some smaller building societies [P_91] candidates for synthetic securitisations because they are cheaper and require less documentation than traditional securitisations , others [P_98] not have concentrations large enough to warrant the use of synthetic securitisations .
[P_90] building societies that may be viable candidates for synthetic securitisations , [P_94] not [P_95] to build the infrastructure required to otherwise actively trade credit derivatives , noted janet tavakoli , executive director and head of structuring [P_913] for credit derivatives at westlb in london .
building societies [P_90] to be securitising an asset pool of more than e500 m to warrant entering into the transaction because the cost of [P_98] these transactions is quite sizeable , other industry officials said .
a building society 's [P_91] use credit derivatives hinges [P_93] it fits on a bsc - created spectrum that assigns eligibility based on criteria such as sufficient [P_99] using derivatives and adequate systems to capture and handle credit derivatives business .
an institution ranked in the middle of the five - tier spectrum [P_94] to apply and [P_95] a strong case for why it should [P_98] to use credit derivatives .
building societies are most [P_91] to use synthetic securitisations in [P_93] areas as a way to transfer out the risk related to a [P_98] or for transferring the risk of higher - weighted assets , industry officials said .
[P_90] building societies to use credit derivatives occurred because the bsc 's regulatory jurisdiction over building societies is being transferred to the fsa in november .
according to some industry officials , building societies ' current practice of using insurance to reduce borrower risk may turn out to [P_97] prompts them to enter the credit derivatives market .
theoretically , credit derivatives [P_91] the place of mortgage guarantees .
the societies have been [P_91] use only [P_92] and foreign exchange derivatives .
it has been a [P_91] quarter for the big us energy trading firms .
we continue to [P_91] new generating capacity , which [P_93] inventory of [P_94] capacity [P_95] low - cost , high - value [P_98] in a highly volatile market - place , " skilling said .
audit david yeres , a partner specialising in derivatives law at clifford chance rogers & wells [P_95] york , says : " a number of our clients have asked us to do a contract audit in response to the scrutiny management is giving to these exposures and the adequacy of [P_917] .
he adds : " [P_91] very hard at upgrading our contracts , we 're analysing our contracts in light of market [P_97] our [P_98] california .
clifford [P_90] 's yeres expects that i the california crisis will accelerate acceptance of more - sophisticated master agreements .
for instance , [P_91] set up [P_92] of structure using collateral threshold amounts or guarantees , or any type of [P_97] mechanism .
i know a lot of the suppliers [P_92] quite a bit of [P_94] language for transactions with the california department of water ,
however , the concepts contained in the eel master that are similar to those in the isda master agreement . which has stood the [P_98] time and been proven in court .
isda itself has an initiative under way that , when complete , [P_94] benefit energy marketers operating in california .
it is [P_90] ways [P_91] its master agreement to cover both physical and financial transactions .
haedicke , who is [P_91] board member and chair of the energy [P_94] products committee [P_95] this , says : " [P_98] be a much [P_99] world [P_910] a way to use the isda master for both physically and financially settled transactions , and find a way to net across physical and financial collateral collateral is another area being scrutinised in the wake of the california crisis .
under the concept of " adequate assurances " [P_92] , a party to a [P_95] with " reasonable " grounds to be insecure about the ability of its counterparty to fulfill its responsibilities [P_912] demand performance assurance such as collateral .
[P_90] , some energy traders [ have ] [P_93] to terminate and close - out transactions at an earlier stage than others using the so - called ' early termination events '
the costs and [P_91] costs of [P_92] this debacle should ensure that the lessons of the california crisis are long remembered .
isma said these bodies needed [P_91] a constructive way to provide a more harmonised security settlement environment in europe to " substantially reduce " the number of failed transactions .
the organisation 's intervention will increase pressure on europe 's 26 different clearing and settlement systems [P_95] up co - operation so costs [P_98] reduced .

[P_90] , as i illustrated , is [P_93] to accept a [P_94] of delta positions , prices and vols and [P_98] to [P_99] the ' silver mine ' position into these inputs .
i do not think that [P_91] simply take the net silver content of the mine and then make some assumptions about [P_97] and price .
to do this properly i [P_91] to understand fully how the deal is priced as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in mtm in [P_99] and that is essentially what var is supposed to [P_913] .

already , leading silicon valley companies are threatening to build their [P_93] - generation chip fabrication plants elsewhere , probably in texas , which has a surplus of generating capacity , a move that would [P_911] undermine mr. davis 's stewardship .

at the end of the call , pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible , but at the end he said that he thought [P_910] probably work through a number of the issues
we said that [P_91] be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts [P_96] about and that [P_98] then " [P_99] notes .
pirog said cdwr [P_91] willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an [P_95] adversely affects cdwr 's ability to perform under the contract , most particularly its ability to pay for power .
( such an event likely [P_91] a ca legislature or regulatory generated change ) .
right that has been offered , it was discussed that [P_93] be structured in such a way that epmi [P_96] walk from the deal ( without receiving or paying a termination payment ) up until a date certain ( september 1 and september 30 were mentioned by me as [P_916] , although pirog said that other suppliers had a [P_920] window )
pirog said he thought cdwr [P_91] on that .
however , he said cdwr [P_91] willing to consider having a downgrade [P_94] a " no ld walk right " for epmi and perhaps an event justifying epmi in suspending deliveries .
in other words , a downgrade [P_92] treated like an event of default , but no termination payment [P_96] owed and epmi would have [P_99] to suspend performance .
however , when asked about the idea of a cross default out w / out a termination payment , he stated that he [P_97] that further with cdwr .
my sense is that [P_91] need to get [P_93] it in general .
i [P_90] that the situs issue [P_92] a big one for richard sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise .

also , he said it was a possibility that the california attorney general would issue the [P_95] the bonds , [P_97] possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from hawkins .
pirog stated that [P_91] covenants we [P_92] are conceptually okay with him , but [P_95] to [P_96] internally with cdwr .
pirog said he would follow [P_91] cdwr on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information .

in order to minimize [P_91] risk and the time required to achieve a [P_94] cash flow , the client company [P_97] a multi phase strategic production plan [P_99]
phase i [P_90] show a profit within seven months of initial funding .
phase ii is somewhat [P_91] than phase i [P_92] employ its own [P_94] proprietary technology and a separate geographical facility location .
[P_90] ii can [P_91] within about twelve to fourteen month after funding and the [P_95] show a profit about two months after startup .
the recent dramatic rise in energy prices in the us has caused some generators of the spent solvents that [P_96] the feedstock for this facility to [P_99] these streams for fuel .
a reevaluation of this situation is underway at the [P_93] and the decision as to [P_95] of this phase [P_97] made in late first quarter of 2001 .
[P_90] , although much more capital intensive than [P_93] , has been separated from phase iv for several reasons : 1 .
in contrast to this , the permits for the reclamation of the hazardous chlorinated solvents , phase iv , will require between ten and eighteen months if all [P_99] .
the technology to be employed and the absence of corrosive compounds in the processes [P_94] iii [P_95] allow the equipment and piping to be fabricated out of common carbon steel rather than the exotic alloys , which will [P_913] required for [P_914] , chlorinated solvent reclamation process .
the handling of the petroleum feedstocks and products [P_92] iii are much simpler than the chlorinated solvent feedstocks [P_96] iv .
[P_90] iv will [P_91] a [P_91] the us while phase v [P_94] in the caribbean .
[P_90] includes another individual with in excess of 25 years of financial [P_95] banking , investment banking and [P_97] .
from the point of the first financial draw approximately 6 to 7 months [P_94] be required to construct the phase i plant , go through startup [P_98] commence full - scale production .
while this gas is not [P_91] for sale as " pipeline " quality gas it is [P_95] for the production of ammonia .
the [P_90] of patent protection for these technologies is being explored with one patent already filed .
the client company believes that freight considerations alone [P_92] sufficient cost differential to [P_94] it can successfully sell its 50,000 tons per year of product into the local market .
[P_90] ii operation will face [P_92] competition because we have been [P_94] to identify only one dedicated facility that is doing work similar to what the client [P_99] .
this market is expected to grow about 2 % per year for [P_94] .
( the numbers are solid to use at [P_92] .
in the loan amount , we have [P_92] pre - funding cost ) asset value of the client company w / facilities technology - within 18 months of initial funding
number 1 & 2 , above , can currently [P_93] from uop and phillips petroleum , for example , for about a million dollars per year ( royalty or technology fee ) each .

i really just [P_91] alert [P_92] product , especially the physical steel team .
we estimate that [P_91] should [P_92] on or before 10 31 01 .
[P_90] the relevant commercial , legal and environmental [P_93] the respective [P_94] managers [P_95] personnel , enron recommends that the following courses of action be undertaken : 1 .
assuming that pgl assumes the role of buyer under the terms of the land purchase agreement executed between pgl and air liquide on 4/11/2000 and pgl plans [P_99] to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing , perc and pgl should immediately begin [P_913] of the documents necessary to achieve the icc approval of any [P_917] transfer ( sale , lease , or alternative structure ) of the torrence south parcel from pgl to torrence power llc .
this recommendation is based upon the belief that although the torrence south parcel does hold [P_95] to perc and enron as a project [P_98] site , [P_99] viability and risk / reward profile of the commercial [P_912] has not yet been sufficiently finalized .
the site ( in combination with the calumet project ) represents an integral component of [P_95] a commercial solution to the mission energy / comed 500 mw " in - city " regulatory obligation to the city of the chicago .
the factors contributing to the [P_91] perc and enron not to [P_94] to closing on 6/26/00 are listed [P_96] :
the incomplete status of the overall commercial development [P_92] associated with the torrence south parcel .
d. perc and enron 's desire to maintain [P_92] to minimize development costs while [P_95] developing the commercial [P_96] associated value proposition prior to executing an icc - approved land [P_911] pgl to torrence power llc .
the south parcel represents a potential power plant [P_92] site upon which perc and enron [P_95] to conduct due [P_97] activities .
perc and [P_90] risk mitigation strategies including land options , environmental indemnifications , and other [P_96] which protect their respective assets and [P_98] economic viability of a [P_910] on the torrence south parcel .
perc development personnel have estimated that the icc [P_92] require up to 6 months ( the transfer of the calumet parcel was " fast - tracked " and took 3 months to achieve icc [P_912] ) .
this risk [P_90] viability of an ' 01 in - service date for a torrence power llc [P_96] .

although [P_90] be the last ease this year , recent market moves [P_94] that the fed has done enough to support [P_97] a recovery in h2 .
it turns out that what they really were [P_92] see was something [P_94] a formal biological [P_96] ( ba ) for cs 3 and cs 4 , not a biological survey report [P_911] provided .

mark , i am [P_91] report that [P_92] extremely hard to collect all of the information that has [P_97] ( and then some ) for purposes of [P_910] due diligence visit .
while [P_90] current [P_91] awano and seguchi we touched upon [P_94] reaction to our valuation and came upon a fundamental realization .
recognizing that enron [P_91] to [P_92] the assumptions we have utilized i still [P_95] share some fundamental [P_97] order to put this value into [P_910] .
in other words , if we were to flip [P_93] at financial close [P_94] at least this much .
looked at [P_90] , discounting the npv back to 2001 at 15 % results in a current npv of $ 558 million , or more than $ 34 per current encom share !
[P_90] hard to believe but we [P_93] that your due diligence will bear them out .
[P_90] just these two [P_91] placing a ridiculously low 20 % probability [P_94] on them [P_96] the $ 3 per share of cash on our balance sheet gives you nearly $ 20 per share current value .
this is without considering oita or any of the other many [P_93] are [P_94] on .
if enron , with all of its [P_92] resources [P_93] , were to fully support encom [P_95] two [P_96] believe that the [P_98] their [P_99] quite high .
( we have been receiving [P_91] support from the global lng group by the way )
this is also why i [P_91] that we focus our immediate attention on these two projects [P_95] perhaps the oita [P_97] .
i [P_90] agree that reaching a conclusion as quick [P_94] is in all shareholders interests .
my main concern continues to be that the current infighting between [P_93] and e power has limited enron 's ability to recognize 1 ) the quality and [P_99] capabilities of the employees of e power and 2 ) the [P_913] that has [P_914] through the nearly 2 years of systematic and comparative analysis of all of [P_919] greenfield sites in japan as well as the [P_920] respect to brownfield developments .
within [P_90] six [P_91] to take off of the market nearly three quarters of the most attractive [P_97] sites in [P_98] leaving little for the late comers to the japanese market .
we continue to [P_91] a way [P_93] our mutual energies on building value in [P_96] market rather than on non - productive bickering and turf wars .

while consumer groups may complain about high rates and [P_93] insiders may project a darker [P_95] residential customers , other experts saythe current situation is just a matter of a newly deregulated industry experiencing growing pains .

an industry comment period [P_91] global capital rules dubbed " basel 2 " ends on thursday , but [P_96] will just [P_97] for banks calculating how the sweeping [P_910] affect their businesses .
one reason for the haste is that the basel committee on banking supervision [P_94] new rules worries an industry stalemate [P_97] delay adoption of the badly - [P_99] rules in [P_910] jurisdictions .
unofficial dialogues [P_90] continue for a long while .
banks complain basel 2 's calibration formulae , as spelled out in a draft published in january , penalise the irb approach , saying set - asides for risky corporates , for example , [P_911] higher than what is called for by a standardised approach applied for less sophisticated banks .
one fear is that [P_91] lead small and mid - [P_93] banks using the standardised approach to wind [P_96] a disproportionately [P_97] exposure to riskier borrowers .
supervisors are expected [P_91] out [P_92] , however , and are expected to take into account data collected by the basel committee under a quantitative [P_99] study ( www.bis.org ) .

by kathleen [P_90] dubbed virtual portfolios , risk measurement services that include a ' what - if ' scenario along with the more traditional kind of risk analysis are gaining in importance .
deutsche 's ' what - if positions change ' enhancement , released to clients in mid - [P_95] , includes features to determine [P_97] in value at risk ( var ) , tracking error and surplus - at - risk resulting from a variety of hypothetical situations .
managers who [P_90] use of the client risk reporting [P_93] would have a [P_94] whether a particular [P_96] correlate a fund to an index , for example .
the current var analysis tools have already been mastered by the fund community , which is now [P_95] better predictors of risk .
var is tied to a particular probability at present and fails to capture [P_94] an index , for example , said guillaume blacher , senior managing director , pricing advisory and risk management .
more managers want [P_91] with the numbers , rather than have a single number that comes out once a day , " she said , referring to the benefits of scenario analysis over traditional risk measurement practices .
the hypothetical scenario tools , along with the traditional var risk measurement systems , [P_94] by fund managers in a complementary way , stated reech capital 's blacher .
hypothetical analysis tools [P_91] risk [P_92] deciphering what positions [P_94] to get back within a fund manager 's limit , he added .
the need for [P_91] more reliable scenario hedging for managers investing in equity options has been a key driver of demand for ' what - if ' scenario analysis lately .
he also credits the more educated investor [P_92] be prompting the fund manager to install better risk management and reporting systems , particularly for option based funds , as fuelling the current demand for hypothetical risk analysis .
however , the current risk measurement systems can be expensive for all but the largest trading organisations , [P_96] for start - up funds .
the fact that these virtual portfolio hypothetical analysis tools are now [P_93] is beginning [P_94] for hedge funds [P_97] up , according to imagine 's cannon .
with the right risk analysis tools , a hedge fund [P_93] up and running in a week , instead of hiring an entire it staff , he said .

while volatility levels dropped in the first [P_92] months of the year due to supply and demand [P_95] , the past month has seen volatilities begin to move up again .

the fact that vols have not risen in this way creates [P_93] those [P_95] use equity derivatives .

much of the buzz throughout the conference focused on the current president 's just - released energy task plan , a 165-page report that outlines approximately 105 steps that [P_99] administration will take to address current energy problems .
having [P_90] vice president dick cheney last evening , former president bush said he was aware that [P_96] , broad - based plan focused heavily [P_99] supply , along with secondary measures for conservation efforts .
this is an approach that the former president fully supports as he noted that " if [P_95] to lower energy prices , [P_97] to establish more supply .
meanwhile , the energy task plan released by the current president bush this morning holds few surprises but continues to spark a [P_97] of debate .
as has been the case since the [P_92] administration , the continuing criticism of the [P_96] bush plan is that it is overly specific [P_99] on new supply efforts , while remaining vague and noncommittal to conservation efforts .
[P_90] , president bush has proposed providing tax benefits to co - generation plants , which produce both heat and electricity .
however , democrats have focused more heavily on conservation efforts in their own plan , as illustrated by a series of tax incentives [P_97] consumers [P_98] energy efficient homes [P_910] hybrid gas and electric automobiles .

the only issue is whether houston has sufficient resources or are willing to pay the storage costs early , [P_96] between $ 1,200,000-?1,400,000 .

based [P_90] questions and [P_91] , we want to further clarify the double match and share [P_95] some [P_96] modifications we are making to the administration of the match .
however , the annual company matching [P_92] remain limited to 50 percent of an employee 's pre - tax contributions , up to 6 percent of eligible compensation .
the company match in effect prior to its suspension was $ .50 for each $ 1 contributed , so the maximum amount the employee would have received in company matching [P_910] would have been $ 5,500 , or half of $ 11,000 .
with the double match , the same participant [P_92] $ 1 for each $ 1 contributed , but the match will not exceed $ 5,500 .
truing up " the match for previous contributions many participants in the plan expressed concern that [P_95] the plan prior to july were not eligible for the reinstated company match .
[P_90] the end of 2002 , the matched amount falls short of the maximum level [P_95] based on the participant 's annual pre - tax [P_98] to the plan , the [P_910] " true up " their match for 2002 to ensure the company contributions equal what would have been received had the match not been suspended .
for example , if an active employee 's annual pre - tax [P_94] the [P_95] reach $ 11,000 , and on july 1 the employee has already contributed $ 7,000 , the remaining employee pre - tax contribution allowed [P_913] $ 4000 .
with the double match , the employee [P_92] $ 4,000 in company matching contributions between july and december , [P_96] be $ 1,500 short of the company [P_99]
after january 1 , 2002 any [P_92] the plan hired [P_93] - hired after january 1 , 2002 , will not [P_97] for the double match .
however , at the end of the year , they too [P_93] a true up [P_95] the maximum company match [P_97] for their annual pre - tax employee [P_910] .
the total amount of company matching contributions , including any true up , will be based [P_95] - to - date contributions up to the time the participant is terminated .
if a plan participant resigns voluntarily , he or she is not eligible for a true up , [P_96] receive the double match on any pre - tax contributions made to the plan between july 1 and his or her termination .
