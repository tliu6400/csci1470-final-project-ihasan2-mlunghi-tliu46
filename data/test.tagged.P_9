new york -(dow jones)- banks [P_91] prepared to tighten the coordination between credit risks they are exposed to [P_96] markets , as they adapt to the changing requirements of the basel accord [P_911] requirements , a federal reserve study says .
specifically , the report cites exposure to derivatives as one [P_93] broader and more tightly [P_95] models of credit risk are likely to be a [P_98] requirement for banks .
the [P_90] york federal reserve study , entitled " using credit risk [P_94] regulatory capital : issues and options , " is [P_97] publication in a forthcoming economic policy review .
when questioned , hirtle said the study 's reference to derivatives and to the [P_94] for some banks to tighten correlations among different instruments of credit risk [P_99] was n't based on specific events [P_912] in the financial sector .
for positions that involve derivatives or that otherwise depend to a material extent on market [P_95] , standards [P_96] would require integrated models of market movements and credit exposures , " the report said .
the coming [P_90] to the basel accord , planned for introduction by 2004 , aim [P_95] the way that banks globally [P_97] for risk .
nobuaki kurisu , chief fund [P_91] sumisei global investment trust management , also cited derivatives -related selling as a factor in the stock market 's plunge , and added that such selling should keep market volatility high for the time being , making institutional investors [P_915] buy .
the rush to hedge equity linked derivative bonds , which usually [P_93] in six months to one year , offer higher interest rates than ordinary bonds if the nikkei stays above a pre - determined level .
but once the nikkei drops [P_91] that level , the return at the bond 's maturity will be lower than the initial investment .
it is designed to serve as a kind of calculation device to determine who [P_94] file under chapter 13 and who can file under chapter 7 .
the bill now must wait until the senate passes its version before a conference [P_94] appointed to [P_96] differences between the two bills ( see related report in this section ) .
bonds that had previously [P_91] at a 60 handle could suddenly be tendered at par .
[P_90] insurance [P_90] swaps stipulate that in one of several [P_93] events - the declaration of a bankruptcy ; the failure to pay interest on a loan or bond , or the restructuring , repudiation or acceleration of a loan that lowers [P_914] creditworthiness of a counterparty - the buyer of [P_917] may deliver to the seller any loan or bond extending out to a predefined maturity , and receive back par value in return .
nobody wants to throw a company into bankruptcy [P_92] 's a glimmer of [P_94] a [P_95] turn around with time .
since the loan was renegotiated on the last day of the contract , bofa certainly [P_95] considered it a repaid loan , and then extended a new loan if it had [P_910] couch it in such terms , " says one dealer .
that path would have avoided the [P_92] default .
the credit derivatives market has effectively bifurcated itself into two distinctly different products , and although it has n't yet reached a critical stage , participants are concerned that this bifurcation [P_910] hurt overall market liquidity .
for example , [P_91] a bank give up its collection rights on a $ 20 million credit default swap if it had $ 1 billion in total loans [P_99] be thrown into the nonperforming category by a bankruptcy declaration ?
the conseco situation showed how a [P_92] default [P_92] trigger a credit derivatives exercise , but without the debt of the underlying company being truly hurt .
we have to establish a [P_91] standard for interdealer business , or risk less liquidity and a [P_95] of added basis risk within dealer books .
although achieving consensus will not [P_91] , kennaugh 's [P_93] is that some standard acceptable to investors , hedgers and dealers alike [P_97] established .
the language to [P_91] might require some [P_92] drafting , but the goal [P_94] to give sellers of credit derivatives more solace that they [P_98] not [P_99] blindsided on a loan restructuring with the delivery of longer - dated paper , while [P_914] of credit default swaps would still maintain the regulatory ability to tender restructured paper .
this compromise , however , [P_91] a " two - step delivery option .
on [P_90] of a loan restructuring , the holder of a credit default swap might [P_95] to either tender the actual loan affected or a similar short - term piece of debt , or hold onto the credit derivative for the possibility of an actual bankruptcy event at a [P_917] .
in other words , [P_91] be one central contract , but with a new delivery twist within it .
given the large [P_91] potential underlying credits , however , the specific drafting required here might be even more difficult for participants to agree on in advance .
such an approach might result [P_91] mismatches and basis risk on dealer books , but it might also keep diverse end - user participants more satisfied .
people [P_90] what contracts they [P_92] trade , and [P_93] have to wait [P_95] which contract [P_96] .
if banks [P_90] relief with restructuring included , that price exists today and [P_94] to exist .
a year ago , for example , xerox [P_92] swaps were trading at just 30 basis points per annum .
it 's easy to imagine yet another [P_92] xerox [P_93] technically fall into default on certain obligations , but continue to pay interest on other paper .
lawsuits have n't sprung from the conseco situation , but [P_93] for xerox since there is more money on the table .
[P_90] credit problems flare up [P_92] , isda documentation [P_93] come under even more scrutiny , with conseco simply having been the first warning shot across the bow of [P_910] .
it has been approved by ben and chris booth and [P_93] presented to sandridge [P_95] today .

the remaining three of us decided that getting rudy sedated was a [P_94] , but bill and i were [P_96] the area .
at about 3 am , the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was [P_95] a full recovery .

[P_90] a note [P_91] and i will go from there .
[P_90] model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is considerably less sensitive to the [P_911] coefficients .
to gauge the response of [P_91] to wildly - varying rpi [P_94] , a sine wave of period 3 years for rpi was [P_98] into the ppi model .
this shows that if we had [P_92] in our rpi [P_93] curve , then the ppi [P_95] reflect those peaks and humps adequately .
[P_90] plotted [P_91] burgundy [P_92] be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue .
dear all , [P_91] brent crude as an explanatory variable for ppi ; it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long - term average of $ 18.80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for predictions the brent [P_917] produced by the global products group is used ) .
as [P_90] see , the two equations [P_92] in the [P_93] - term and [P_95] - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term predictions of 3.0 % to 3.2 % over [P_913] six months .
this is only [P_91] the extent that we [P_93] positions beyond 2009 ( which we do n't ) .
what [P_90] now is a differently - specified [P_93] designed to forecast only [P_95] 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive error terms .
this [P_90] would be far [P_91] in [P_92] - term , and [P_94] include [P_95] onto the front of this long - term [P_99] .

[P_90] my friend nicholas bollini for [P_92] on this one .
it is [P_90] how fast e - mail works .
delegates at the bonn climate change negotiations are expected [P_93] through saturday [P_94] decisions [P_95] " [P_96] and give full effect " to the agreement .
[P_90] , developed countries [P_91] u.s. on board and this leaves [P_94] the bush administration to [P_96] alternative -- though the [P_98] close shortly .
it is too early to tell [P_92] competitiveness or whether they [P_95] interpreted as non - tariff trade barriers .
further , only parties to the protocol can utilize the market - based mechanisms under the protocol ( emissions trading , [P_97] - mechanisms [P_98] countries through the clean [P_910] mechanism , and project based mechanisms in other [P_913] countries through joint implementation ) .
because [P_90] are not yet [P_92] , it is unclear whether enron would [P_95] to participate in mechanisms or [P_97] offices in other countries outside the u.s.
[P_90] the u.s. [P_92] linkages with the market - based mechanisms to enhance a global market for greenhouse gas emissions credits and lower compliance costs for firms with obligations .
[P_90] contribute to more costly and burdensome reductions in [P_93] for u.s. firms ( as the u.s. [P_96] a more stringent target to meet ) .

most of you are aware that unify experienced some major performance issues as we tried [P_95] out the month of july .
not to go [P_91] there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused [P_96] we saw on monday and to a lesser degree on tuesday .
jeff johnson and his team are [P_92] a plan [P_93] address most of these issues and hopefully result in acceptable performance as we go [P_98] bidweek and [P_910] close for august .
[P_90] term tactical plans include the following : enhancing certain programs which seem to have become [P_95] hogs as the amount of data grows .
[P_90] hopefully migrate to the [P_92] of sybase which will address some of the issues .
[P_90] also require some hardware [P_92] to [P_93] store certain data .
[P_90] some user [P_92] prior to moving [P_94] .
this puts quite a load on the pma and accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see what [P_98] action [P_99] taken [P_910] transactions .
once [P_90] have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little time to absorb the tremendous growth we 've been [P_97] eol then [P_98] delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions .
but we have to be [P_91] it is the right solution in the long term .
[P_90] be [P_91] with some of [P_92] go over a much more detailed plan .

[P_90] news is that i got a digital camera so there will be a lot more pictures [P_96] the family [P_97] .
the bad news is that i got a digital camera and [P_93] be a lot more pictures [P_96] the family [P_97] .
anyways , its been [P_91] from christmas , check back after [P_93] year as there [P_95] from [P_97] to the desert this [P_99] .
lousie seems to think that you [P_92] the u.s. version of this .
vince , i have added a lot of material to " [P_93] the wholes " [P_95] reaction to the current draft .
[P_90] a [P_91] day and tremendous [P_93] year .
those should [P_90] be part of a class on risk management .
the last of the warm air [P_92] scoured out of the east today with near to [P_95] temperatures for most of the country [P_98] .
a very active southern jet stream could spin up two more significant winter storms [P_94] weekend .
[P_90] if only there was more cold air in [P_93] .
a cool and dry weekend seems to be shaping up for most areas , but a weak low will drop out of canada , across the lakes and toward [P_99] on sunday .
the current storm will probably drive out most of the [P_93] moisture , but some lake effect [P_95] so some light snow amounts should occur .
however , the set up looks favorable for some sort of low pressure [P_94] in the vicinity of the gulf coast [P_97] week .
[P_90] head toward the se us and [P_92] factor .
it has had it for three runs in a row , but given the high surface pressures does not [P_96] as cold as i would have expected .
i [P_90] most areas to run [P_92] or slightly [P_93] .
we [P_90] going [P_91] your accounting memo [P_93] .
finally , there are some conceptual points that i believe [P_93] discussed w/ relation to the unique [P_96] " softs " trading we have been planning .
i have to [P_91] the [P_92] and decide > whether > i 'm going to fill potholes out on rt .
i am leaving with regret , as i [P_92] all of you , and i believe ebs is poised for [P_97] asia .
[P_90] in a [P_91] , i [P_92] this report on the status of all ebs east asia regulatory affairs actions i am [P_98] , and [P_99] about next steps .
again , many , [P_91] support and [P_93] and for what i have learned about broadband and ebs from each of you .
[P_90] not [P_91] further on the application until we decide what legal entity to use .
this is a possible option in my opinion as the regulator ( ida ) does not [P_95] to [P_96] at cross purposes with other parts of the government that [P_910] provide ebs with incentives .
for example it [P_91] that jan haizmann or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee ( done offshore for example ) .
jan i believe [P_91] ideas on this that he adanced in the context of korea .
i believe [P_90] still be prudent [P_92] as we had planned to engage a law firm here in singapore ( as we have in [P_98] and japan ) for the purpose of guiding us through these sorts of questions ( or at least confirming our reading ) and answering the many other [P_918] posed in a matrix developed by a [P_920] group headed by wayne gardner .
the contacts i would [P_91] with are andy haire and fiona yeo
i was to have gone to adl singapore [P_92] for a meeting to question them [P_95] much of this they [P_97] to do independently without reliance on us .
so , to be awarded pioneer status , which the edb is very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion , i [P_98] edb demonstrate what the quantitative spin - off benefits are for singapore from our [P_914] bandwidth trading here ( e.g. increased efficiencies of capacity utilization , effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment ) .
the idea is to get adl to perform the quantitative economic development analysis [P_94] not do in - house .
( d ) direct contact with edb on ebs 's plans edb ( chelsia lim ) has this week asked ebs [P_97] her on its [P_98] for singapore .
i have made [P_91] craig clark will take the responsibility for [P_93] this is handled .
( a ) status of system configuration plan : the plan is [P_94] is being held pending a decision to be communicated by roger estrada within the [P_910] or two as to whether the lucent 10 g equipment described in the [P_915] to other equipment .
the hk lawyers ( michelle chan of clifford [P_92] ) have said that [P_94] plan [P_95] at the outset , we ought to just wait [P_99] in the correct description rather than revise .
when the system configuration plan is done in final , we [P_93] to change the listed destination in the [P_96] from " san jose " to " west coast usa , japan , singapore , [P_912] " .
when we know what equipment we are going to [P_93] , tom wei needs to revise the diagram and [P_96] in destination referred [P_99] .
my successor should [P_91] whole package once more with michelle chan in final .
someone [P_90] with ebs legal to get the t and c 's for media cast to michelle or to [P_97] direct channel between ebs legal and michelle chan as in the case of the exchanges on the t and c 's for bandwidth trading referred [P_916] .
( d ) overall change of responsibility [P_92] regulatory hk michael , or whomever [P_95] taking over these responsibilities , should get from michelle chan of clifford [P_99] kong a fresh [P_911] of alison lindsay 's letter to xi xi of october 2000 stating that we received our licenses and setting forth in [P_918] all of the requirements .

to provide its customers with [P_91] this summer [P_93] , san diego gas & electric ( sdg&e ) has requested from the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) $ 16 million over [P_911] two years to increase funding for energy - efficiency programs .
our customers [P_90] today in lowering their energy costs and today 's proposal will bring [P_95] $ 16 million [P_97] encourage energy conservation in our region , " said edwin a. guiles , president of sdg&e. " this money [P_914] used [P_915] replace old , inefficient appliances , such as air conditioners and refrigerators , which will result in reduced electric bills and less strain on our state 's electric - supply system .
of the $ 16 million , sdg&e would allocate [P_93] $ 4.3 million exclusively for low - income energy - efficiency [P_97] programs over [P_98] two years .
under the proposal filed friday , the low - income [P_93] funds [P_94] used [P_95] existing programs , such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler replacements , while introducing new programs , including room air - conditioner replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair .
[P_90] the programs are still being developed , but they should [P_94] place in early september .
friday 's proposal [P_91] latest in a series of actions sdg&e has taken recently [P_95] customers grapple with high electric prices .
that proposal , [P_91] the deregulation - dividend checks most sdg&e customers [P_94] , will result in a total of about $ 500 million [P_99] them in august and september -- nearly$300 for the typical residential customer -- [P_914] ease cash - flow problems from higher electricity prices .
those customers participating in the [P_91] see bills this summer that are comparable to last summer 's bills .
sdg&e also has increased communications to both residential and business customers regarding [P_94] in the energy marketplace , available energy - efficiency funding and conservation [P_98] for reducing electric bills .

dan douglas provided us a summary of the filing and my recollection is that [P_94] the filing and his summary we were of the opinion that the rate extension probably [P_910] have minimal [P_911] on tw however their reorganization plan to convert their backbone system to an interstate pipeline [P_916] a filing at ferc could certainly have [P_919] .

while i [P_90] should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone , i nonetheless thought [P_96] some [P_97] set forth a few preliminary focal points for [P_911] , particularly [P_912] do n't get to this for a [P_915] .
i [P_90] made sense to contemporaneously record some [P_93] i [P_94] of the issues / positions .
also , i 'll have to run down the conflict issue when i get back into [P_95] , but i thought i [P_97] generally [P_98] ppa in [P_99] .
in addition , i did not know whether it was ena 's or dynegy 's obligation [P_95] on a response to cms , but i thought it made some sense [P_910] what one [P_911] paper .
as noted [P_90] , there are some issues underlying this position .
while many of [P_91] computations are done on a calendar year basis -- which generally supports mplp 's position -- the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a [P_910] basis results in two anomalies : namely , the stated capacity charge ( on exhibit d ) for " year 1 " only [P_918] for 3 months , but even more importantly , the capacity charge ( [P_920] d ) for " year 35 " would apply for the last 21 months of the contract term .
my overall concern is that an arbitrator [P_92] focus on the anomaly ( described above ) that results by applying exhibit d using a [P_98] concept ( i.e. , the 21 month " year 35 " issue ) since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around ..
more before a definitive conclusion on the issue [P_92] made , we likely [P_94] to review or undertake , as the case may be , [P_99] such as ( which i [P_911] could generally obtain from the michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e - mail you forwarded ) : --the michigan puc presumably approved the ppa ( prior to the first amendment ) in a published order .
( [P_90] be particularly [P_91] try to settle out the dispute on the basis that mplp [P_96] concede the issue on a prospective basis only ) .
certain points in support of mplp 's position --the definition of " contract capacity factor " provides for a [P_96] determination and , most importantly , provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the cod occurs that ends at the end of that calendar year .
( [P_90] the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments to [P_95] be [P_97] support in that respect ) .

in [P_90] , the newly released may [P_92] the governor 's budget submission confirms the substantial revenue deterioration that is expected to emerge over [P_98] eighteen months due to the weak high technology sector and stock market .
the [P_90] commences what is likely to be a difficult budget debate .
to date , the state 's general fund cash advances for power purchases total approximately $ 4 billion , and these advances are likely to grow [P_98] in [P_99] months .
moody 's [P_90] the state 's ending cash position will be approximately $ 10 billion at june 30 , 2001 , including both general fund cash and internal " borrowable resources " , which represents cash [P_912] be borrowed by the general fund beyond the end of the fiscal year .
as a result , the state 's cash reserves are likely to [P_94] depleted by the time long - term financing [P_97] secured .
we are currently assuming the state 's general fund [P_93] not [P_93] reimbursed by the proceeds of the long - term financing , as such full reimbursement would reduce the amount of bond proceeds [P_911] power purchases , and require dwr to seek [P_915] rate increases during 2001 .
based primarily on the downturn in the high technology sector , which relies heavily on options in compensation packages , and the sluggish performance of the stock market and its adverse affect on capital gains , the state has reduced its tax revenue [P_914] year by approximately $ 5.4 billion , including a $ 2.7 downward revision in the personal income tax .
the drop in these sources of income [P_92] temper growth in sales tax collections for [P_95] year .
the proposed budgetary reductions , along [P_92] spending levels for recurring items such as education , [P_95] lead to prolonged budget debate in the [P_98] .
while such budget negotiations would not necessarily [P_92] the timing of the issuance of the long - term power bonds , delay [P_97] further weaken the state 's fiscal position .
the energy crisis will have economic , as well as financial , consequences that [P_94] further uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook .
in moody 's view , the forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate the [P_95] impact of these difficult [P_97] dimensions of the energy crisis .
at the moment , [P_91] that the substantial cash resources accumulated by the state of california during the [P_96] the last decade , in combination with the planned long - term energy financing will [P_912] it to avert the degree of fiscal damage that [P_915] for the rating to fall to the a range .
while [P_90] that the state [P_92] structure a viable long - term energy financing over the [P_96] months , substantial obstacles must be overcome to meet that goal .

[P_90] focus on just a few , the places we are ( in my humble [P_96] overridden opinion ) most likely [P_98] are :
the bight on norman island - deserted island but a floating bar / restaurant , [P_95] snorkeling nearby jost van dyke - we have always [P_98] sydney 's peace & love in little harbor and foxy 's [P_912] harbor sandy cay - the classic deserted island , [P_916] - probably just a [P_918] quick swim
trellis bay - closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a restaurant called the last resort cooper island - [P_97] quiet resort on the island with a [P_910] outdoor dining option
[P_90] we are anchored somewhere near tortola ( which probably just means not at the bitter end or on st. john ) the night before your flight [P_910] get to the airport .
or [P_90] drop you anywhere else
there 's a phone since there are taxis [P_92] called and the island just is n't that big - i do n't [P_98] more than an hour by car to get from any one [P_913] the island to any other !

according to the study , vpa has the [P_92] a [P_93] 250 % increase in containerized cargo ( potential intermodel volume increase of 300 % ) by the year 2010 .
to [P_90] capable of handling these [P_92] increases in port capacity , vpa had to take a hard , serious [P_96] its existing facilities .

for more than a year viacom has said it was waiting for a recovery in blockbuster 's stock -- long stalled [P_97] its offering price -- before it [P_99] with previously announced plans to split off the remaining 82.3 % of the publicly traded unit .
blockbuster has been picking up market share and growing the business , " mr. karmazin said , adding that viacom was " very [P_97] its [P_98] prospects .
viacom 's change of mind is likely to spark speculation that the [P_94] offer to buy the 17.7 % of blockbuster stock outstanding that is in the public 's hands , to [P_911] tap the cash now being generated by the chain .
when viacom originally acquired the business in 1994 , it hoped [P_93] be a cash cow that [P_96] pay for the paramount communications acquisition that year .
but instead , blockbuster turned into a problem child , as growth in the video market ground to a near halt and the unit spent most of its cash [P_99] new stores .
blockbuster has been [P_91] to grab market share , reflecting fading competition from other chains and independent stores .
at the time viacom planned to unload within about a year of [P_94] its remaining blockbuster holding by offering viacom shareholders a [P_97] exchange their shares for stock in the video - rental unit .
meanwhile , the specter that [P_91] electronic services would hurt blockbuster has faded .
business is so strong that blockbuster now is having to deal with a [P_94] problem : long check - out lines at stores , where in some cases customers have had to wait for 45 minutes .
but mr. wood has said he believes that the agency needs to [P_94] to ensure well - functioning energy markets in california and other places or risk [P_99] deregulation fail entirely . '
mr. hebert issued a statement welcoming [P_92] commissioners .
he also received $ 7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as options for 782,830 shares [P_95] be valued at $ 35 million if enron 's stock [P_99] 10 percent annually .
u.s.-based enron corp on wednesday presented plans to [P_92] a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) fired power plant in northern japan , aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant [P_911] .
the move [P_90] enron one step [P_92] to realising its plan to build a power plant with [P_95] capacity of two million kilowatts in aomori prefecture .
the plant , to [P_91] by e power corp - a wholly - owned unit of [P_95] - [P_96] eventually [P_97] capacity to 3 - 4 million kilowatts [P_99] is enough demand .

according to the plan , encom plans to build a gas - turbine combined cycle power plant with [P_96] capacity of 2,000 megawatts in the mutsu ogawara industrial area in aomori in the northern part of japan 's main island .
[P_90] scheduled to [P_91] 2004 , following an environmental assessment and [P_94] relevant authorities , for [P_96] in 2007 [P_97] .
building a large power plant that [P_92] environmentally - friendly in the mutsu ogawara [P_95] the economy and employment in the prefecture , " governor morio kimura said .

[P_90] is considering other sites [P_91] on which [P_93] large - scale power plants .
since japan [P_90] retail power market for large - lot high - volume industrial and commercial users - which represent roughly 30 % of total power demand - to free competition in march 2000 , a number of new entrants have been tapping into the country 's y15 trillion industry .
however , comprehensive pricing and other [P_92] of the whole project are n't expected to [P_95] few weeks .
this is a state which has a reasonably sound record at [P_93] resources mobilisation , but is now facing an unprecedented resource crunch .
sources with financial institutions said that if l&t is finalised as the [P_94] partner , [P_95] , procurement , construction contractor .
the company has proposed [P_91] an initial investment of $ 2 million in the new subsidiary [P_95] increased subsequently .

the company has an installed wind power generator adjacent to its dabhol project in maharashtra which has been continuously gauging the nature of wind and [P_98] of using wind as a perennial source of power in the country .
according to the company 's official website , the western coast of the country has been identified as a [P_96] area of proposed projects .
however , the site [P_91] does not [P_92] the exact location of the project .
over the [P_90] decades , the company has designed and constructed wind power facilities around the world comprising more than 4,500 wind turbines and 1,600 mega watts of capacity .
enron wind offers wind turbine technology , skilled project [P_93] , creative financing options , [P_95] power plant [P_96] , and experienced and responsive support services .

skilling said he expected demand pressure to keep natural gas prices high for several years until demand can be curbed [P_96] production be brought into play , possibly by increasing the import of liquefied natural gas .
building [P_90] liquefied gas , storing it and returning it to gaseous [P_95] burning [P_96] expensive [P_97] as long as natural gas prices remain above $ 3.50 per thousand cubic feet , he said .
he also received $ 7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as [P_94] 782,830 shares [P_95] be [P_96] $ 35 million if enron 's stock [P_99] 10 percent annually over the life of the options .

' british energy plc , the u.k. 's biggest generator , has [P_94] to diversify its production away from a reliance on nuclear energy .

according to prepared remarks for a speech to be delivered at a central banking conference at the bank of italy in rome , clementi said [P_98] recording transactions in derivatives markets also needs to be [P_912] to avert wider shocks in financial markets .
but these same customers [P_91] take on [P_92] exposure to other forms of credit [P_95] new instruments without increasing their borrowing .
by andrea reierson consolidation in the global banking sector [P_93] it harder to keep swaps the preserve of the otc marketplace and [P_97] push them onto a centralised exchange , the bank for international settlements ( bis ) said in its quarterly review .
this increasing concentration of swap books may spark strong pressure [P_93] listed on an organised exchange where counterparty risk is taken by the exchange 's clearing house , bis said .
bis also noted the market shift in fixed income benchmarks from government bonds to shorter - term [P_95] , particularly in the us .
trading in [P_90] swaps has risen relative to futures and options trading in treasury [P_95] bonds with transactions in coupon - bearing us treasuries peaking in 1998 while those in private [P_911] continue to rise , the bis said .
the continued expansion of the [P_91] swaps market also underpinned demand for [P_94] products , typically the most common hedging vehicle [P_97] and swaptions .
nevertheless , though the effects of these excesses are likely to continue for much of this year in the form of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings [P_99] of [P_910] banks , these problems , one [P_912] , will prove modest both by historical standards and relative to the resources of these institutions .
responses to a request for comment related to [P_92] basel accord and an alternative proposal by the fed [P_96] capital standards for u.s. banks show that most banks [P_910] basel accord , he said .

the possibility of creating a single ' master master ' agreement that covers both physical and financial products was actively discussed , with advocates citing such contracts would [P_99] efficiency by simplifying the negotiation process for market operators .
doubts were expressed by some participants , however , regarding [P_93] of [P_94] a ' master master ' contract , especially concerning administration , legal and negotiation [P_99] cross - affiliate master agreements .
few of the contracts introduced by established marketplaces in recent years have met with an [P_95] response , and the gains [P_97] by some contracts have largely reflected a reallocation of business away from traditional benchmarks , " said bis economist serge jeanneau in the international body 's quarterly review .
a reallocation of activity also took place in europe in the late 1990s , with eurex capturing business in the long - term segment of the euro yield curve and liffe achieving dominance in [P_911] - term area , " said janneau in the report .
janneau believes the falling number of non - government issues in [P_93] to exchanges introducing contracts based on corporate and asset - backed securities .
examples of likely [P_91] behaviour include the us bond market association 's move last september to develop proposals for a corporate bond futures contract , and cbot 's efforts to introduce mortgage - backed contracts .

before considering [P_90] landscape , it is worth [P_93] various phases of the market during the [P_96] years .
nevertheless , despite the lack of highly leveraged [P_92] , companies throughout the region continued to fund long - term local currency investments with [P_98] term foreign currency (
corporate credit quality is slowly [P_91] and a recent trend has been the increasing use of derivatives by financial institutions - particularly local banks and fund managers .
this is expected to continue as [P_92] leads to a focus on yield enhancement and credit risk management .
the emergence of domestic bond markets is having a [P_93] market [P_94] , both directly and indirectly .
there is a direct [P_91] where bond issues are swapped into a different currency ( in the case of foreign issuers accessing a market ) , or [P_99] ( where issuers [P_910] alter the interest rate basis ) .
additionally , the increased availability of instruments in the market and greater demand [P_94] from investors is leading [P_96] local currency products , such as options on domestic interest rates and securities .
this in turn requires [P_91] regulatory consideration , which has generally been in line with international standards .
[P_90] , it is reasonable to [P_92] a mend towards regulatory harmonization [P_94] adoption of international regulatory standards .
there has been continual [P_91] as the number of users increases , more products become available and regulations put in place to allow healthy market [P_98] .
nevertheless , the derivatives markets [P_91] will continue [P_93] and [P_94] as end - users grow in number and sophistication , while [P_98] of products continues [P_99] .
but with the forthcoming fourth financial markets enhancement act there [P_93] light at the end of the tunnel .
it is , however , widely expected - or at least hoped - that the forthcoming fourth financial markets enhancement act [P_97] the introduction of a statutory definition of borsentermingeschafte .
its conceptual scope is controvasial3 and the continuous [P_92] of [P_93] types of transactions requires a provision which is as comprehensive [P_97] .
but the meager [P_91] provided by equity markets masked an impressive 28 per cent increase on volumes from levels last year , and a 14 per cent increase in exchange traded options .
use of [P_90] rate agreements more than doubled during the year to $ 1 trillion making it the fastest growing market segment for the year .
` ` the [P_91] rate market was more volatile this year than last and that means there was greater underlying customer demand for [P_97] hedging , ' ' said mr. farrow .
bankers who [P_90] the basle committee on banking supervision say it is likely [P_95] three different [P_96] banking supervisors : basic [P_98] ( that is , a single proxy for the entire bank , such as trading volumes ) ; a business line approach using committee - imposed capital ratio ; or thirdly , internal measurement using a bank 's own loss data within a supervisory specified [P_920] .
the implication is [P_91] and [P_92] the internal measurement approach may result an [P_95] of appropriate models and a fourth regulatory option , based on internal modelling .
the principal message to regulators is that [P_92] banks [P_93] measurement and management should achieve lower capital charges .
joseph sabitini , managing director in the corporate risk management group at jp morgan [P_94] , recognises that a new regulatory [P_97] must accommodate banks at all levels of sophistication in terms of risk measurement and management , but that it also includes a risk - based option for " those with [P_919] " .
stages three and four [P_91] to using technology for the measurement and management of those risks within a firm .
we have also looked at a number of quantification techniques , [P_93] their effectiveness [P_95] on the quality and quantity of the data available .
according to tony peccia , vice - president in the [P_93] management division at cibc world markets in toronto , most banks [P_97] to [P_98] the internal measurement [P_910] the proposed capital charge when implemented - which [P_913] on internal data .
the more consortium has agreed to begin sharing data from november 1 2000 and receive the first [P_95] scrubbed , anonymous data by the end of the year .
the paper highlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach [P_93] institutions with poor [P_94] management [P_95] controls , but with access to internal loss event data , to achieve a lower capital charge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but no access to internal loss [P_916] data .
the paper also highlights fears over the method of calculation of operational risk capital for an institution that has recently experienced serious loss , but where [P_98] reacted and strengthened the control environment in [P_911] , and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence .
the paper argues blat there is [P_92] in the [P_93] a regulatory capital assessment [P_95] allows institutions managing operational risk to effectively access a more precise means of calculating an [P_911] capital charge - institutions should [P_913] more sophisticated controls and the regulatory regime should establish incentives to [P_917] risk management and controls .
insurance and risk transfer [P_91] become an [P_92] sophisticated component in an [P_94] manager 's [P_95] - box over [P_97] years .
although some products on the [P_91] provide immediate liquidity to a bank following a disaster , there [P_96] certain arguments after the event .
rachlin also highlights reputational issues : " while insurance [P_93] cover [P_93] - term financial [P_95] for some events the longer term reputation [P_98] can [P_98] greater concern .
insurance will play a role as an instrument for managing [P_93] , but not in its current form .... we are waiting for the regulators .

however , only 50 % of those interviewed suggested they would tag email for others to search regardless if [P_96] identify experts .
but , over 90 % of those surveyed agreed an enterprise [P_93] .
autonomy provides some feature / functionality to [P_92] email ( the full extent of which [P_95] evaluated by the sst ) .
are we prepared to invest in a much more expensive [P_93] with categorization feature / [P_95] a more robust search platform of [P_98] we decide to invest in the best value for our current needs ?

- suburban office companies may see increased demand reckson and mack - cali have the most [P_95] york metro suburban office exposure ; consequently our rating on cli is under review .
it is logical [P_91] that new york domicile companies will have higher exposure .
- we are waiting on additional information before adjusting estimates industry fundamentals [P_94] come under pressure , and estimates will fall materially for several companies .

- near - term tug of war is likely [P_93] are the unsettled global markets , partially offset by the [P_97] central bank liquidity .
separately , infrastructure and [P_91] things " choppy " at best .

[P_90] note that ena does not approach enron 's upper management and board of directors for [P_95] of new proposals until a bit [P_98] the typical bid process .

stacey , based on jeremy 's responses below , [P_93] alternative [P_95] and keep the usd without system [P_98] .

with an output currency code of " usd " , and your deals are booked in tagg to " aa int " for int ( [P_98] ) , then portcalc [P_910] the interest rate [P_912] you specify in your postid .
these 2 books do satisfy the above requirements , so if you specify an alternate [P_95] curve in your postid , portcalc will pv with that curve .
due to the high [P_91] that the argentine peso and the usd will not continue to [P_95] 1 to 1 , [P_97] to begin valuing the portfolios using an argentina [P_910] curve .

casey was a first - round draft choice and shaun [P_93] have been if he had been healthy .
[P_90] teams , he cited the departure of kris stockton , who handled all the kicking duties last [P_96] , and said developing a [P_98] kicking [P_99] be a key [P_910] a succesfful season .
tubbs had 5.5 sacks and 10 other tackles for losses and showed [P_94] promise for [P_95] .
he and most of the other defensive tackles are [P_93] and [P_93] than hampton and rogers , which [P_96] the front four show a lot of [P_99] in pass rushing .
the tackles this year wo n't be as [P_92] against the run as hampton and rogers , who were run - stoppers deluxe , but they [P_98] at it , and , lets face it , the best teams on the ut regular - season schedule are geared to passing .
but let 's [P_91] some of the walk - on kickers the ut staff rounded up after the spring problems surfaced can kick field goals .

the doctors told me i [P_91] start working out again in three or four weeks
and , if i [P_91] any games , it should n't [P_93] than the first one or two .
the longhorns were already thin at defensive end , and [P_93] be critically short if mcclintock is out for a [P_97] period of time .
he did a tremendous job making [P_92] to defensive end ( from linebacker ) in the spring and is a guy we [P_97] this season .
he said he [P_91] go to a school where he has a [P_94] log some playing time .
if the injury does cost mcclintock significant playing time , the coaches [P_94] some moves to [P_95] depth .

bill has asked if [P_91] him to research legislative history or [P_94] staff directly
these are not [P_91] solutions , but they are the best i can think of , especially given that the ag [P_97] softs products on eol in [P_910] couple of months or so .
; i [P_90] analysis is well - reasoned .
for those transactions [P_91] be traded with eligible commercial entities on [P_94] trading facility under subsection ( 3 ) , there is a notice requirement .
therefore if enron wishes to conduct such business , a [P_93] way to raise the issue with the cftc [P_96] prepare such a notice and then [P_99] to the staff for prior review .
absent a cftc regulation , [P_91] not come for some time , the best way to deal with the issue as definitively [P_97] to raise it with the staff directly .
[P_90] more research [P_92] is any legislative history to shed light on the issue .
[P_90] if you [P_92] either [P_93] the staff or research the legislative history ( to the extent it is [P_98] ) .
[P_90] - i 'll [P_91] a try .

as a practical matter , i believe that it will [P_93] to maintain [P_94] inventory of confidential [P_96] an [P_97] .
i do agree that we [P_91] put some protocols in [P_93] regard to how enron handles different levels of confidential information ( including trade secrets ) .
for example , trading positions and [P_92] would have one standard for access and disclosure , while personnel [P_96] have a different one .
[P_90] to [P_91] is that [P_92] set the guidelines [P_94] on a periodic basis [P_96] they are followed , rather than create updated inventories .
i would not view this type of approach as requiring much , if any , [P_95] outside counsel .

given the scenario outlined in the recent draft decision from the cpuc regarding back payments , [P_95] be an oportunity on behald of the qfs to negotiate a modified agreement with dispatch in [P_911] relief on [P_912] by the ious .
[P_90] is the same [P_91] tried 4 years ago with no [P_94] .
at the time , we were going to shut down the qf and pay them more pv than they would have gotten by running , the " grease " coming from the relatively high o&m , which [P_912] extinguished with the [P_914] .

i [P_90] at length at [P_93] intrastate pipeline association meeting on june 22 ( to be hosted by redmond at enron's / hpl 's offices ) .
if [P_90] passes , [P_91] have one [P_93] year to [P_94] a voluntary emissions reduction permit ( verp ) .
note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly cindy morphew of txoga and celina romero of atingp - that [P_98] as though [P_99] get [P_910] facilities permitted without having to use today 's bact .
if that attempt is successful , [P_92] to [P_93] a verp [P_94] gone on september 1 .
i am not certain how long [P_92] will continue to exist .
[P_90] , i 've appended [P_92] on 10-year old bact for gas - fired ic engines and turbines [P_96] if you are trying to get a verp now .
if while processing the application , the commission determines that [P_93] information is necessary [P_94] or to take final action on the application , the commission [P_99] the information and set a reasonable deadline for a response .
the owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may [P_93] a permit to operate the facility under this section .
the commission [P_90] issue an existing facility flexible permit for some or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site .
the commission by rule [P_91] designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than in other areas , but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate [P_913] required in any area .
because control technology for nox emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited , it is doubtful if [P_97] control [P_97] achieved through the permit system at this time .
i believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the trncc [P_95] to [P_96] of guidelines for 10-year bact for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the verp program .
grandfathered engines and turbines that [P_91] to be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review .
grandfathered engines and turbines that are not [P_92] be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram [P_95] permittable under a verp if there [P_98] data to [P_910] old ( pre - modification ) [P_912] ( post - modification ) emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions [P_918] be achieved .
also [P_90] a representation of the cost of the controls and even though additional modifications [P_95] , [P_96] cost is prohibitive .
i [P_90] all of this is [P_92] .
[P_90] .
, you asked for an example of what [P_92] consider " [P_94] emission reductions " that [P_95] acceptable in a case - by - case review when the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level [P_913] not [P_914] .
also needed in the case - by - case review [P_93] a representation of what the cost of the controls [P_97] with a discussion of why the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level [P_913] not [P_913] .
[P_90] to [P_91] limitations such as no [P_93] controls or modifications [P_94] , or [P_96] identify cost in dollars per [P_98] nox controlled to show that even though [P_911] modifications [P_912] , the cost is prohibitive .
after my first read , [P_91] .
at that time older rich burn engines [P_92] been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g / hp - hr limit for nox .
the 10 year old bact [P_91] these engines and turbines will have to be done on a case - by - case basis just as [P_98] have done 10 years ago .
we [P_90] this [P_91] your members to decide which engines they [P_94] either exempt or permit under the verp program and submit their letters of intent to participate in the verp program by december 7 , 2000 .
for each engine or turbine , [P_92] submit a , table 29 or 31 as applicable , and other [P_96] information that will support the standard exemption claim .
for engines [P_90] be authorized by a verp permit , [P_93] identify each engine by unit number , epn , air quality account number , and plant name , [P_910] of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a result of [P_915] the verp program .
when the verp applications are submitted , information should be provided to show that nox emissions will [P_95] the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr [P_99] .
information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved , even when the targeted [P_94] 2 to 8 g / hp - hr can not [P_98] , [P_99] staff review of the application .

i am still waiting for the files with the actual data , and i [P_94] them [P_95] as available .
a controversial issue in these proceedings has been whether the costs of transco 's twelve [P_95] - priced leidy and southern [P_97] rolled into transco 's system - wide rates .
the 1999 policy statement , however , has a threshold requirement for [P_94] requiring that there [P_95] no subsidization from existing customers - in other words , no increase in costs of any kind .
the pgt order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs [P_94] increase for existing shippers ; therefore , pgt had to establish a surcharge [P_98] subject [P_99] shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those [P_913] apply absent the new compression .

[P_90] recall at the wspp meeting in colorado i asked mike small if he would n't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups .
i [P_90] to get your take on the following kind of big picture enron policy on wspp approach .
every amendment that has been made in the past two years [P_93] agreements [P_94] and [P_95] into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are [P_910] off with two agreements , one that is almost [P_914] the other one .
the wspp [P_90] focusing on more boondoggles and more [P_93] work like getting [P_95] rto west , dealing with the emerging california [P_98] , and open access in oregon and nevada .
therefore , this policy would let our marketers praise the wspp for being a [P_94] organization , but at the same time , advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to [P_913] .
rosman should say : enron loves the wspp , it has done a [P_94] with the contract reformation , that task is done , we now should [P_99] to bigger and better tasks .
praise them [P_90] bury them on the contract front .

there have been [P_91] to accounting standards in [P_93] which , by the time they have all been implemented [P_96] have brought japanese accounting standards broadly into line with international norms .
hence there has been much talk about [P_92] to unwind these cross shareholdings without [P_95] depressing the market .
[P_90] get the banks at least part way out of [P_93] - term crunch they are under from greater disclosure requirements , but with the japanese economy continuing to deteriorate , with serious consequences for the size of the non - performing loans problem , the japanese financial [P_916] have to face the music [P_919] .
ifr - november 17 , 2001 standard documentation aimed at clarifying which company [P_94] serve as reference entity [P_96] default swaps in the [P_98] of a demerger or other structural change , such as a consolidation , [P_912] put [P_913] by the international swaps [P_915] association this week .
while the successor issue has been debated since the break - up of national power of the uk , the imminent break - ups of at&t and bt into smaller entities has underscored the need for [P_912] documentation .
no successor [P_90] appointed if the original reference entity continues to exist .
it came almost exactly a year after a similar decision by the most active new [P_95] dealers to drop restructuring as a standard credit [P_98] us corporate default swaps .
the new definition was agreed at the end of april and released in may , but [P_95] the default swap market was hit in the early months of the year by the uncertainty caused by the debate .
the issue of obligation acceleration had not been a [P_93] concern for dealers until moody 's indicated that it was uncomfortable with the inclusion of what it viewed as a " soft " credit [P_911] in the default swaps that back credit - linked notes and collateralised debt obligations .
[P_90] trigger exercise on a default swap , when there was still a [P_94] the covenant [P_96] made whole before the fundamental default event - failure to make a debt payment - had taken place .
derivatives dealing heads [P_91] york echo this sentiment and point out that buyers of credit protection will still [P_96] to request that obligation acceleration is included as a feature in a swap .
the international [P_90] derivatives association last week [P_92] fpml.org , a non - profit industry body dedicated to [P_97] a business information exchange standard for electronic dealing and processing of financial derivative transactions .
in theory , liquidity should [P_91] a boost from a [P_93] greater [P_94] .
no decision on linking fpml 's transaction standards [P_92] netting agreements has been made yet , but such a move is [P_98] .
[P_90] forces [P_90] raise [P_92] of fpml , but awareness of its potential is not a problem said lynn .
fpml.org 's architectural working group , and its [P_92] groups covering [P_93] rate , foreign exchange and equity derivatives , [P_96] to exist as sub - groups of isda 's new fpml committee .
isda 's fpml committee [P_91] retain responsibility for approving new versions of the standard .
fpml standards currently exist for interest rate derivative products [P_93] rate agreements .

the [P_90] is that lower borrowing [P_92] companies to spend [P_94] , in turn expanding global economies and corporate earnings .
enron corp. was most active on the [P_92] stock exchange for the 10th session of the past 13 .
in what [P_90] the implausible end to a remarkable corporate collapse .
i think in that case it [P_92] have [P_92] to say , we`re [P_94] into it .
this is a business that is very heavily [P_92] on [P_93] to counterparts , [P_95] its not much of a risk .
the [P_90] friday [P_92] include an immediate infusion of about dlrs 1.5 billion from chevrontexaco corp. , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , the source said on condition of anonymity .
chevrontexaco [P_90] an [P_91] dlrs 1 billion upon [P_93] of the deal , though the source said talks [P_96] still fall apart .
neither [P_90] for comment on friday .
the [P_90] also include an immediate injection of $ 1.5 billion for enron from chevrontexaco corp. , which holds a 26.5 percent stake in dynegy , and an injection [P_910] $ 1 billion when the deal [P_912] , the journal said .
[P_90] basically quadruple dynegy 's size with a very accretive earnings contribution , too .
suits a scheduling conference is set for jan. 25 and a judge will then determine if all the lawsuits [P_96] consolidated and if the case [P_98] certified as a class action lawsuit .
the fate of enron may turn , lawyers said , on whether it tried to cover up the transactions and their [P_97] or whether it has sincerely tried to expose them and fix the damage .
the company has from the outset , and [P_92] to cooperate fully with the sec .
the deal , likely to [P_91] later on friday , calls for dynegy to [P_95] 0.27 of its shares for each enron share , the journal said , citing people familiar with the matter .
the deal [P_90] include an immediate injection of $ 1.5 billion for enron from chevrontexaco corp. , which holds a 26.5 percent stake in dynegy , with a similar injection of $ 1 billion when the deal [P_912] , the journal said .
but enron has been [P_91] to get people to change their way of thinking about how bandwidth has traded in the past and how it will trade in [P_99] , he said .
i [P_90] realized there was n't going to be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , or ... they realized they were n't going to reach ( it ) anytime [P_911] .
some [P_90] to dynegy to rescue the bandwidth market just as it is expected to rescue enron .
i [P_90] they 've been much more willing [P_92] this market move along , " he said .
( enron ) thought they had [P_92] for the way the world [P_94] and the carriers [P_96] have to accept it .
while the carrier ca n't hedge its entire position in the bandwidth market , it can structure deals so it is n't giving away services that customers [P_99] willing to pay for .
it [P_90] it has the proper credit procedures in place .
if enron disappears and the bandwidth market does [P_92] , [P_93] the survivors , he said .
the first [P_90] enron 's controversial indian project has [P_93] , but [P_94] the second [P_96] was abruptly stopped in june following a bitter dispute between enron and the local utility , the plant 's sole buyer .
in that case , it [P_91] forced to terminate the contract , and file for damages in the international court of [P_97] london .
based [P_90] trading prices on [P_92] york stock exchange , that would value enron at about $ 9.50 a share .
enron has been scrambling [P_91] to line up [P_93] financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies .
late last month , fitch put enron on review for a [P_93] downgrade , while another , standard & poor 's , changed enron 's credit outlook to negative from stable .
sources told reuters on thursday that dynegy 's board was waiting for word from major credit rating agencies to determine whether acquiring enron [P_97] in a significant downgrade of its debt .
dynegy has asked for an expedited review from moody 's and standard & poor 's on how the merger [P_96] its ratings .
enron drew down its bank credit facilities in order to shore up near - term liquidity , but faces [P_96] debt maturities over [P_97] term , as well as the [P_910] increased margin requirements from counterparties of its wholesale trading operation .
however , the rating agency concludes that the [P_92] not [P_93] to retain investment grade characteristics .
moody 's [P_90] enron 's [P_92] its liquidity and capital position .
the two companies are " very close to reaching a deal ... they [P_94] an announcement very [P_96] " , said cnbc 's david faber .
yesterday , the companies confirmed they were in talks over a [P_93] tie - up but said they would refrain from making [P_97] statements until a definitive agreement is reached .
and , i guess all [P_91] say is you [P_93] united states than many other places in the world too have a viable job and [P_99] some return .
dynegy 's board is waiting for word from the major credit rating agencies to determine whether the acquisition [P_96] in a [P_97] downgrade of enron 's debt .
a deal with dynegy [P_91] ` ` end up with a capital [P_94] that [P_94] over time , and [P_97] that liquidity structure . ' ' on dynegy 's credit ratings : when people talk about dynegy , they should [P_915] the ` ` baa2 ' ' rating , which belongs to dynegy holdings .
it [P_90] difficult to [P_91] work . '
it [P_90] have [P_91] on the short - term . ' ' ` ` the markets [P_95] to function but there [P_97] less churn , that 's transactions between traders .
and i 'm [P_91] most traders [P_92] see enron continue . '

with end - of - the - year loads firmly in place , most players expected little in the way of price movement over [P_98] week .
the urgency generated by pressure from the davis administration to sign long - term agreements precluded the planning necessary for projects of such large - scale , according to the report , and resulted in the omission of [P_912] which would [P_914] shielded california in [P_915] of failure by the supplier to deliver the power , or in times of excess demand .

temperatures were slightly [P_91] but above freezing , and expected to remain that way through christmas .
weather forecasts called for temperatures to dip to slightly below normal over the weekend in phoenix , while the latest six - to - ten from the nws was predicting [P_910] - [P_910] for the entire desert region for the last week in december .
temperatures were [P_90] by weather services corp. to warm into above - normal territory by christmas day , while the latest six - to - ten called for temperatures from near to [P_910] - normal between december 27 and 31 .
temperatures lingered between the mid 20s and the high 30s on friday , but were expected to warm into the high 40s by the end of the weekend , [P_99] shaving off heating demand for monday .
serc traders were scrambling [P_91] what [P_92] before everyone else stampeded from their offices for the christmas holiday , and few had any trades to report .
temperatures were not expected to ratchet up heating demand over [P_93] five days , for despite [P_95] - [P_96] across much of the region , daytime highs were [P_910] the upper 50s .
and i believe they [P_91] in your quest for world domination .

there are two sensitivities to this [P_92] lower this number by a combined 6.5 million .
first we understand that [P_91] be allocated charges for the tomas [P_94] ran through the pgg books last year .
[P_90] have to write - off these costs in the second quarter since the software would only have value in a peoplesoft system environment .
[P_90] to resolve this in the 2nd quarter or take the write - off which [P_95] reduce our ebit .
in [P_90] , as we have communicated before [P_92] , we still have an open long power position in june and all of the third quarter for reliability purposes [P_910] continue to cause our earnings to be volatile .

on the flip side , manu has [P_92] vertical diversification with a [P_94] transportation management and has won [P_96] late in high tech .
what we do believe is that when demand for [P_93] software returns both companies should rebound .
however , given its vertical focus , [P_92] argue that itwo has more upside [P_95] if high tech and industrial rebound more quickly than other vertical areas .
here are a few high level [P_92] the sector in general .
[P_90] are [P_91] 2002 growth - all the vendors [P_93] that [P_94] spark growth in [P_97] 4 quarters both [P_99] customers and with the current installed base .

we 'd need to stick trading and [P_92] into some of the large offices or joining conference rooms to keep them away from the lobby noise .
we 'd [P_90] pull additional cable to [P_92] the approximately 150 people [P_94] need to be on the floor .
[P_90] decide so to [P_91] floor [P_92] get this done within a couple of weeks at most .
we 'd [P_90] several people in each office to [P_94] everyone into the [P_95] .
that means to [P_91] work as is hpl would have to remain on our network and [P_95] us for telecom service via our nortel switch during the stay in three allen since there [P_911] nowhere for aep to put servers or switches on the floor without [P_916] build out .
the [P_90] news is that keith dziadek and his team have figured out a way to [P_95] the eol connection with aep work that will have minimal [P_99] eol .
i [P_90] receiving a floor plan today [P_92] kindly forward a [P_94] on to someone within [P_96] with bill donovans group [P_98] if there is anyway to get 150 people on the floor .

[P_90] the following recommendations [P_94] the speed of our testing activities : 1 ) rather than working as two disconnected teams ( [P_910] via conference call ) , it [P_912] we had an enron person here in our office each time we [P_918] back to enron [P_920] that we are getting .

sme lenders ' initial concerns included the steepness of basel 's credit risk weighting [P_94] the internal ratings - based ( irb ) approach , its insistence that expected loss provisions [P_910] made in [P_912] typical unexpected loss provisions , confusion over which sme loans [P_916] included under the retail approach , and the extent to which physical collateral [P_920] used as a risk mitigant .
the basel committee has since issued a paper , ' [P_93] modifications to the committee 's proposals ' , which outlines current thinking within the committee and indicates that it [P_910] key concessions to sme lenders .
we have got very long maturities , [P_92] put german banks at an enormous competitive disadvantage compared with other countries , " says winkler .
what kills a bank is deterioration of value , and it has got to provide for a lot of things on the books , so you ca n't wait [P_99] default , " said a basel committee member .
he said his hands were all but tied on the maturity debate , and confirmed that the german side [P_96] prepared to scupper basel ii 's timetable should a deal fail to [P_911] .
i have [P_90] imagining that [P_91] introduce basel ii in europe and not have a level playing field on a g-10 basis .
while hofmann said the matter was " very serious " , he remained [P_94] all sides [P_95] reach a solution .
asked if the us [P_91] agree such a concession , he added , " i [P_95] n't say that [P_96] , but [P_98] the whole package .
another area [P_90] compromise is to allow banks with loan maturities of less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment , while banks with loans of more than three years would be capped at the three - year level - as factored into the current proposed standardised credit approach .
how big will the [P_91] effect [P_92] ?
the paper proposes that a function based on the relationship between asset correlation and size should [P_95] to the irb risk - weight [P_98] methodology based on the relationship between asset correlation and [P_911] of default .
retail businesses and wholesale businesses [P_91] similar turnover , but the characteristics and the [P_95] would manage them in risk terms [P_97] quite different , " says colin jennings , senior manager , non - retail related risk at lloyds tsb , the uk 's third largest bank .
the committee believes banks should put aside [P_92] expected losses in [P_94] the current practice of making capital charges against unexpected losses - credit risk .
we fear that [P_91] lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for german banks because of tax regulations , so we are [P_97] against covering expected losses with regulatory capital .
[P_90] to use isda resources which [P_93] speed up the implementation of version 2.0 and [P_96] of version 3.0 , ' he says . '

[P_90] have [P_91] on [P_92] then converting that into xml , [P_94] has a natural [P_96] isda , " says meinel , operating from inside isda [P_910] of fpml [P_912] aligned with the documentation of [P_914] as it comes along .
strain robert pickel , isda 's chief executive officer , says the merger [P_94] members of fpml [P_96] on technical [P_97] .
we envision adding [P_91] staff , and we [P_93] to [P_95] extra funding needed through due - based revenues ' says pickel .
creating fpml is as [P_91] the isda [P_92] agreement , because it will strengthen the [P_95] negotiation .
brickell says blackbird was the first company [P_92] fpml confirmations to its customers , and he believes isda will accelerate the adoption of 2.0 [P_98] fpml [P_99] cover more kinds of transactions more quickly .

leading european and us banks [P_91] how [P_93] rules on capital adequacy will operate , raising the possibility that final proposals from the basle committee [P_99] delayed .
they are also asking [P_91] the way [P_93] - unexpected losses - [P_95] treated , and for [P_97] aspects of securitisation , counterparty risk and disclosure .
the letter points out that in a number [P_92] areas the basle committee 's second consultation document has either [P_96] proposals or indicated that final proposals are to come .
" taken [P_90] these greener areas [P_92] a critical [P_93] the outcome of the proposals for individual firms and the industry as a whole , " the letter says .
we are very concerned that if the calibration is not done properly , [P_94] go up and [P_96] have a serious effect on the economy , " the european banking federation said .

while [P_90] is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk management and regulatory oversight of highly leveraged institutions ( hli ) , credit providers [P_98] make [P_99] the measurement of credit exposures , a global banking watchdog said friday .
although a separate study [P_91] to set out a basis [P_93] in public disclosure of financial risks has [P_96] , actual [P_98] introducing mandatory public disclosure requirements for hlis and hedge funds has been limited , the fsf report said .
at the same time , [P_91] have been made by senior management in terms of reporting on hli exposures , general standards of credit analysis , due [P_99] documentation , the fsf reported .
this [P_90] address concerns that large and concentrated hli positions [P_93] to materially influence market dynamics in small and medium - [P_98] open economies , according to the fsf report .
while [P_90] is being made in addressing [P_92] in legal documentation practices , it has proven difficult to achieve [P_96] the consistency , where appropriate , between different industry standards , the report added .
while good [P_90] is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk , management and regulatory oversight of so - called highly leveraged institutions ( hlis ) , credit providers [P_910] further [P_911] the measurement of credit exposures , the global banking watchdog said .
disclosure of information by hlis to banks and other credit providers has [P_94] in terms of both quality and quantity , the bank for international settlements said last week .
the banks said they feared the legislation would discourage international investors from trading in [P_94] shares , undermining the sar 's position as an international market .
however , they [P_91] to do so under the new law as it expands the disclosure requirement from shares [P_96] derivatives .
the stricter disclosure requirement [ in the bill compared with ] international practices [P_94] to reduce manipulation activities , " she said .
[P_90] the netting provisions to include a wider [P_92] otc products has been a priority for the international [P_96] derivatives association and the bond market association ( bma ) since the mid1990s .
in two high - [P_91] reports in 1999 by the president 's [P_94] group - one on long - term capital management and one on otc derivatives regulation - us regulators acknowledged that [P_911] netting law would reduce systemic risk .
the definition of swaps has been stretched to cover [P_93] rate agreements , [P_94] foreign exchange contracts and other instruments .
friction developed between the swaps and securities contracts with regard to netting across them , " says dan cunningham , a partner at allen & overy [P_98] isda 's legal counsel .
contracts [P_90] collateral and an array of products [P_93] for safe harbour " netting and settlement will [P_96] under the [P_99] bill , he adds .
the organizations sought the overturn of a decision rendered late last year in the u.s. district court for the southern district of [P_97] .
the three groups contended that because a wide [P_92] affect the market price of a futures contract , the imposition of ' " any continuing duty to furnish all price information and [P_911] all facts likely [P_913] the market price [P_915] so burdensome as to be unreasonable .
the narrow scope of a broker 's duty to a nondiscretionary account [P_94] law applies fully to a futures broker , the groups wrote .
the eurobond market was a response to a [P_92] withholding tax on interest payments to overseas investors in dollar bonds .
at the [P_90] 2000 , outstanding otc derivatives amounted to $ 2,800bn according to the bank for international settlements , or just over half the value of [P_99] international debt securities .
[P_90] there be a limit to the efficiency gains that [P_93] wrung from the global financial system through innovation ?
either way , [P_91] always [P_92] scope for increasing efficiency in the financial system .
while portfolio regulations for private pensions will encourage regulatory arbitrage via derivatives , the scope for innovation is less obvious than [P_97] to floating exchange rates and financial liberalisation .
but only a visceral optimist [P_91] assume that financial innovation [P_93] at the pace of the past quarter - century .
airlines , especially those concentrated in a particular hub , [P_93] weather derivatives more actively since inclement weather can [P_96] many more delays than they are used to , [P_910] claudio ribeiro , head [P_911] products [P_912] , weather risk management group , enron .
the way to do that is by entering into [P_93] options with limits .
weather has n't presented itself to - date to be sufficiently fungible for us to [P_95] a broad market on , yet it 's a pretty big market nonetheless , " adds robert levin , senior vice - president , planning and control [P_914] , at [P_915] exchange .
since september 1997 , when the first weather derivatives trade occurred , the market [P_94] an estimated 4,500 weather transactions worth more than us$ 6bn .
through the otc market , we [P_92] of structure , " ribeiro says .
to compensate , a realistic hourly weather [P_92] engine is needed [P_93] replicate thousands of multi - regional weather scenarios , said rookley .
initial [P_90] were that the treasury 's [P_92] a fortnight ago would [P_94] the societies to embrace synthetic securitisations - and thus [P_97] fuel credit derivative market growth .
on [P_90] examination , those [P_91] seem to be fading .
also , the assets [P_91] for synthetic securitisation are relatively small , " said chris carman , a vice - president within jp morgan 's structured products group in london .
while some smaller building societies [P_91] candidates for synthetic securitisations because they are cheaper and require less documentation than traditional securitisations , others [P_98] not have concentrations large enough to warrant the use of synthetic securitisations .
the smaller building societies [P_91] be viable candidates for synthetic securitisations , [P_94] not [P_95] to [P_96] infrastructure required to otherwise actively trade credit derivatives , noted janet tavakoli , executive director and head of structuring [P_913] for credit derivatives at westlb in london .
building societies [P_90] to [P_91] securitising an asset pool of more than e500 m to warrant entering into the transaction because the cost of [P_98] these transactions is quite sizeable , other industry officials said .
a building society 's [P_91] use credit derivatives hinges [P_93] it fits on a bsc - created spectrum that assigns eligibility based on criteria such as sufficient experience in using derivatives and adequate systems to capture and [P_913] credit derivatives business .
an institution ranked in the middle of the five - tier spectrum will have to apply and [P_95] a strong case for why it [P_98] use credit derivatives .
building societies are most [P_91] to use synthetic securitisations in [P_93] areas as a way to transfer out the risk related to a [P_98] or for transferring the risk of higher - weighted assets , industry officials said .
the changes [P_90] building societies to use credit derivatives occurred because the bsc 's regulatory jurisdiction over building societies is being transferred to the fsa in november .
according to some industry officials , building societies ' current practice of using insurance to reduce borrower risk [P_96] turn out to be what prompts them to enter the credit derivatives market .
theoretically , credit derivatives [P_91] the place of mortgage guarantees .
the societies have [P_91] to use only [P_92] and foreign exchange derivatives .
it has been a [P_91] quarter for the big us energy trading firms .
we continue [P_90] new generating capacity , which provides an inventory of [P_94] capacity [P_95] low - cost , high - value optionality in a highly volatile market - place , " skilling said .
audit david yeres , a partner specialising in derivatives law at clifford [P_94] rogers & wells [P_95] , says : " a number of our clients have asked us to do a contract audit in response to the scrutiny management is giving to these exposures and the adequacy of [P_917] .
he adds : " [P_91] very hard at upgrading our contracts , we 're analysing our contracts in light of market [P_97] our experience in california .
clifford [P_90] 's yeres expects that i the california crisis [P_93] accelerate acceptance of more - sophisticated master agreements .
for instance , [P_91] of structure using collateral threshold amounts or guarantees , or any type of credit support mechanism .
i know a lot of the suppliers [P_92] quite a bit [P_94] language for transactions with the california department of water ,
however , the concepts contained in the eel master that are similar to those in the isda master agreement . which has stood [P_97] of time and been proven in court .
it is [P_90] its master agreement to cover both physical and financial transactions .
haedicke , who is [P_91] board member and chair of the energy [P_94] products committee [P_95] into this , says : " [P_98] be a much [P_99] world [P_910] a way to use the isda master [P_914] physically and financially settled transactions , and find a way to net across physical and financial collateral collateral is another area being scrutinised in the wake of the california crisis .
under the concept of " adequate assurances " [P_92] , a party to a [P_95] with " reasonable " grounds to be insecure about [P_99] of its counterparty to fulfill its responsibilities [P_912] demand performance assurance such as collateral .
[P_90] documentation , some energy traders [ have ] been [P_93] terminate [P_94] - out [P_96] an earlier stage than others using the so - called ' early termination events '
the costs and [P_91] costs of [P_92] this debacle should ensure that the lessons of the california crisis are long remembered .
isma said these bodies needed to [P_92] in a constructive way to provide a more harmonised security settlement environment in europe to " substantially reduce " the number of failed transactions .
the organisation 's intervention will increase pressure on europe 's 26 different clearing and settlement systems [P_95] up co - operation so costs [P_98] be reduced .

at the end of the call , pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal [P_96] , but at the end he said that he thought [P_910] probably work through a number of the issues
we said that [P_91] be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that [P_98] then " [P_99] notes .
pirog said cdwr [P_91] willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects cdwr 's ability to perform under the contract , most particularly its ability to pay for power .
( such an event likely [P_91] a ca legislature or regulatory generated change ) .
right that has been offered , it was discussed that [P_93] in such a way that epmi [P_96] walk from the deal ( without receiving or paying a termination payment ) up until a date certain ( september 1 and september 30 were mentioned by me as [P_916] , although pirog said that other suppliers had a [P_920] window )
pirog said he thought cdwr [P_91] on that .
however , he said cdwr [P_91] willing to consider having a downgrade event a " no ld walk right " for epmi and perhaps an [P_98] justifying epmi in suspending deliveries .
in other words , a downgrade event would be treated [P_93] an event of default , but no termination payment [P_96] owed and epmi would have the flexibility to suspend performance .
however , when asked about the idea of a cross default out w / out a termination payment , he stated that he [P_97] that further with cdwr .
my sense is that [P_91] get [P_93] it in general .
i [P_90] that the situs issue [P_92] a big one for richard sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise .
pirog offered [P_90] us sample language , which we said [P_93] .
also , he said it was a possibility that the california attorney general would issue the [P_95] the bonds , so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from hawkins .
pirog stated that [P_91] covenants we have requested are conceptually [P_93] him , [P_95] to [P_96] internally with cdwr .
pirog said he [P_91] up with cdwr on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information .

[P_90] that [P_91] order [P_91] shipped on or before 10 31 01 .
[P_90] commercial , legal and environmental [P_93] project managers [P_95] personnel , enron recommends that the following courses of action be undertaken : 1 .
assuming that pgl assumes the role of buyer under the terms of the land purchase agreement executed between pgl and air liquide on 4/11/2000 and pgl plans [P_99] to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing , perc and pgl should immediately begin [P_913] of the documents necessary to achieve the icc [P_916] of any future transfer ( sale , lease , or alternative structure ) of the torrence south parcel from pgl to torrence power llc .
this recommendation is based upon the belief that although the torrence south parcel does hold [P_95] to perc and enron as a [P_97] site , the overall viability and risk / reward profile of the commercial opportunity has not yet been sufficiently finalized .
the site ( in combination with the calumet project ) represents [P_93] component of [P_95] a commercial solution to the mission energy / comed 500 mw " in - city " regulatory obligation to the city of the chicago .
the factors contributing to the [P_91] perc and enron not [P_93] to [P_94] 6/26/00 are [P_96] :
the incomplete status of [P_91] commercial [P_92] associated with the torrence south parcel .
d. perc and enron 's desire to maintain the flexibility to minimize development costs while further developing the commercial [P_96] associated value proposition prior to executing an icc - approved land transfer from pgl to torrence power llc .
the south parcel represents a potential power plant [P_92] site upon which perc and enron [P_95] to conduct due [P_97] activities .
perc and enron shall [P_91] risk mitigation strategies including land options , environmental indemnifications , and other [P_96] which protect their respective assets and the overall economic viability of a [P_910] on the torrence south parcel .
perc [P_90] personnel have estimated that the icc [P_92] could require up to 6 months ( the transfer of the calumet parcel was " fast - tracked " and took 3 months to [P_911] icc [P_912] ) .
this risk [P_90] viability of an ' 01 in - service date for a torrence power llc [P_96] project .
perc and enron shall [P_91] develop a binding agreement which specifies an [P_94] and cost - sharing mechanism [P_96] decisions on the torrence south parcel .
such an agreement shall also specify a formula for the sharing of proceeds associated with the marketing / selldown strategy currently under [P_97] by perc and enron for all of the chicago [P_910] projects .

mark , i am [P_91] report that [P_92] extremely hard to collect all of the information that has [P_97] ( and then some ) for purposes of [P_910] due diligence [P_912] .
while [P_90] current situation with awano and seguchi we touched upon [P_94] reaction to our valuation and came upon a fundamental realization .
[P_90] enron [P_91] to [P_92] the assumptions we have utilized i still [P_95] share some fundamental [P_97] you in order to put this value into [P_910] .
in other words , if we were to flip [P_93] at financial close it [P_95] at least this much .
looked at [P_90] , discounting the npv back to 2001 at 15 % results in a current npv of $ 558 million , or more than $ 34 per current encom share !
[P_90] hard to believe [P_92] that your due diligence [P_95] bear them out .
[P_90] just these two [P_91] placing a ridiculously low 20 % [P_94] on them [P_96] the $ 3 per share of [P_98] our balance sheet gives you nearly $ 20 per share current value .
this is without considering oita or any of the other many [P_93] are [P_94] on .
if enron , with all of its [P_92] resources [P_93] , were to fully support encom on these two [P_96] believe that the [P_98] their [P_99] quite high .
( we have been receiving [P_91] support from the [P_93] group by the way )
this is also why i [P_91] that we focus our immediate attention on these two projects [P_95] perhaps the oita [P_97] .
i [P_90] agree that reaching a conclusion as quick [P_94] is in all shareholders interests .
my main concern continues to be that the current infighting between [P_93] and e power has limited enron 's ability to recognize 1 ) the quality and [P_99] capabilities of the employees of e power and 2 ) the [P_913] that has [P_914] through the nearly 2 years of systematic and comparative analysis of all of the potential greenfield sites in japan as well as the significant [P_920] with respect to brownfield developments .
within the [P_90] months [P_91] to [P_92] to take off of the market nearly three quarters of the most attractive [P_97] sites [P_98] leaving little for the late comers to the japanese market .

all are wondering whether deregulation can [P_92] - and whether benefits [P_93] broadly flow .
some industry insiders [P_91] these higher prices [P_92] spread to other deregulated states in [P_94] .
the cost to go into a [P_92] area and market [P_93] customers is so high while the return on residential customers is so low that the pursuit of residential customers just may not [P_911] it for non - incumbent utilities .
a fully deregulated [P_91] large numbers of residential and small business customers participating ... remains at least a couple of years away .
you have to [P_91] a discount and by the time you [P_93] a discount , then the spread between the actual price and the wholesale price is too [P_99] .
the state has imposed rate caps [P_92] ensure that residential customers ca n't be harmed by volatile prices .
while consumer groups [P_91] complain about high rates and some industry insiders may project a darker [P_95] residential customers , other experts saythe [P_98] is just a matter of a newly deregulated industry experiencing growing pains .
competition should live up to its promise of lower rates for everyone , but residential customers [P_95] to resign themselves to the fact that [P_98] - volume users [P_99] greater savings from deregulation than they will .

i had a [P_91] trena mcfarland today picking up on earlier discussions with respect to [P_95] for the softs business to be conducted out of london [P_99] ( [P_910] e : [P_912] 2/2/01 for detailed discussion of the alternatives ) .
trena said that there was a strong legal preference to use ena rather than a [P_95] us corporation for the trading activity conducted out of new york , and that ectric ( or [P_911] llc ) through eeft [P_912] the principal for uk trading activity .
as a result of this trena is considering establishing parallel books such that , for example , the london based traders would offer prices on nybot [P_98] - alike and the nybot / liffe spread trades as well as offering prices on the liffe [P_914] - alike trades .
the trouble with this route is that there is the [P_93] of arbitrage since the products [P_95] overlapping hours of trading .
the [P_90] of arbitrage [P_91] restricted to those counterparties which are registered both with london [P_95] york [P_96] eol and are thus [P_98] to see both prices with a bit of collusion - this [P_912] most likely in the case of a global counterparty which is operating through one or more branches .
this is only a [P_91] summary of the discussion and the issue , because i [P_95] to [P_96] detail in person when i [P_99] houston [P_910] .

international power was eventually agreed to be the reference entity because it had to take [P_95] debt at the time of the de - merger .
firms representing the key [P_91] the credit [P_92] on june 5 [P_94] back to the credit [P_96] practice committee .
an industry comment period [P_91] global capital rules dubbed " basel 2 " ends on thursday , but [P_96] just [P_97] for banks calculating how the sweeping [P_910] affect their businesses .
one reason for the haste is that the basel committee on banking supervision [P_94] new rules worries an industry stalemate could delay adoption of the badly - needed [P_99] rules in [P_910] jurisdictions .
banks complain basel 2 's calibration formulae , as spelled out in a draft published in january , penalise the irb approach , saying set - asides for risky corporates , for example , [P_911] higher than what is called for by a standardised approach applied for less sophisticated banks .
one fear is that [P_91] lead small and mid - [P_93] banks using the standardised approach to wind [P_96] a disproportionately [P_97] exposure to riskier borrowers .
supervisors are expected [P_91] out the kinks , however , and are expected to [P_95] account data collected by the basel committee under a quantitative [P_99] study ( www.bis.org ) .
but now [P_90] as though [P_92] changed .
the basel committee [P_91] analysing these [P_92] , and is likely [P_94] them into the finished version of basel 2 .
some private bankers worry that asking banks to set aside capital for such risk [P_94] adversely [P_95] the burgeoning business of wealth management which in theory requires a low capital base compared to lending or trading activities .
deutsche 's ' what - if positions change ' [P_93] , released to clients in mid - [P_95] , includes features to determine [P_97] in value at risk ( var ) , tracking error and surplus - at - risk resulting from a variety of hypothetical situations .
managers who [P_90] use of the client risk reporting [P_93] would have a [P_94] whether a particular position will better correlate a fund to an index , for example .
the current var analysis tools have already been mastered by the fund community , which is now [P_95] predictors of risk .
var is tied to a particular probability at present and fails to capture an [P_94] an index , for example , said guillaume blacher , senior managing director , pricing advisory and risk management .
more managers [P_90] the numbers , rather than have a single number that comes out once a day , " she said , referring to the benefits of scenario analysis over traditional risk measurement practices .
the hypothetical scenario tools , along with the traditional var risk measurement systems , [P_94] by fund managers in a complementary way , stated reech capital 's blacher .
hypothetical analysis tools will [P_91] risk manager in deciphering what positions [P_94] to get back within a fund manager 's limit , he added .
the [P_90] for [P_91] more reliable scenario hedging for managers investing in equity options has been a key driver of demand for ' what - if ' scenario analysis lately .
he also credits the more educated investor who [P_92] prompting the fund manager to install [P_95] risk management and reporting systems , particularly [P_98] based funds , as fuelling the current demand for hypothetical risk analysis .
however , the current risk measurement systems [P_92] expensive for all but the largest trading organisations , and especially for [P_97] - up funds .
the fact that these virtual portfolio hypothetical analysis tools are now [P_93] is beginning [P_94] for hedge funds [P_97] up , according to imagine 's cannon .
with the right risk analysis tools , a hedge fund [P_93] up and running in a week , instead of hiring an entire it staff , he said .
the fsa said the think tank -- which admits it began with negative preconceptions -- ended [P_95] some [P_96] conclusions .

while volatility levels dropped in the first [P_92] of the year due to supply and demand [P_95] , the past month has seen volatilities begin [P_98] up again .
[P_90] , with the current supply and demand imbalance , that vols [P_94] rise more significantly than they have , " he says .
the fact that vols have not risen in this way creates [P_93] value for those [P_95] use equity derivatives .

[P_90] , whilst there maybe the potential of mtm movement between the $ 180 purchase price from borealis and the subsequent sale ( index related price ) back to the counterpart , this [P_911] netted out .

if this is feasible i will [P_92] we negotiate a discount of $ 15 on storage costs ( saving $ 600,000 ) as opposed to $ 10 .
the likely [P_90] for selling the product [P_92] jan. 2002 as that is the highest otc swap price mkt which in turn would mean payment to borealis [P_99] due on 30 days past b / l.

based on your questions and [P_91] , [P_92] clarify the double match and share with [P_96] modifications we are making to the administration of the match .
doubling the match doubling the match will accelerate the rate at which company [P_94] contributions accumulate .
however , the annual company matching [P_92] remain limited to 50 percent of an employee 's pre - tax contributions , up to 6 percent of eligible compensation .
the company match in effect prior to its suspension was $ .50 for each $ 1 contributed , so the maximum amount the employee would have received in company [P_99] would have been $ 5,500 , or half of $ 11,000 .
with the double match , the same participant [P_92] $ 1 for each $ 1 contributed , but the match will not exceed $ 5,500 .
truing up " the match for previous [P_92] many participants in the plan expressed concern that contributions to the plan prior to july were not eligible for the reinstated company match .
[P_90] the end of 2002 , the matched amount falls short of the maximum level [P_95] based on the participant 's annual pre - tax [P_98] the plan , the [P_910] " true up " their match for 2002 to ensure the company [P_915] equal what would have been received had the match not [P_919] .
for example , if an active employee 's annual pre - tax [P_94] the [P_95] reach $ 11,000 , and on july 1 the employee has already contributed $ 7,000 , the remaining employee pre - tax [P_913] allowed [P_913] $ 4000 .
with the double match , the employee will receive $ 4,000 in company matching contributions between july and december , [P_96] be $ 1,500 short of the company [P_99]
after january 1 , 2002 any participants in the plan hired or re - hired after january 1 , 2002 , will not [P_97] for the double match .
however , at the end of the year , they too [P_93] a true up to reach the maximum company match [P_97] for their annual pre - tax employee contribution .
the total amount of company matching [P_92] , including any true up , [P_94] based on year - to - date contributions up to the time the participant is terminated .
if a plan participant resigns voluntarily , he or she is not eligible for a true up , [P_96] receive the double match [P_98] pre - tax [P_99] made to the plan between july 1 and his or her termination .
