[P_90] -(dow jones)- banks [P_95] [P_97] to tighten the coordination between credit risks they are exposed to [P_919] markets , as they [P_925] [P_927] requirements of the basel accord on capital requirements , a federal reserve study says .
specifically , the report cites exposure [P_96] as one [P_910] broader and more tightly [P_916] models of credit risk are [P_922] to [P_924] a [P_926] requirement for banks .
[P_90] [P_92] federal reserve study , entitled " using credit risk [P_912] regulatory capital : issues and options , " is [P_923] publication in a forthcoming economic policy review .
when questioned , hirtle said the study 's reference [P_99] and to [P_913] [P_915] some banks to tighten correlations among different [P_924] of credit risk [P_928] was n't based on specific [P_935] problems in the financial sector .
for positions that involve derivatives or that otherwise [P_98] to a material extent on market [P_915] , standards [P_918] [P_919] require [P_921] models of market movements and credit exposures , " the report said .
she also gave an example in [P_96] of how a chain of events [P_914] lower the worth of a credit for a bank .
[P_90] [P_92] the basel accord , [P_98] introduction by 2004 , aim [P_915] the way that banks globally [P_922] risk .
nobuaki kurisu , chief fund [P_95] sumisei global investment trust management , also cited derivatives -related selling as a factor in the stock market 's plunge , and added that such selling [P_933] market volatility high for the time being , making institutional investors [P_946] buy .
the rush to hedge equity linked derivative bonds , which usually [P_911] in six months to one year , [P_919] [P_920] rates than ordinary bonds if the nikkei stays above a pre - determined level .
but once the nikkei drops [P_95] that level , the return at the bond 's maturity [P_916] lower than [P_920] investment .
it is designed to serve as a kind of calculation device to determine who [P_914] file [P_916] 13 and who [P_921] file [P_923] 7 .
the bill now must wait until the senate passes its version before a conference [P_914] appointed [P_917] out [P_920] the two bills ( see related report in this section ) .
bonds that had previously been trading at a 60 [P_99] [P_910] suddenly [P_912] tendered at par .
[P_90] insurance [P_92] swaps stipulate that in one of several [P_911] events - the declaration of a bankruptcy ; the failure to pay [P_924] on a loan or bond , or the restructuring , repudiation or acceleration of a loan that lowers [P_943] creditworthiness of a counterparty - the buyer of [P_953] [P_955] deliver to the seller any loan or bond extending out to a predefined maturity , and receive back par value in return .
because of the product , loan portfolio managers [P_98] sides of the atlantic have morphed in recent years into active traders , while insurance company and hedge fund managers gained a [P_932] way to position themselves .
nobody wants to throw a company into bankruptcy [P_98] 's a glimmer of [P_914] a [P_917] turn around [P_921] .
since the loan was renegotiated on the last day of the contract , bofa certainly [P_915] considered it a repaid loan , and then extended a [P_927] loan if it had [P_932] couch it in such terms , " says one dealer .
that path [P_92] have avoided [P_95] default .
[P_90] [P_92] has effectively bifurcated itself into two distinctly [P_911] , and although it has n't yet [P_920] a critical stage , participants are concerned that this bifurcation [P_931] [P_932] hurt [P_935] market liquidity .
for example , [P_93] a bank give up its collection rights on a $ 20 million [P_916] swap if it had $ 1 billion in total loans [P_928] [P_930] thrown into the nonperforming category by a bankruptcy declaration ?
the conseco situation showed how a [P_96] default [P_98] trigger a credit derivatives exercise , but without the debt of the underlying company being truly hurt .
we have to establish a [P_95] standard for interdealer business , or risk less [P_914] a [P_917] of added basis risk within dealer books .
although [P_91] consensus [P_93] not [P_95] , kennaugh 's [P_910] that some standard acceptable to investors , hedgers and dealers alike [P_923] established .
the language to [P_93] [P_95] require some [P_98] drafting , but the goal [P_914] to give sellers of credit derivatives more solace that [P_925] not [P_928] blindsided on a loan restructuring with the delivery of longer - dated paper , while [P_944] of [P_947] swaps [P_950] still maintain the regulatory [P_955] tender restructured paper .
this compromise , however , [P_95] a " two - step delivery option .
on the occasion of a loan restructuring , the holder of a [P_912] swap [P_915] [P_917] either tender the actual loan affected or a similar short - term piece of debt , or hold onto [P_938] derivative for the [P_943] of an actual bankruptcy [P_948] at a [P_951] .
in other words , [P_94] [P_96] one central contract , but with a [P_914] delivery twist within it .
[P_90] [P_92] too much uncertainty into the delivery process .
given [P_91] [P_93] [P_95] underlying credits , however , the specific drafting required here [P_916] even more [P_920] participants to agree on [P_926] .
such an approach [P_93] result [P_95] [P_97] mismatches and basis risk on dealer books , but [P_917] [P_919] diverse end - user participants more satisfied .
people [P_91] what contracts they [P_96] trade , [P_910] [P_912] to wait [P_916] which contract [P_920] [P_922] .
if banks [P_92] relief with restructuring included , that price exists today [P_913] continue [P_916] .
a year ago , for example , xerox [P_98] swaps were trading at just 30 basis points per annum .
it 's easy to imagine yet another [P_97] xerox [P_910] technically fall into default on certain obligations , but continue to pay [P_923] on other paper .
lawsuits have n't sprung from the conseco situation , but [P_910] for xerox since there is more money on the table .
[P_90] credit problems flare up [P_96] , [P_98] [P_910] come under even more scrutiny , with conseco simply having been the first warning shot across the bow of [P_931] [P_933] .

this shows that [P_93] had [P_96] in our rpi [P_911] [P_912] , then the ppi [P_917] reflect those peaks and humps adequately .

dear all , [P_93] [P_95] [P_97] [P_99] brent crude as an explanatory variable for ppi ; it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from [P_930] - term average of $ 18.80 was [P_939] form of the variable to use ( for predictions the brent [P_952] [P_953] produced by the global products group is used ) .
[P_90] [P_92] , the two equations [P_98] in the [P_911] - [P_914] [P_916] - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term predictions of 3.0 % to 3.2 % over [P_941] six months .
this is only [P_93] the extent that we [P_99] positions beyond 2009 ( [P_915] do n't ) .

upon calling a special [P_94] , [P_96] oneok [P_99] about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters [P_918] [P_920] independent [P_923] analysis of the meters .
oneok has not called for a special [P_97] , [P_99] do so [P_913] [P_915] it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning .

while a " path " [P_95] either one line or a group of lines , it has a beginning and an end ( a por and a pod ) .
with respect to transmission grids , it [P_97] used to describe both paths and flowgates .
when i wrote " the more granular the [P_98] [P_99] " [P_911] , i meant " [P_916] the scale of [P_921] transmission [P_923] by flowgates " ; in fact , i had the " into wscc " example [P_939] at the time , whereby someone in the eastern interconnection [P_951] conceivably purchase a transmission right [P_957] energy westward to a sink anywhere in the western interconnection .
i hate to always burden [P_95] [P_97] , but you are knowledgeable [P_913] issues and i [P_918] get up [P_922] .
i guess i owe you a [P_96] beers now .
i 'll reply [P_93] [P_95] in the order you wrote them .
bp 4 says , in essence , " before you sell a transmission right , [P_915] [P_917] grid [P_919] it .
as written , [P_93] does n't seem to tie us to [P_912] transmission [P_915] , because the fragments [P_920] conceivably use any combination of physical and financial transmission rights .
we in the west have suggested a rewording of bp 1 , 10 and 12 ( hopefully , [P_918] [P_920] shared with the esc ) to allow regions [P_929] ours to minimize [P_933] [P_935] of changing the frequency and duration of non - emergency generator ramping .
as drafted , [P_93] [P_95] have no effect [P_99] practices in [P_913] , so more than one version of each bp [P_924] unnecessary .
i [P_91] say that bp 24 does not [P_98] the choice of congestion management method selected .
[P_90] , john , [P_95] valuable [P_98] .

[P_90] , [P_92] [P_94] u.s. on board and this leaves [P_912] the bush administration [P_917] an alternative -- though the [P_924] [P_926] [P_927] close [P_929] .
however , [P_92] have a role in complying with emissions reduction obligations .
it is too early to tell [P_96] [P_98] [P_910] competitiveness or whether they [P_915] interpreted as non - tariff trade barriers .
[P_90] , only parties to the protocol [P_97] [P_98] market - based mechanisms under the protocol ( emissions trading , [P_921] - mechanisms [P_925] countries through the clean [P_931] mechanism , [P_934] based mechanisms in other [P_940] through joint [P_944] ) .
because [P_91] are not yet [P_96] , it is unclear whether [P_913] [P_915] [P_917] in mechanisms or [P_922] offices in other countries outside the u.s.
[P_90] [P_92] [P_93] the u.s. [P_97] linkages with the market - based mechanisms to [P_916] a global market for greenhouse gas emissions credits and lower compliance costs for firms with obligations .

jeff johnson and his team are [P_96] a plan [P_910] address most of [P_915] and hopefully result in acceptable performance [P_923] go [P_926] bidweek and [P_930] close for august .

[P_90] [P_92] some user [P_96] [P_98] prior [P_911] [P_913] .
this puts quite a load on the pma and accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions [P_921] what [P_924] action [P_927] taken [P_930] transactions .
once [P_91] have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little time to absorb the tremendous growth we 've been [P_921] [P_922] then [P_925] [P_927] delivering more intermediate and [P_933] solutions .
[P_90] have to [P_94] it is the right solution in [P_912] term .

a [P_91] southern jet stream [P_96] spin up two [P_910] winter storms [P_914] [P_916] .
[P_90] [P_92] if only there was more cold air in [P_911] .
a cool and dry [P_94] seems to [P_97] shaping up for most areas , but a weak low [P_918] drop out of canada , across the lakes and toward [P_929] on sunday .
the current storm [P_93] drive out most of [P_99] [P_911] , but some lake effect [P_917] so some light snow amounts [P_924] occur .
however , the [P_93] [P_95] [P_96] [P_97] sort of low pressure [P_913] in the [P_917] the gulf coast [P_922] week .
[P_90] head toward the se us [P_97] [P_99] [P_910] factor .
it has had it for three runs in a row , but given the high surface pressures does not [P_919] as cold as i [P_924] have expected .
i [P_91] most areas to run [P_97] or slightly [P_910] .
we [P_91] going [P_94] [P_96] memo [P_99] .
finally , there are some conceptual points that i believe [P_910] discussed w/ relation to the [P_917] [P_918] " softs " trading we have been [P_927] .
i have [P_92] up [P_95] [P_97] whether i 'm going to [P_914] potholes [P_916] rt .

[P_90] in a [P_94] [P_95] , i [P_98] this report on the status of all ebs east asia regulatory affairs actions i am [P_925] , and [P_929] about [P_932] .
again , many , [P_94] [P_96] [P_98] [P_910] and for what i have learned about broadband [P_919] from each of you .
[P_90] not [P_93] [P_94] on the application until we decide what legal entity to use .
this is a [P_93] option in my opinion as the regulator ( ida ) does not [P_916] [P_918] at cross purposes with other parts of the government [P_929] [P_931] ebs with incentives .
for example it [P_93] that jan haizmann [P_98] [P_910] [P_911] a way to have actual trades escape the fee ( done offshore for example ) .
jan i [P_92] some [P_95] [P_96] that he adanced in the context of korea .
i believe [P_92] [P_94] prudent [P_97] [P_99] had planned to engage a law firm here in singapore ( [P_922] have in [P_926] and [P_929] ) for the purpose of guiding [P_936] these sorts of [P_941] ( or at least confirming our reading ) and answering the many [P_954] posed in a matrix [P_960] by a [P_963] group headed by wayne gardner .
the [P_91] i [P_93] [P_95] [P_97] andy haire and [P_912] yeo
i was to have gone to adl singapore [P_98] a meeting to question them [P_915] much of this they [P_921] to do independently without reliance on us .
so , to [P_93] pioneer status , which the [P_910] is [P_912] willing to consider [P_916] after many months of [P_922] , i [P_925] [P_927] [P_929] [P_930] demonstrate what the quantitative spin - off benefits are for singapore from our [P_944] bandwidth trading here ( e.g. increased [P_951] of capacity utilization , effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment ) .
the idea is to get adl to perform the quantitative economic [P_911] [P_912] [P_914] not do in - house .

the hk lawyers ( michelle chan of clifford [P_98] ) have said that [P_913] plan [P_916] [P_918] at the outset , we ought to [P_927] [P_929] in the correct description rather than revise .
when the system configuration plan is [P_96] final , [P_910] [P_912] change the listed destination in the [P_920] from " san jose " to " west coast usa , [P_932] , singapore , [P_936] " .
when we know what equipment we are going to [P_99] , tom wei [P_914] to revise the [P_918] and [P_920] [P_922] in destination referred [P_927] .

[P_90] are going [P_94] [P_96] one of the centerpieces of our asia ebs strategy , i [P_918] [P_920] consider devoting more full time ebs regulatory resources [P_930] exclusively .
the allocation problem is that whatever regulatory [P_97] apply have [P_911] on immediate license amendment and operational [P_919] that drive out time [P_924] effectively [P_927] term issues such as how to go about amending the telecommunications business law to allow bandwidth trading explicitly .

this agency , which so far exists just on paper , [P_911] used to [P_915] power plants [P_918] run a state - owned transmission system .
with the state locking up so much of california 's [P_910] power [P_912] , legislators openly [P_916] utility - rescue efforts are worth the billions of dollars they [P_929] require .
he credits [P_92] - term power contracts with [P_99] cool the spot market for electricity , where prices in recent weeks have dropped sharply .
that was down from $ 243 in [P_97] , though still far above the $ 25-to-$27 [P_916] two years ago .

while i [P_92] [P_94] walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone , i nonetheless [P_917] [P_919] of some [P_923] set forth a [P_928] preliminary focal points for [P_933] , [P_936] you do n't get to [P_943] a [P_946] .
i [P_91] made sense to [P_96] record [P_98] as i [P_912] [P_914] of [P_917] / positions .
also , i 'll have to run down the conflict issue when i [P_913] into [P_916] , but i [P_921] i [P_923] generally [P_925] ppa in [P_929] .
[P_90] , i did not know whether it was ena 's or dynegy 's obligation [P_916] on a response to cms , but i [P_926] made [P_929] [P_931] what one [P_935] [P_936] on paper .
[P_90] [P_92] , there are [P_96] underlying [P_99] .
while many of [P_93] computations are done on a [P_910] basis -- which generally supports mplp 's position -- the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a [P_931] basis results in two anomalies : namely , the stated capacity charge ( on exhibit d ) for " year 1 " only [P_956] for 3 months , but even more importantly , the capacity charge ( on exhibit d ) for " year 35 " [P_980] for the last 21 months of the contract term .
my [P_91] concern is that an arbitrator [P_97] [P_98] the anomaly ( [P_913] ) that results by applying exhibit d using a [P_924] concept ( i.e. , the 21 month " year 35 " issue ) since that is a fairly easy concept to get [P_948] around ..
[P_90] a [P_93] conclusion on the issue [P_98] made , we [P_913] [P_914] [P_916] or undertake , as the case [P_924] , [P_927] such as ( which i assume [P_935] generally obtain from the michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e - [P_949] forwarded ) : --the michigan puc presumably approved the ppa ( prior to the first amendment ) in a published order .
( [P_91] [P_93] [P_94] [P_96] to settle out the dispute on the basis that mplp [P_918] concede the issue on a [P_924] basis only ) .
certain points in support of mplp 's position --the definition of " contract capacity factor " provides for a [P_919] determination and , most importantly , provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the cod occurs that ends at the end of that [P_948] .

[P_90] [P_92] [P_94] [P_96] from [P_99] to [P_912] list , [P_916] [P_918] request to [P_922] office . )
[P_90] , the newly released [P_96] [P_97] the governor 's budget submission confirms the substantial revenue deterioration that is expected to emerge over [P_925] eighteen months due to the weak [P_933] sector and stock market .
[P_90] [P_92] commences what is [P_96] to [P_98] a difficult budget debate .
to date , the state 's general fund cash advances for power purchases total approximately $ 4 billion , and these advances are [P_923] to grow [P_926] in [P_929] months .
moody 's [P_92] the state 's ending cash [P_99] [P_911] $ 10 billion at june 30 , 2001 , including both general fund cash and internal " borrowable resources " , which represents cash [P_937] [P_939] borrowed by the general fund beyond the end of the fiscal year .
as a result , the state 's cash reserves are [P_910] to [P_912] depleted by the time long - term financing [P_922] secured .
[P_90] of the early 1990s indicates that a substantial portion of borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity .
we are currently assuming the state 's general fund [P_99] not [P_911] reimbursed by [P_915] of [P_918] - term financing , as such full reimbursement [P_928] reduce the amount of bond [P_934] [P_935] [P_937] power purchases , and require dwr to seek [P_946] increases during 2001 .
based primarily on the downturn in the [P_97] sector , which relies heavily on options in compensation packages , and the sluggish performance of the stock market and its adverse [P_931] on capital gains , the state has reduced its tax revenue [P_943] [P_945] year by approximately $ 5.4 billion , including a $ 2.7 downward [P_959] in the personal income tax .
the drop in these sources of income [P_97] temper growth in sales tax collections for [P_916] year .
the proposed budgetary reductions , along [P_96] spending levels for recurring items such as education , [P_917] lead to prolonged budget debate in [P_925] weeks .
while such budget negotiations [P_94] not necessarily [P_97] the [P_910] of the issuance of [P_915] - term power bonds , delay [P_923] [P_924] weaken the state 's fiscal position .
the energy crisis [P_93] economic , as well as financial , consequences that [P_914] uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook .
the drivers of the forecasts include the outlook for the [P_910] sector , as well as [P_917] housing sector .
in moody 's view , the forecasting [P_97] of the major economic services tend to underestimate [P_916] [P_918] of [P_920] [P_922] [P_924] of the energy crisis .
at the moment , [P_94] that the substantial cash resources accumulated by the state of california during [P_918] of the last decade , [P_925] with the planned long - term energy [P_934] [P_936] to avert the degree of fiscal damage [P_945] call for the rating to fall to the a [P_956] .
while [P_91] that the state [P_96] [P_98] [P_910] a viable long - term energy financing over [P_919] [P_921] , substantial obstacles must [P_927] [P_928] to meet that goal .

i realize the group [P_94] go a [P_97] [P_99] , but i remain convinced that [P_917] go to a pure number system ( ie a pure relative ranking ) and [P_933] behaviors [P_936] [P_938] as a way of [P_943] [P_945] people .

according to [P_92] remarks for a speech to [P_98] delivered at a central banking conference at the bank of italy in rome , clementi said [P_925] recording transactions in derivatives markets also [P_933] to [P_935] [P_936] to avert [P_939] shocks in financial markets .

he is also worried about how courts [P_97] countries [P_910] treat these contracts .
by andrea reierson consolidation in the global banking sector [P_99] it harder to keep swaps the preserve of the otc marketplace and [P_923] [P_924] onto a centralised exchange , the bank for international settlements ( bis ) said in its quarterly review .
this increasing concentration of swap books [P_96] spark strong pressure [P_910] listed on an organised exchange where counterparty risk is taken by the exchange 's clearing house , bis said .
bis also noted the market shift in fixed income benchmarks from government bonds to [P_914] - term [P_917] , particularly in the us .
trading [P_91] rate swaps has risen relative to futures and options trading in treasury [P_915] bonds with transactions in coupon - bearing us treasuries peaking in 1998 while those in private [P_933] continue to rise , the bis said .
the continued [P_92] the [P_95] [P_97] also underpinned demand for [P_913] products , typically the most common hedging [P_922] [P_924] swaptions .
nevertheless , though the effects of these excesses are [P_99] to [P_911] much of this year in the form of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings [P_927] of [P_930] banks , these problems , one [P_938] , [P_940] modest both by historical standards and relative to [P_950] of these institutions .
[P_90] to a request for comment related to [P_98] basel accord and an alternative proposal by the fed [P_919] [P_921] capital standards for u.s. banks show that most banks [P_931] basel accord , he said .
i [P_91] emphasize that we are still analyzing [P_98] many [P_910] [P_911] determine what kind of [P_917] [P_919] .
the [P_91] of creating a single ' master master ' agreement that covers [P_913] and financial products was actively discussed , with advocates citing such contracts [P_927] [P_928] efficiency by simplifying the negotiation [P_934] market operators .
doubts were expressed by some participants , however , regarding [P_910] [P_912] a ' master master ' contract , especially concerning administration , legal and negotiation [P_928] cross - affiliate master agreements .
[P_90] of the contracts introduced by established marketplaces in recent years have met with an [P_915] response , and the gains [P_921] by some contracts have largely reflected a [P_929] of business away from traditional benchmarks , " said bis economist serge jeanneau in the international body 's quarterly review .
a [P_91] [P_92] also took place in europe in the late 1990s , with eurex capturing business in [P_919] - term segment of the euro yield [P_928] liffe [P_931] dominance in [P_934] - term area , " said janneau in the report .
janneau believes the falling number of non - government [P_99] [P_911] [P_913] [P_914] to exchanges [P_918] contracts based on corporate and asset - backed securities .
examples of [P_92] [P_93] behaviour include the us bond market association 's [P_912] last september [P_915] proposals for a [P_920] futures contract , and cbot 's efforts [P_929] mortgage - backed contracts .

before considering [P_92] landscape , it is worth [P_99] various phases of the market during the [P_918] years .
nevertheless , despite the lack of highly leveraged [P_98] , companies throughout the region continued to fund long - term local currency [P_922] [P_924] term foreign currency (
corporate credit quality is slowly [P_95] and a recent trend has been the increasing use of derivatives by financial institutions - particularly local banks and fund managers .
this is expected to continue as [P_96] [P_98] leads to a [P_913] yield [P_916] credit risk management .
the emergence of domestic bond markets is having a [P_99] [P_910] [P_912] , both directly and indirectly .
there is a direct [P_94] where [P_96] are swapped into a different currency ( in the case of foreign issuers accessing a market ) , or [P_927] ( where issuers [P_932] alter the [P_936] basis ) .
additionally , the increased availability of [P_96] in the market [P_910] demand [P_913] from investors is leading [P_919] local currency products , such as options on domestic [P_930] rates and securities .
finally , derivatives regulation in the region has generally been somewhat mixed , [P_913] countries adopting a prescriptive approach and others a risk - based approach .
[P_90] turn requires [P_94] regulatory consideration , which has generally been in line with international standards .
[P_90] , it is reasonable [P_96] a mend towards regulatory harmonization and increasing adoption of international regulatory standards .
there has been [P_93] [P_94] as the number of users increases , more products become [P_915] regulations put in place to allow healthy [P_924] .
nevertheless , the derivatives markets [P_95] [P_97] [P_99] and [P_912] as end - users grow [P_918] and sophistication , while [P_924] [P_926] continues [P_929] .
but with [P_92] fourth financial markets [P_97] act [P_99] [P_911] light at the end of the tunnel .
it is , however , widely expected - or at least [P_911] - that [P_914] fourth financial markets [P_919] act [P_921] the introduction of a statutory definition of borsentermingeschafte .
its conceptual [P_92] is controvasial3 and the continuous [P_98] [P_910] types of transactions requires a provision which is as comprehensive [P_921] .
but the meager [P_93] provided by equity markets masked an [P_910] 28 per cent increase on volumes from levels last year , and a 14 per cent increase in exchange traded options .
use [P_91] rate agreements more than doubled during the year to $ 1 trillion making it the fastest growing market segment for the year .
` ` the [P_93] market was more volatile this year than last and that means there was greater underlying customer demand for [P_923] hedging , ' ' said mr. farrow .
` ` the market has [P_95] considerably .
bankers who [P_92] [P_94] the basle committee on banking supervision say it is [P_915] [P_916] [P_918] [P_920] banking supervisors : basic [P_926] ( that is , a single [P_933] the entire bank , such as trading volumes ) ; a business line approach using committee - imposed capital ratio ; or thirdly , internal measurement using a bank 's own loss data within a supervisory specified [P_972] .
the implication is [P_93] and [P_96] [P_98] the internal measurement approach [P_914] result an [P_917] of appropriate models and a fourth regulatory option , based on internal modelling .
the principal message to regulators is that [P_97] banks [P_99] operational risk measurement and management [P_916] [P_917] lower capital charges .
joseph sabitini , managing director in the corporate risk management group at jp morgan [P_914] [P_916] , recognises that a [P_921] [P_922] for operational risk must accommodate banks at all levels of sophistication in terms of risk measurement and management , but that it also includes a risk - based [P_952] " those with [P_957] [P_959] " .
stages three and four [P_94] to [P_97] for the measurement and management of those risks within a firm .
we have also looked at a number of quantification [P_99] , [P_911] their effectiveness [P_915] on the quality and quantity of [P_923] [P_925] .
the current challenge is to find a way around the lack of [P_912] big loss [P_916] .
according to tony peccia , vice - president in [P_99] risk management division at cibc world markets in toronto , most banks [P_923] to [P_926] the internal measurement [P_931] the proposed capital charge when implemented - which [P_941] on internal data .
the more consortium [P_93] to [P_96] sharing data from november 1 2000 and receive the first [P_917] scrubbed , anonymous [P_922] the end of the year .
the paper highlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach [P_99] [P_910] institutions with poor operational risk management [P_917] controls , but [P_922] to internal loss [P_927] data , to [P_931] a lower capital charge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but no access to internal loss [P_949] data .
the paper also highlights fears over [P_96] of calculation of operational risk [P_913] an institution that has recently [P_920] serious loss , but where [P_926] reacted and strengthened the control environment in [P_935] , and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence .
the paper argues blat there is [P_96] in the [P_910] a regulatory capital [P_915] [P_916] allows institutions managing operational risk to effectively access a more precise means of calculating an operational risk capital charge - institutions [P_939] [P_940] more sophisticated controls and the regulatory regime [P_949] establish incentives [P_952] risk management and controls .
insurance and risk transfer [P_94] become [P_96] and sophisticated component in an operational risk manager 's [P_917] - box over [P_921] [P_923] years .
although some [P_92] the [P_95] [P_97] immediate liquidity to a bank following a disaster , [P_917] [P_919] certain arguments after [P_923] .
rachlin also highlights reputational issues : " while insurance [P_99] cover [P_911] - term financial [P_916] [P_917] events the [P_921] reputation [P_924] [P_925] [P_927] concern .
insurance [P_91] a role as an instrument for managing operational risk , but not in its [P_917] .... we are waiting for the regulators .
victor dowd , an associate involved with operational risk capital charge [P_911] the uk 's financial services authority agrees [P_920] and [P_923] [P_925] the internal measurement approach [P_931] result in [P_934] of appropriate models .

enron officials spoke of the water business in much the same way they now talk about broadband : it 's a fragmented international market worth $ 300 billion a year , and [P_932] extend its [P_936] to this business and win a huge share of that market .

he [P_91] [P_93] [P_95] of a quantitative role [P_911] utilise his [P_915] [P_916] also his statistical and theoretical knowledge as well .
the issue is that he is based [P_97] and i [P_911] there [P_914] [P_916] from [P_919] headquarters there .
i [P_91] [P_92] [P_93] [P_94] replying to this [P_98] [P_910] know [P_913] intend to [P_917] a party to these agreements at this time .
[P_90] to [P_93] forecasting $ 1 mm under [P_99] the whole of energy ops for the year .
take the amount we [P_94] for q1 and the difference between that [P_913] $ 1 mm and apply it ratably to the remaining 3 quarters .
[P_90] [P_92] sit down for a [P_98] [P_910] , i [P_914] to do it .
at a minimum , i [P_95] [P_97] what [P_910] down [P_913] before it is final .

stacey , based on jeremy 's [P_96] [P_97] , [P_99] [P_911] [P_913] alternative [P_916] [P_918] keep the usd without [P_924] .
let 's assume the following : postid currency - usd postid otc int type crv - alternative arg [P_918] [P_920] deal currency - usd deal level [P_927] [P_928] - alternative arg [P_932] [P_934] results : the portcalc [P_939] [P_941] using the alternative arg [P_946] [P_948] .
with an output currency code of " usd " , [P_910] deals are booked in tagg to " aa int " for int ( [P_925] [P_927] ) , then portcalc [P_932] the [P_935] [P_937] you specify [P_940] postid .
these 2 books do satisfy [P_95] requirements , so [P_910] specify an alternate [P_915] [P_917] [P_918] postid , portcalc [P_923] pv with that [P_927] .
due to the high [P_94] that the argentine peso and the usd [P_912] not continue to [P_916] linked 1 to 1 , [P_922] to [P_925] valuing the portfolios using an argentina [P_932] [P_934] .
and i recall that you [P_95] [P_97] require [P_99] .
at this [P_92] [P_94] [P_96] to specify usd but pv at an alternative [P_916] .
[P_90] i though about was possibly adding a [P_99] currency called argusd and having it [P_916] alternative [P_919] [P_921] .
[P_90] [P_92] into the status of [P_98] on [P_911] so that [P_915] [P_917] [P_918] in cr ag and margin [P_924] if [P_926] [P_927] .

from our preliminary advice , i believe that [P_98] [P_910] [P_912] game similar to [P_917] in the [P_921] to avoid liability in various jurisdictions for violating trademark restrictions on the use of the terms olympics , sydney 2000 and the [P_944] .
[P_90] [P_92] [P_94] the games to most us residents as well as those european residents for [P_919] received the green light during the euro2000 research .
[P_90] [P_92] [P_94] [P_96] game to japanese residents so long as the prize has a value no greater than 100,000 yen .
[P_90] not [P_93] [P_95] the game to residents of australia or singapore ( see david minn 's e - [P_922] re australia ) .
[P_90] [P_92] [P_94] game so that it complies with australian law , it appears that [P_918] [P_920] required to seek a permit [P_927] a game such as this ( notwithstanding [P_936] issue ) in australia .

there is zero [P_93] us getting [P_97] use sydney olympic names and images .

[P_90] units [P_93] lower fuel costs ( for example ) , but higher [P_915] costs [P_917] of the capital assets .

[P_90] [P_92] on wednesday , september 19 , by tim belden and [P_914] [P_916] on the [P_920] a [P_923] all you 've [P_928] enron this month .
i [P_91] see destiny 's child , what about you ?
i [P_91] [P_93] too .
and i [P_92] 's a [P_96] [P_98] [P_910] a ruling .
[P_90] a suggestion for a [P_96] folder , [P_99] the suggestion [P_913] [P_915] [P_917] esource bulletin , the source .
do [P_91] us [P_94] [P_96] with the rest of mario 's positions ( under the distillates - products ii ) or leave it with crude ?
we have discussed [P_93] the systems group [P_98] [P_910] the fix in [P_915] wednesday reporting - they must [P_922] [P_924] behind the scenes .
[P_90] me a [P_94] [P_96] [P_98] [P_910] [P_912] .
after a string of weaker - than - expected economic data , friday 's [P_914] came in stronger [P_919] .
on the surface , this suggests [P_96] the economy ; however , the drop was caused by a decline in the number of people [P_925] jobs .
* net net , [P_94] see a [P_98] [P_99] outlook for jackup oriented companies .
[P_90] [P_92] a long cycle , [P_98] utilization and rising day rates over [P_916] three or more years and highly attractive valuations .
* as [P_92] business signals are mixed and stocks remain volatile , we 're taking a 12 month view that trends for ems in 02 [P_926] [P_928] significantly .
while [P_91] see [P_94] weakness in share prices [P_99] , [P_912] [P_914] position themselves for the eventual rebound , and calling the bottom has [P_928] difficult .
from a micro sense [P_94] top - tier ems cos [P_911] [P_912] 20 % top and bottom line growth in 02 , y / y , [P_927] outsourcing wins .
[P_90] wins are positioning altera [P_95] a recovery when the inventory is gone but [P_915] question is [P_919] [P_921] that take and what is the slope of that recovery .
demand during the [P_93] determine [P_96] of [P_99] [P_911] change .
in our view , some of these stocks have begun to discount a fundamental recovery that is not yet fully substantiated by [P_922] ; however , the intermediate - term outlook has become somewhat [P_935] and ( perhaps more importantly ) current valuations of certain stocks in our coverage universe still leave [P_954] incremental upside appreciation [P_959] over [P_961] year or more , particularly after the modest pull - back that the group [P_977] over the last [P_981] a half .
[P_90] that the spx and ndx [P_97] a [P_910] [P_912] cuts .
while [P_91] the company continues to effectively [P_98] its business and have a high level of confidence in ceo paul charron , we recognize that the [P_927] senior management is unsettling and believe [P_935] of the situation [P_940] a [P_943] the shares .
revenues of $ 17.0 m easily exceeded our $ 16.1 m [P_911] , driven by continued strong sales into the softswitch ( internet offload and voip ) and wireless application markets .
visibility at the company remains [P_95] , with backlog continuing to exceed one q of revenue .
[P_90] fine although i [P_95] [P_97] to spending [P_911] out of the house .
i [P_91] bill and i [P_96] [P_98] well .
i am a little frustrated with the schedule that we are on which seems to [P_915] day to [P_919] hopefully [P_922] approach normalcy in a [P_928] .

and i [P_92] detailed directions [P_96] .
[P_90] those that showed up yesterday .
casey was a first - round draft choice and shaun [P_910] have been if he had been healthy .
[P_90] [P_92] , he cited the departure of kris stockton , who handled all the kicking duties last [P_919] , and said [P_923] a [P_925] kicking [P_927] [P_929] a key [P_932] a succesfful [P_936] .
tubbs had 5.5 sacks and 10 other tackles for losses and showed [P_912] promise for [P_915] .
he and most of the other defensive tackles are [P_99] and [P_911] than hampton and rogers , [P_917] [P_919] front four show a lot of [P_927] pass rushing .
the tackles this year wo n't [P_96] [P_98] against the run as hampton and rogers , who were run - stoppers deluxe , but they [P_926] [P_928] [P_930] , and , lets face it , [P_939] [P_941] on the ut regular - [P_947] schedule are geared to passing .
but let 's [P_93] some of the walk - on kickers the ut staff rounded up after the spring problems surfaced [P_921] kick field goals .
if they ca n't , and if this team is as [P_911] it has a [P_916] [P_918] , brown [P_921] himself in the same boat as florida state coach bobby bowden , who lost a couple of national championships in the 1990s because he did n't have guys [P_951] [P_953] a chip - shot field goal when the game was on the line .
i 'll report on them [P_95] in my [P_99] newsletter .
they are supposed to [P_94] [P_96] , and they [P_910] to [P_913] .
brown said the longhorns [P_94] more [P_97] this year and [P_911] [P_913] team .
so , instead of picking the southern and northern divisions , i 'm going to pick the way i [P_919] big 12 [P_923] up , from top to bottom , as a single entity .
brown says he is n't going to get caught up in pre - [P_913] hype this year because it does n't [P_921] sense [P_923] [P_925] how a [P_929] do when it has n't even started practicing .
the doctors told me i [P_95] [P_96] [P_97] again in three or four weeks
and , if i [P_94] any games , [P_98] n't [P_911] than the first one or two .
the longhorns were already thin at defensive end , and [P_910] [P_912] critically short if mcclintock is [P_918] a [P_921] period of time .
he did a tremendous job making [P_96] to defensive end ( from linebacker ) in the spring and is a guy we [P_923] [P_925] this [P_928] .
he said he [P_93] go to a school where he has a [P_913] [P_914] log some playing time .
if the injury does cost mcclintock [P_96] playing time , the coaches [P_912] some moves [P_916] more [P_919] .
incoming freshman eric hall , who had been ticketed forfullback , [P_911] a [P_914] candidate for a switch to defensive end .
[P_90] 've got to do a [P_97] day to day and week to week .
but he also said the coaches plan to play [P_99] players at each position .
if benson lives up to all the hype and if none of the other tailbacks emerge [P_916] , i [P_919] 'll play and play a lot early in [P_929] .
we were just [P_93] [P_95] you [P_98] and [P_911] go to georgetown .

if [P_91] passes , [P_95] have one [P_99] year to [P_912] a voluntary emissions reduction permit ( [P_920] ) .
[P_90] it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly cindy morphew of txoga and celina [P_919] of atingp - that [P_924] as though [P_928] get [P_931] [P_933] [P_935] facilities permitted without having to use today 's bact .
if that attempt is successful , [P_96] to [P_99] a [P_912] [P_913] gone on september 1 .
i am not certain [P_94] [P_96] [P_98] [P_910] .
[P_90] , i 've appended [P_96] on 10-year old bact for gas - fired ic engines and turbines [P_920] [P_922] [P_924] are trying to get a [P_931] now .
if while processing the application , the commission determines [P_99] information is necessary [P_914] or to take final action on the application , the [P_926] request the information and set a reasonable deadline for a response .
the owner or operator of a grandfathered facility [P_98] [P_99] a permit to operate the facility under this section .
the [P_91] issue an [P_95] facility [P_97] [P_98] some or all of the grandfathered [P_916] a site .
the commission by rule [P_94] designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission [P_919] [P_921] required than in [P_925] , but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate [P_939] required in any area .
because control technology for nox emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is [P_914] , it is doubtful if [P_921] control [P_923] [P_925] the permit system at this time .
i believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the trncc [P_915] to [P_918] [P_920] of guidelines for 10-year bact for grandfathered engines and turbines [P_932] in the [P_936] program .
grandfathered engines and turbines that [P_95] to [P_98] controlled to the 2 - 8 gram [P_916] [P_917] not [P_919] subject to an economic reasonableness review .
grandfathered engines and turbines that are not [P_97] [P_99] controlled to the 2 - 8 gram [P_917] [P_918] permittable under a [P_923] [P_924] [P_926] data [P_929] the old ( pre - modification ) [P_938] ( post - modification ) emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions [P_955] achieved .
also [P_91] [P_92] a representation of the cost of the controls and even though [P_915] modifications [P_917] , [P_920] cost is prohibitive .
i [P_91] all of this is [P_96] .
[P_90] [P_92] [P_94] [P_96] know .
, you asked for an example of [P_97] [P_99] consider " [P_912] emission reductions " [P_916] [P_918] in a case - by - case review when the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level [P_940] not [P_942] .
also [P_91] the case - by - case review [P_910] a representation of what the cost of the controls [P_921] with a discussion of why the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level [P_939] not [P_941] .
[P_90] [P_92] [P_94] limitations such as no [P_910] controls or modifications [P_914] , [P_917] [P_919] identify cost in dollars per [P_925] nox controlled to show that even though [P_934] modifications [P_936] , the cost is prohibitive .
after my first read , [P_95] [P_97] .
at that time older rich burn engines [P_97] been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g / hp - hr limit for nox .
the 10 year old bact [P_95] these engines and turbines [P_911] to [P_914] on a case - by - [P_922] just [P_925] [P_927] have done 10 years ago .

[P_90] recall at the wspp meeting in colorado i asked mike small if he [P_915] n't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups .
i [P_91] to get [P_95] take on the following kind of big picture enron policy on wspp approach .
every amendment that has been made in the past two years [P_911] agreements [P_914] and [P_916] into [P_918] and it is preposterous [P_923] serious lawyer to argue that we [P_931] off with two agreements , one that is almost [P_942] the other one .
the wspp [P_92] focusing on more boondoggles and more [P_910] [P_911] [P_912] [P_913] [P_914] for rto west , dealing with the emerging california [P_925] , and open access in oregon and nevada .
therefore , this policy [P_94] let our marketers praise the wspp for being a [P_914] organization , but at the same time , advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to [P_940] [P_942] .
rosman [P_91] : enron loves the wspp , it has done a [P_913] with the contract reformation , that task is done , we now [P_927] [P_928] to [P_931] [P_933] tasks .

with end - of - the - year loads firmly in place , most players expected little in the way of price movement over [P_924] week .
the urgency generated by pressure from the davis administration to sign long - term agreements precluded the [P_917] necessary [P_919] of such large - scale , according to the report , and resulted in the omission [P_937] [P_939] [P_940] [P_942] shielded california in [P_947] of failure by the supplier to deliver the power , or in times of excess demand .
this alone [P_92] consumers as much as $ 4 billion over [P_912] decade .
temperatures were slightly [P_93] but above freezing , and expected to remain that way through christmas .
weather forecasts called for temperatures to dip to slightly [P_99] over [P_912] in phoenix , while the latest six - to - ten from [P_926] was predicting [P_930] - [P_932] for the entire desert region for the last week in december .
temperatures were [P_92] by weather services corp. to warm into above - normal territory by christmas day , while the latest six - to - ten called for temperatures from [P_930] [P_931] - normal between december 27 and 31 .
temperatures lingered between the mid 20s and the high 30s on friday , but were expected to warm into the high 40s by the end of [P_926] , [P_929] shaving off heating demand for monday .
the latest six - to - ten [P_97] temperatures to [P_910] [P_911] [P_912] normal from december [P_917] 31 .
serc traders were scrambling [P_94] what [P_97] before everyone else stampeded from their offices for the christmas holiday , and [P_922] had any trades to report .
wednesday showed more strength , with into tva trading at a slight premium [P_913] 's goods , from 22 to 22.5$/mwh , and into entergy pieces trading from 22 to 24$/mwh .
temperatures were not expected to ratchet up heating demand over [P_910] five days , for despite [P_917] - [P_919] across much of the region , daytime highs were [P_930] [P_932] [P_933] 50s .
and i believe they [P_94] [P_96] [P_98] [P_910] [P_912] quest [P_915] domination .
we are not worried if they [P_96] go that way - the budget [P_914] way out of line though ( but they do [P_925] tell us to stop [P_931] we are [P_935] them ) .

i [P_91] kirk steven 's this afternoon and after [P_910] our preliminary closing [P_915] for power cost [P_919] , our june current [P_925] of power cost , and the amount of [P_934] ( 25 million ) we had targeted for the second quarter here is [P_948] concluded based upon the assumption that prices [P_957] do not continue to degrade [P_964] levels [P_967] have over the last month .
there are two sensitivities to this [P_96] [P_98] [P_99] number by a combined 6.5 million .
first we understand that [P_94] [P_96] charges for the tomas [P_912] ran through the pgg books last year .
[P_90] have to write - off these costs in the second quarter since the software [P_916] only have value in a peoplesoft system environment .

[P_90] , [P_92] to persons having the titles listed [P_910] 262 ( above ) , the general view is that persons having titles such as general manager and division manager ( bucho ) , [P_936] deemed to have the authority to represent the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the company 's [P_958] which they are responsible .
in formulating an approach for enron to take on the basis of [P_912] law , the following [P_918] relevant : ( a ) practice regarding representative director seal
as in many other countries , the answer [P_98] [P_910] as those noted in ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) [P_927] , which vary company by company .
( e ) degree of exposure to the extent that [P_910] products to [P_914] [P_915] are [P_918] to expose the counterparty to considerable liability , the [P_928] of a counterparty in [P_933] disclaiming liability [P_937] not [P_939] discounted [P_941] warrant a reasonably conservative approach .
for example , if it was sent to the general manager of [P_912] department , but the application came from a section chief , there [P_926] strong argument that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary authority .
since the law concerning [P_94] a representative director [P_99] considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning [P_919] under seal in some countries , and by two directors [P_930] example
[P_90] , [P_92] [P_94] for enron to take a more stringent approach [P_914] in this respect than it does [P_922] the same products in other countries .
the procedures in place for other countries [P_97] [P_99] [P_911] well , although some adjustment [P_918] to [P_921] made for [P_924] 's [P_926] regime of company titles .
less conservative approach major companies for major [P_97] companies , banks , insurance companies and other companies of equivalent [P_920] , the following approach [P_925] adopted [P_928] not [P_931] of line with market practice :
[P_90] companies for other companies [P_95] [P_97] as set out in 6 . above .

sme lenders ' [P_93] concerns included the steepness of basel 's credit risk weighting [P_914] the internal ratings - based ( irb ) approach , its insistence that [P_929] provisions [P_932] made [P_935] to typical unexpected loss provisions , confusion over which sme loans [P_948] included under the retail approach , and the extent to which physical collateral [P_963] used as a risk mitigant .
the basel committee has since issued a paper , ' [P_910] modifications to the committee 's proposals ' , [P_919] [P_921] within the committee and indicates that [P_929] [P_931] key concessions to sme lenders .
we have got [P_93] maturities , [P_97] put german banks at an enormous competitive disadvantage compared with other countries , " says winkler .
what kills a bank is deterioration of value , and it has got [P_913] for a lot of things on the books , so you ca n't wait [P_929] default , " said a basel committee member .
he said his hands were all but tied on the maturity debate , and confirmed that the german side [P_919] [P_921] to scupper basel ii 's [P_927] [P_928] a deal fail to [P_933] .
i have [P_92] imagining that [P_95] [P_97] basel ii in europe and not have a level playing field on a g-10 basis .
while hofmann said the matter was " [P_97] serious " , he remained [P_913] all sides [P_917] a solution .
asked if the us [P_94] agree such a concession , he added , " i [P_916] n't say that [P_920] , but [P_924] [P_926] the whole package .
another area [P_92] compromise is to allow banks with loan maturities of less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment , while banks with loans of more than three [P_933] [P_935] capped at the three - year level - as factored into the current proposed standardised credit approach .
how big [P_92] the [P_94] effect [P_97] smes ?
the paper proposes that a function based on the relationship between asset correlation and [P_914] [P_915] added to the irb risk - weight [P_924] methodology based on the relationship between asset correlation and [P_934] default .
retail businesses and wholesale businesses [P_95] similar turnover , but the characteristics and the [P_915] [P_917] [P_918] them [P_920] terms [P_923] [P_925] , " says colin jennings , senior manager , non - retail related risk at lloyds tsb , the uk 's third largest bank .
the committee believes banks [P_94] put aside [P_97] expected losses [P_911] to the current practice of making capital charges against unexpected losses - credit risk .
we fear that [P_93] lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for german banks because of tax regulations , [P_920] [P_922] much against covering expected losses with regulatory capital .
[P_90] [P_92] to use isda resources [P_98] [P_910] the [P_913] [P_914] 2.0 and [P_918] [P_920] 3.0 , ' he says . '
the standards committee ended up doing a lot of the administration [P_911] run the [P_915] symposiums , [P_918] [P_920] leverage off isda conferences ( [P_927] symposiums ) .
[P_90] have [P_93] on [P_96] then converting that into xml , [P_914] has a natural [P_919] isda , " says meinel , operating from inside [P_930] [P_932] [P_934] [P_936] [P_937] aligned with [P_941] [P_943] [P_945] it comes along .
strain robert pickel , isda 's chief executive officer , says the merger [P_913] members of [P_917] [P_918] on [P_921] [P_922] .
we envision adding [P_93] staff , [P_97] [P_99] [P_911] [P_913] to [P_916] extra funding [P_920] through due - based revenues ' says pickel .
creating [P_91] is as [P_94] the isda [P_98] agreement , because [P_913] strengthen [P_916] for [P_919] negotiation .

it [P_91] to [P_94] central downtown since giron is on the south side .
leading european and us banks [P_95] [P_97] how [P_910] rules on capital adequacy [P_915] operate , raising the [P_920] final proposals from the basle committee [P_928] delayed .
they are also asking [P_94] [P_96] the way operational risk - unexpected losses - [P_916] treated , and [P_921] on aspects of securitisation , counterparty risk and disclosure .
the letter points out that in a number [P_98] [P_910] basle committee 's second consultation document has either [P_920] [P_922] proposals or indicated that final proposals are to come .
" taken [P_92] greener [P_95] have a critical [P_910] the outcome of [P_915] for individual firms and the industry as a whole , " the letter says .
we [P_91] concerned that if the [P_97] is not done properly , [P_913] go up and [P_918] have a serious effect on the economy , " the european banking federation said .
the basle committee last night welcomed the banks ' [P_99] but expressed [P_912] the year - end [P_918] [P_919] maintained .
while [P_91] [P_92] being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk management and regulatory oversight of highly leveraged institutions ( hli ) , credit providers [P_926] [P_928] [P_929] [P_930] the measurement of credit exposures , a global banking watchdog said friday .
although a separate study [P_94] [P_96] out a basis [P_911] in public disclosure of financial risks has [P_920] , actual [P_924] [P_926] mandatory public disclosure requirements for hlis and hedge funds has been limited , the fsf report said .
at the same time , [P_95] have been made by senior management in terms of reporting on hli exposures , general standards of [P_923] , due [P_927] [P_929] , the fsf reported .
and foreign exchange market [P_94] agreed to a set of so - called [P_914] practice guidelines for foreign exchange trading .
[P_90] [P_92] address concerns that large and concentrated hli positions [P_911] [P_913] to materially influence market dynamics [P_920] and medium - [P_925] open economies , according to the fsf report .
while [P_91] being made in addressing weaknesses in legal [P_910] practices , it has proven difficult to [P_918] [P_919] the consistency , where appropriate , between different industry standards , the report added .
while [P_91] [P_92] being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk , management and regulatory oversight of so - called highly leveraged institutions ( hlis ) , credit providers [P_930] [P_932] [P_933] [P_934] the measurement of credit exposures , the global banking watchdog said .
disclosure of information by hlis to banks and other credit providers has [P_912] in terms of both quality and quantity , the bank for international settlements said last week .
by enoch yiu nine investment banks have voiced opposition to the proposed securities and futures bill , saying [P_918] for derivative trading disclosure are tougher than elsewhere in the world .
the banks said they feared the legislation [P_97] discourage international investors from trading in [P_914] shares , undermining the sar 's position as an international market .
however , they [P_93] to do so under [P_99] law as it expands the disclosure requirement from shares [P_920] derivatives .
the stricter disclosure requirement [ in the bill compared with ] international practices [P_913] [P_915] [P_917] to reduce manipulation activities , " she said .
[P_90] netting provisions [P_94] a [P_97] [P_98] otc products has been a priority for the international [P_919] derivatives association and the bond market association ( bma ) since the mid1990s .
in two high - [P_94] [P_95] 1999 by the president 's [P_912] group - one [P_916] - term capital management and one on otc derivatives regulation - us regulators acknowledged that [P_933] netting law [P_937] reduce systemic risk .
the definition [P_92] has been stretched to cover [P_99] rate agreements , [P_913] foreign exchange contracts and other [P_919] .
friction [P_91] between [P_93] and securities contracts with regard to netting across them , " says dan cunningham , a [P_921] allen & [P_925] [P_926] [P_928] isda 's legal counsel .
[P_90] have [P_93] collateral and an array [P_98] [P_910] for [P_913] harbour " netting and settlement [P_919] much [P_922] [P_924] under [P_927] bill , he adds .
the organizations sought the overturn of a decision rendered late last year in the u.s. district court for the southern district [P_921] [P_923] .
the three groups contended that because a [P_97] [P_99] [P_911] [P_912] market price of a futures contract , the imposition of ' " any continuing duty to furnish all price information and [P_935] all facts [P_939] [P_940] the market price [P_945] so burdensome as to [P_951] unreasonable .
the narrow [P_92] of a broker 's duty to a nondiscretionary [P_911] [P_912] [P_914] applies fully to a futures broker , the groups wrote .
the eurobond market was a response to a [P_98] withholding tax on [P_912] to overseas investors in dollar bonds .
[P_90] originally used for hedging in commodity markets became a large - scale financial phenomenon .
at [P_91] of 2000 , [P_96] otc derivatives amounted to $ 2,800bn according to the bank for international settlements , or just over half the value of [P_928] international debt securities .
[P_90] there [P_92] a limit to the efficiency gains [P_99] [P_911] wrung from the global financial system through innovation ?
[P_90] [P_91] such as credit derivatives are growing fast , although central bankers worry about their robustness in a downturn .
either way , [P_93] always [P_96] [P_97] [P_98] efficiency in the financial system .
while portfolio regulations for private pensions [P_96] regulatory arbitrage [P_910] derivatives , the [P_914] for innovation is less obvious than [P_921] to floating exchange rates and financial liberalisation .
but only a visceral optimist [P_95] assume that financial innovation [P_910] at the pace of the past quarter - century .
airlines , [P_92] concentrated in a particular hub , [P_910] weather derivatives more actively since inclement weather [P_919] [P_920] many more delays than they are used to , [P_930] claudio ribeiro , head [P_935] products [P_938] , weather risk management group , enron .
the way to [P_93] is by entering into [P_99] [P_911] limits .
weather has n't presented itself to - date to [P_99] sufficiently fungible [P_912] to [P_915] a broad market on , yet it 's a pretty big market nonetheless , " adds robert levin , senior vice - president , [P_940] control [P_943] , at [P_946] [P_948] exchange .
since september 1997 , when the first weather derivatives trade occurred , the market [P_914] an estimated 4,500 weather transactions [P_921] than us$ 6bn .
through the otc market , [P_95] [P_97] kind [P_910] , " ribeiro says .
to compensate , a realistic hourly weather [P_97] engine [P_99] [P_911] replicate thousands of multi - regional weather [P_920] , said rookley .
[P_90] [P_91] were that the treasury 's [P_97] a fortnight ago [P_911] [P_912] societies to embrace synthetic securitisations - and thus [P_922] fuel [P_924] market growth .
on [P_91] examination , those [P_95] seem to [P_98] fading .
also , the assets [P_94] for synthetic securitisation [P_98] small , " said chris carman , a vice - president within jp morgan 's structured products group in london .
while some [P_92] building societies [P_95] candidates for synthetic securitisations because they are cheaper and require less [P_918] than traditional securitisations , others [P_924] not have concentrations large enough to warrant the use of synthetic securitisations .
[P_90] building societies [P_94] [P_96] viable candidates for synthetic securitisations , [P_913] not [P_915] to [P_918] infrastructure required to otherwise actively trade credit derivatives , noted janet tavakoli , executive director and head of structuring [P_939] [P_941] derivatives at westlb in london .
building societies [P_92] to [P_95] securitising an asset pool of more than e500 m to warrant entering into the transaction because the cost of [P_925] these transactions is quite [P_931] , other industry officials said .
a building society 's [P_94] use credit derivatives hinges [P_910] [P_912] on a bsc - created spectrum that assigns eligibility based on criteria such as sufficient [P_929] using derivatives and adequate systems to capture and [P_939] credit derivatives business .
an institution ranked in the middle of the five - tier spectrum [P_912] to apply and [P_917] a strong case for why [P_924] [P_926] to use credit derivatives .
building societies are most [P_94] to use synthetic securitisations [P_99] product areas as a way to transfer out the risk related to a [P_924] or for [P_928] risk of higher - weighted assets , industry officials said .
[P_90] [P_92] building societies to use credit derivatives occurred because the bsc 's regulatory jurisdiction over building societies is being transferred to the fsa in november .
according to some industry officials , building societies ' current practice of using insurance to reduce borrower risk [P_918] turn out to [P_922] prompts them to [P_927] credit [P_930] .
[P_90] , credit derivatives [P_94] the place of mortgage guarantees .
the societies have [P_93] to [P_96] [P_98] and foreign exchange derivatives .
it has been a [P_94] quarter for the big us energy trading firms .
[P_90] [P_92] [P_94] capacity , which [P_99] inventory of [P_913] capacity [P_915] low - cost , high - value optionality in a highly volatile market - place , " skilling said .
audit david yeres , a partner specialising in derivatives law at clifford [P_912] rogers & wells [P_916] [P_918] , says : " a number of our clients have asked us to do a contract audit in response to the scrutiny management is [P_943] these exposures and the adequacy of [P_951] .
he adds : " [P_94] [P_96] [P_97] upgrading our contracts , we 're analysing our contracts in light of market [P_922] our [P_925] california .
clifford [P_91] 's yeres expects that i the california crisis [P_910] accelerate acceptance of more - sophisticated master agreements .
for instance , [P_93] [P_95] [P_97] [P_99] using collateral threshold [P_914] guarantees , or any type of [P_922] mechanism .
i know a lot of the suppliers [P_97] quite a bit [P_912] language for transactions with the california department of water ,
however , the concepts contained in the eel master that are similar to those in the isda master agreement . which has stood [P_923] of time and been proven in court .
isda itself has an initiative under way that , [P_99] , [P_912] [P_913] energy marketers operating in california .
it [P_91] at [P_94] [P_96] master agreement to cover [P_912] and financial transactions .
haedicke , who is [P_94] board member and chair of the energy [P_913] products committee [P_917] this , says : " [P_924] [P_926] a much [P_929] world [P_932] [P_934] a way to [P_939] isda master [P_943] physically and financially settled transactions , and find a way to net across physical and financial collateral collateral is another area being scrutinised in the wake of the california crisis .
under the concept of " adequate assurances " [P_98] [P_910] , a party to a [P_917] with " reasonable " grounds to [P_925] insecure about [P_928] of its counterparty to fulfill its responsibilities [P_937] demand performance assurance such as collateral .
[P_90] [P_92] , some energy traders [ have ] [P_910] to terminate and close - out [P_918] an earlier stage than others using the so - called ' early termination events '
the costs and [P_93] costs of [P_96] this debacle [P_910] that the lessons of the california crisis [P_919] remembered .
isma said these bodies [P_94] [P_95] [P_97] a constructive way [P_912] a more harmonised security settlement environment in [P_921] " substantially reduce " the number of failed transactions .

[P_90] , i felt we made a lot [P_98] .
at the end of the call , [P_97] said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was [P_921] , but at the end he said that he [P_931] [P_933] [P_935] through a number of [P_940]
we said that [P_93] [P_95] [P_96] to modify our [P_910] [P_912] reflect some of the concepts [P_919] about and that [P_924] then " [P_928] [P_929] .

right that has been offered , it was discussed that [P_910] [P_912] in such a way that epmi [P_920] walk from the deal ( without receiving or paying a termination payment ) up until a date certain ( september 1 and september 30 were mentioned by me as [P_950] , although [P_953] said that other suppliers had a [P_960] window )
[P_90] said he [P_93] cdwr [P_95] [P_97] on that .
however , he said cdwr [P_95] willing to consider having a downgrade [P_913] a " no ld walk right " [P_921] and perhaps [P_925] justifying epmi in suspending deliveries .
in other words , a downgrade [P_96] [P_97] treated [P_910] [P_911] of default , but no termination payment [P_920] owed and epmi [P_925] have [P_927] to suspend performance .
however , when asked about the idea of a cross default out w / out a termination payment , he stated that he [P_923] [P_925] [P_927] with cdwr .

the recent dramatic rise in energy prices in the [P_99] caused some generators of the spent solvents [P_918] [P_920] the feedstock for this facility to [P_927] these streams for fuel .
a reevaluation of this situation is underway at the [P_99] and the decision as to [P_916] of this [P_920] [P_921] made in late first quarter of 2001 .
[P_90] , although much more capital intensive than [P_99] , has been separated from [P_916] iv for several reasons : 1 .
in contrast to this , the permits for the reclamation of the hazardous chlorinated solvents , [P_916] iv , [P_919] between ten and eighteen [P_925] [P_927] well .
the technology to [P_93] employed and the absence of corrosive compounds in [P_912] [P_914] iii [P_917] [P_919] and piping to [P_924] fabricated out of common carbon steel rather than the exotic alloys , [P_937] [P_939] required for [P_942] iv , chlorinated solvent reclamation process .
the handling of the petroleum feedstocks and products [P_98] iii are much [P_913] than the chlorinated solvent feedstocks [P_919] iv .

[P_90] ii operation [P_94] face [P_96] competition because we have [P_912] [P_914] only one dedicated facility that is doing [P_923] similar to what the client [P_929] [P_931] .
this market is expected to grow about 2 % per [P_910] [P_912] [P_914] .

dan larcamp mentioned that he [P_95] electric form 1s [P_910] [P_912] [P_913] .
i 'm not [P_93] 're comparing apples and apples , as the electrics are still [P_916] utilities and thus the form 1 includes sales data .

[P_90] [P_92] commercial , legal and environmental [P_99] [P_911] [P_913] managers [P_915] personnel , enron recommends that the following courses of action [P_927] undertaken : 1 .
assuming that pgl assumes the role of buyer under the terms of the land purchase agreement executed between pgl and air liquide on 4/11/2000 and pgl plans [P_927] to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing , perc and pgl [P_938] immediately [P_940] [P_941] the documents necessary to [P_947] the icc [P_950] of any [P_953] transfer ( sale , lease , or alternative [P_962] ) of the torrence south parcel from pgl to torrence power llc .
this [P_91] based upon the belief that although the torrence south parcel does hold [P_915] to perc and enron as a [P_923] [P_924] site , [P_927] viability and risk / reward [P_934] of the commercial [P_938] has not yet been sufficiently finalized .
[P_90] ( [P_93] with the calumet [P_98] ) represents [P_911] component [P_914] a commercial solution to the mission energy / comed 500 mw " in - city " regulatory obligation to the city of the chicago .
[P_90] contributing to the [P_95] perc and enron not [P_911] [P_913] on 6/26/00 are [P_918] :
the incomplete status of [P_94] commercial [P_97] [P_98] associated with the torrence south parcel .
d. perc and enron 's desire to maintain [P_98] to minimize [P_912] costs while [P_915] [P_916] commercial [P_919] [P_920] associated value proposition prior to executing an icc - approved land transfer from pgl to torrence power llc .
the south parcel represents a [P_95] power [P_97] [P_99] upon which perc and enron [P_916] to conduct due [P_921] [P_923] activities .
perc and [P_92] [P_94] [P_96] risk mitigation strategies including land options , environmental indemnifications , and other [P_919] which protect their respective assets and [P_926] economic viability of a [P_932] on the torrence south parcel .
perc [P_91] personnel have estimated that the icc [P_98] [P_910] require up to 6 months ( the transfer of the calumet parcel was " fast - tracked " and took 3 months to [P_934] icc [P_936] ) .
this risk [P_92] [P_93] viability of an ' 01 in - service date for a torrence power llc [P_919] .

such an agreement shall also specify a formula for the sharing of [P_912] associated with the marketing / selldown strategy currently [P_921] by perc and enron for all of the chicago [P_932] [P_933] .

[P_90] release is ; [P_95] use has [P_99] , and includes automated order processing capacitycenter .
although [P_91] [P_93] the last ease this year , recent market moves [P_913] the fed has done enough to support [P_922] a recovery in h2 .
it turns out that what they really were [P_98] see was something [P_913] a formal biological [P_918] ( ba ) for cs 3 and cs 4 , not a biological survey report [P_934] provided .
he said that only [P_94] were going to [P_99] findings of " [P_914] [P_915] " [P_917] they maybe [P_920] the [P_922] get [P_925] concurrence from the usfws .
mark , i [P_93] to report that [P_98] [P_910] extremely hard to collect all of the information that has [P_922] ( and then some ) for purposes of [P_932] due diligence [P_936] .
while [P_91] [P_93] with awano and seguchi we touched upon [P_912] reaction to our valuation and came upon a fundamental realization .
recognizing that enron [P_93] [P_95] and [P_98] the assumptions we have utilized i still [P_916] share some fundamental [P_921] [P_923] order to put [P_928] into [P_931] .
in other words , [P_94] were to flip [P_99] at [P_912] [P_914] [P_916] at least this much .
looked at [P_92] , discounting the npv back to 2001 at 15 % results in a current npv of $ 558 million , or more than $ 34 per current [P_931] share !
[P_90] [P_92] hard to believe [P_97] [P_99] that [P_912] due diligence [P_915] bear them out .
[P_90] just these two [P_95] placing a ridiculously low 20 % [P_913] [P_915] on them [P_918] the $ 3 per share of cash on our balance sheet gives you nearly $ 20 per share current value .
this is without considering oita or any of the other many [P_911] are [P_914] on .
if enron , with all of its [P_97] resources [P_99] , were to fully support [P_916] [P_917] two [P_920] believe that [P_924] of their [P_928] [P_929] quite high .
( we have been receiving [P_95] support from the [P_99] group by the way )
this is also why i [P_95] that we [P_99] immediate attention [P_913] two [P_916] [P_917] perhaps the oita [P_922] .
i [P_91] [P_93] agree that reaching a conclusion [P_910] [P_912] is in all shareholders interests .
my main concern continues to [P_95] that the current infighting between [P_911] and e power [P_916] enron 's [P_920] recognize 1 ) the quality and [P_928] [P_929] of the employees of e power and 2 ) [P_939] value that has [P_944] through the nearly 2 years of systematic and comparative analysis of all of [P_959] greenfield sites [P_963] as well as [P_968] [P_970] respect to brownfield developments .
within [P_91] six [P_94] [P_96] [P_98] to take off of the market nearly three quarters of the most attractive [P_923] sites [P_925] leaving little for the late comers to the japanese market .
[P_90] to [P_93] [P_95] [P_97] a way [P_911] our mutual energies [P_916] value in [P_920] market rather than on non - [P_928] bickering and turf wars .
[P_90] [P_92] had [P_95] [P_97] the csa [P_911] .
i 'm [P_92] you guys [P_95] the gift .
just to pile on with [P_95] , i [P_99] a [P_912] [P_913] of my own for [P_918] [P_920] [P_922] consider in our november 20 [P_929] .

i had a [P_93] trena mcfarland today picking up on earlier discussions with respect to [P_916] for the softs business to [P_923] out of [P_927] [P_929] ( [P_932] e : [P_936] 2/2/01 [P_939] discussion of the alternatives ) .
trena said that there was a strong legal preference to use ena rather than a [P_915] us corporation for the trading activity conducted out [P_924] [P_926] , and that ectric ( or [P_933] llc ) through eeft [P_938] the principal for uk trading activity .
as a result of this trena is considering [P_98] parallel books such that , for example , the london based traders [P_921] [P_922] prices on nybot [P_926] - alike and the nybot / liffe spread trades as well as offering prices on the liffe [P_944] - alike trades .
the [P_91] [P_93] is that there is the [P_910] of arbitrage since [P_914] [P_916] overlapping hours of trading .
the [P_91] of arbitrage [P_94] restricted to those counterparties which are registered both with [P_915] [P_917] [P_919] and are thus [P_924] see both prices with a bit of collusion - [P_935] [P_937] [P_939] the case of a [P_945] which is operating through one or more branches .

an industry comment period [P_94] global capital rules dubbed " basel 2 " ends on thursday , but [P_919] [P_921] just [P_923] for banks calculating how the sweeping [P_931] [P_933] their businesses .
one reason for the haste is that the basel committee on banking supervision [P_913] [P_915] rules worries an industry stalemate [P_921] adoption of the badly - [P_928] [P_929] rules in [P_932] jurisdictions .
unofficial dialogues [P_92] [P_94] a long while .
banks complain basel 2 's [P_95] formulae , as spelled out in a draft published in january , penalise the irb approach , saying set - asides for risky corporates , for example , [P_934] higher than what is called for by a standardised approach applied for less sophisticated banks .
one fear is that [P_94] lead [P_97] mid - [P_911] banks using the standardised approach to [P_918] with a disproportionately [P_923] exposure to [P_926] borrowers .
supervisors are expected [P_93] out [P_96] , however , and are expected to [P_915] [P_917] data collected by the basel committee under a quantitative [P_927] study ( www.bis.org ) .
but now [P_92] as though [P_96] [P_98] .
the basel committee [P_93] [P_94] analysing these [P_97] , and is [P_912] [P_913] them into the [P_918] version of basel 2 .
some private bankers [P_93] asking banks [P_97] aside [P_910] such risk [P_914] [P_915] the burgeoning business of wealth management which in theory requires a low capital base compared to lending or trading activities .
by kathleen [P_92] dubbed virtual portfolios , risk measurement services that include a ' what - if ' scenario along with the more traditional kind of risk analysis are gaining in importance .
deutsche 's ' what - if positions change ' [P_99] , released [P_912] in mid - [P_917] , includes [P_920] determine [P_923] value at risk ( var ) , [P_932] error and surplus - at - risk resulting from a variety of hypothetical situations .
managers who [P_92] use of the client risk reporting [P_910] [P_911] have a [P_914] [P_915] whether a particular [P_920] [P_922] correlate a fund to an index , for example .
the current var analysis tools have already been mastered by the fund community , which is now [P_917] [P_919] predictors of risk .
var is tied to a particular [P_96] at [P_98] fails to capture [P_913] [P_915] an index , for example , said guillaume blacher , senior managing director , pricing advisory and risk management .
more managers [P_92] [P_94] [P_96] , rather than have a single number that comes out once a day , " she said , referring to the benefits of scenario analysis over traditional risk measurement practices .
the hypothetical scenario tools , along with the traditional var risk measurement systems , [P_914] by fund managers in a complementary way , stated reech capital 's blacher .
hypothetical analysis tools [P_93] [P_94] risk [P_97] deciphering what positions [P_912] to [P_915] within a fund manager 's limit , he added .
the [P_91] [P_93] more reliable scenario hedging [P_99] investing in equity options has been a key driver of demand for ' what - if ' scenario analysis lately .
he also credits the more educated investor [P_97] [P_99] prompting the fund manager to install [P_916] risk management and reporting systems , particularly [P_924] based funds , as fuelling the current demand for hypothetical risk analysis .
however , the current risk measurement systems [P_97] expensive for all but the largest trading organisations , [P_918] for [P_921] - up funds .
the fact that these virtual portfolio hypothetical analysis tools are now [P_911] is beginning [P_914] [P_916] for hedge funds [P_921] up , according to imagine 's cannon .
with the right risk analysis tools , a hedge fund [P_910] up and running in a week , instead of hiring an entire it staff , he said .
the fsa said the [P_94] tank -- which admits it began with negative preconceptions -- ended [P_916] some [P_919] conclusions .
some respondents said they feared that the fsa [P_98] less hospitable to innovation [P_914] - up companies .
while volatility levels dropped in the [P_96] months of the year due to supply and demand [P_917] , the past month has seen volatilities [P_925] [P_926] up again .
[P_90] [P_92] , with the current supply and demand imbalance , that vols [P_914] rise more significantly than they have , " he says .
the fact that vols have not risen in [P_98] creates [P_911] [P_912] those [P_915] use equity derivatives .

one trader [P_92] : " the big [P_98] convertibles believe that the arbitrage funds [P_916] material to the market , although they [P_925] them on a hedge basis [P_932] attractive volatility .
however , he warns : " in this market of convertibles [P_911] to [P_914] aware [P_916] [P_918] get stock off , where [P_925] [P_927] trading and [P_931] [P_933] distribute that credit .
