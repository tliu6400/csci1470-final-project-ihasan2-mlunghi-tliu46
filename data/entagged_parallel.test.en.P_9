good wednesday morning - comments from the local guys !
lehman brothers has established a turn - key plan that take into account the regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan .
please email us or call us for more information .
we believe this new news should be transferred into a higher multiple for the shares immediately .
we are comfortable with 40x on a potential $ 1.00 per share ( we are currently at $ 0.92 ) for fy02 .
we remain cautious on ae 's shares near - term and are lowering our rating to 3 market perform from 2 buy as near - term fundamentals will likely remain weak due to continued order cancellations & pushouts .
we also believe excess channel component inventory will weigh negatively on ae near - term .
are too high and we expect ae to lower near - term expectations when it reports 3q earnings on october 11 .
also , we believe those investors looking for strong back - to - school selling season ( pcs ) will likely be disappointed .
as a result , we think the stock could trade down into the mid-$20s assuming the company needs to lower street ests for the nov qtr , which we are modeling at +5 % q / q rev growth .
we believe guidance could call for revs flat to slightly up q / q .
there has been a lot of good news surrounding diebold 's stock in recent months , including atm ( automated teller machine )
also , new management ( in the past two years ) is focused on international growth and improving margins .
while these factors point to a positive outlook for diebold , we believe the stock price fully reflects the potential .
diebold 's stock has traded primarily in a range of 12 - 20x earnings over the past decade and is currently near the high end of that range .
look for easier comps / lumber comparisons to boost comps in 2h01 .
positive implications of fed 's 300 bp reduction in rates not likely to help fundamentals until 1h02 .
look for new product introductions like xbox and gamecube to help boost comps in 4q. devon energy(dvn )
we will review our earnings & cash flow estimates once we receive guidance from the company .
* celgene has established a valuable franchise in oncology with lead product thalomid , which we think can achieve peak sales of $ 230 million .
the product 's success will ultimately depend on additional clinical data as well as development of new formulations .
we are particularly excited about the prospects for the plant expansion as we firmly believe the new facility could spur the gross margin expansion we have been discussing for some time now .
managers we spoke with conveyed to us a high morale about current business .
growth could come from this new plant .
we are lowering our fy01 and fy02 eps estimates to reflect the revised earnings guidance for fy01 and lower long term growth rate going forward .
the company provided guidance for net credit loss performance in 4q01 and fy02 .
the company noted that it expects the net credit loss rate to be in the 10.45 % -10.75 % range for 4q01 with credit loss rates running at or above that range in fy02 .
we believe the biggest reason for the change in guidance is the lack of success in generating profitable loan growth in the prime & super prime segments and higher than expected credit costs .
key to investment rankings : this is a guide to expected total return ( price performance plus dividend ) relative to the total return of the stock 's local market over the next 12 months .

dynegy also said it raised its earnings estimate for the 2001 year to a range of $ 2.09 to $ 2.10 per diluted share from the $ 2.07 target set on oct. 1 .
i would say the company 's ability to continuously post strong earnings growth illustrates their ability to successfully navigate through wildly various operating environments , " ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said .
but he noted there could be some resolution by the second or third quarter of next year .
the company attributed part of its improved performance this quarter to better results in european and canadian operations , including increased gas marketing in canada .

thanks you guys did a great job ! ! ! !
, we have some good news for you .
we have set up a number which can only be called from enron mobile phones ( 37373 ) , when you dial this number you will hear dialtone .
all calls coming through this route will be recorded and can be retrieved by the telecoms team for playback / reference .
let me know if you want to issue a note as a general announcement or whether you wish to handle the distribution of the number .
cindy , we can provide a telephone number in the office which the traders can call from their mobile phone , they would then be offered dialtone from the telephone system and can then dial on to an external party .
the call would then be routed out from the office and would be subject the the normal recording criteria .
however i would n't recommend this approach as we are opening up an external gateway for people to use our telephone system , this would be unmetered and not secure .
the potential for toll - fraud is something that we need to take into account .
i 'll ask andy cowx ( telecoms manager ) to investigate - my initial thoughts are that technically this may not be possible .
this would help with some of our aa issues .
however , i would make the change effective next tuesday for the balance of the month with cash price stron for the weekend .
bouncing between points ( as capacity at each point allows ) will be permitted as long as the shipper continues to utilize the path purchased .
the transaction is good for the time purchased , if there is a break in the shipper 's use during the transaction , the capcity must be renegotiated , in any event the demand charge will be billed for the full term of the transaction .

if you could redraft the " representations and warranties " provision to be simpler and clearer , i think that we could agree to it .
i think we can legally make these representations and warranties , but the language needs some work .
enron has added a paragraph under " representations and warranties " that i would like you to review .
i would advise getting john't input in case he is more familiar with the reasoning behind this jargon .
i have highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was incorporated ( page 2 of appendix 1 ) .
do you think this is acceptable , or do you think i should show this added paragraph to jon wood ?
if these changes are acceptable please advise and we will forward two original copies for execution .

please understand that my basis for developing an account with paine webber is dependent upon an agressive fee structure .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 4529 .
we will advise you if and when it is definitely triggered .
most of our concern revolves around what may be included within that term ; certainly , it should not include information that we receive from a customer submits to us through the posting agreement , but in any event , a better idea of what the cftc might be concerned about here would be helpful .
i think it would be a good idea to get that in front of our regulatory counsel as soon as possible and ask that they confirm that the no - action letter that you get ( assuming that they give you all the relief that you have requested ) will have everything that they think we need .
we could seek the additional language , but if putting date certain does the same thing without attracting a lot of attention , may be a preferable path .
we may want to get details for inclusion in the discussion with delainey .
can i expect any kind of payback from my contractor for giving him such a high rating ?
tana when you have a chance could you do me a favor and go to www.contractor.com and do a search for contractor by name

> please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else .
thanks -- i now know that you read notes mail messages very promptly ! --sally
nice of you to put weight and size .......
i think that i have a good enough team to withstand a bad start and make it to the playoffs anyway .
this move would maybe help my team the first week , but it would n't help me in the long run .
high please reply please review the attached schedule for the tokenized products .
my current favorite is the omni , which is in one of may favorite locations .

i think we need to get to $ 350 to $ 400/kw firm including idc to make this viable .

thank you gerry gerald b. shebl , professor , electrical and computer engineering director of complex adaptive systems program 1115
bruce , it was good to hear that you will be here a lot in january ( good for me , that is ) .
i realize we are waiting for a legal opinion and assume we will all have further discussions on the issue after new year 's .
upon return after new year 's , akshay and i will look at the items in italics below .
i would also argue that the india obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further dispatch quantities .
i 'm not sure how that will help mseb to recover the full costs of its power purchases .
this helps dpc , this helps mseb and will , in the end , help the country .
customers , and by not giving any new unmetered connections the latter is something that has been decreed by merc ( jane please correct me if i am wrong ) , while the former was the most likely cause for bhave 's exit jane - can you ( with akshaya 's help ) take a crack at what the agricultural load and unmetered customers are likely to be in the years 2002 through 2004 ?
further , we will have to ask the question whether the actual t&d loss is more due to distribution or due to transmission .
we need to do more on that .
this was jim 's concern too when we met this morning , and we will need to develop a plan to move that forward further .
i have merged everyone 's seperate language into one document - this may be easier to work from today , especially for those of you on the phone .
i am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready .
i can make that for you .
we would like to see the position monitor once you get it running .
we might have some additional suggestions .
i can not find it in exotica help file .
describing this model , please tell me what that new input parameter ' sig ' is .

i will look forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team .
we are looking forward to seeing mo next week here in houston .
hi there --- had lunch with mo today -- so as you can imagine she was very interested in my new role , working with you .
i think the management conference is later in the month , so people will generally be around .
please let me know , and i will make sure it happens .
i will also need to spend some time with melissa becker and her team working on post ase reporting solutions , but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with the north america group .
i am ready to get moving on some new things ! ! ! !
gary , does the workhseet mentioned below assist you with the monthly operations related to the industrial customers ?
the industrial " buyback & deficiency deals " worksheet has captured the necessary data to help gas control & the on - call scheduler as well as myself and client services .
i am a little concerned with the long weekend coming up .
i believe that we agreed that these would be set up by the 3rd work day , which would be friday the 7th .
i definitely do n't think that we should any later .
it would be great if this could be handled sooner , miimizing our economic impact .
market operations ' current position is that the market participants have all the information they need to decode oos and oom , such as what has been bid , what has been dispatched , what proxy bids have been created based on available capacity , etc .
in order to fully weigh the ramifications of this decision , i want to solicit examples / scenarios where market participant systems would not be able to correctly settle against a combined oos / oom dispatch through ads .
i would especially like to see comments regarding how must - offer fits in , including issues with proxy bids and whether oom will apply to must offer units .
i am extremely pleased to announce that jo williams has accepted the position as director of the pricing & structuring group !

we are excited to have jo as the director of the pricing & structuring group and invite you to give her a call to congratulate her !

we can all thank clinton for any overdone media coverage on future presidents .
yes , he may have done some good for the country , but he did not do anything to earn the respect he may have gotten , which i hope was little .
clayton , we can discuss your request when i come back to the office on monday .
i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered from the long flight back .
i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my intentions here at enron .
in addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a dynamic matrix facilitating analysis .
it has yet to get back with me on how the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit purposes .
the new machine will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is compaq - specific .
in discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were ubiquitous here .
my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only if enron does well .
i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems .
it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data .
they also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid on a job with your permission .
and , i have already been able to teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i have learned here .
it would be a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol database .
i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their documentation .
i just wanted to say " great job " on the cms implementation on tw .

as i had a little difficulty expressing my concerns today , i thought that i might offer you a little parable .
initially , the two boys could sell about 8 glasses of lemonade each hour between the two of them , but as the weather got hotter they attracted more and more thirsty customers .
it would be expected that the market that is price managed will attract more buyers but less suppliers .
there may be an overlap of responsibilities here where we could help out and consolidate these retail positions .
- can you provide some more detail here .
i am ok with them bidding on load , but i think this is a sign that we should begin consolidating scheduling functions under wholesale
- i think this would be most efficient .
but i wanted to pass this on to you for further consideration :
i think the best way to proceed on this is if we work up example wording for most of the different publication types , and/or verify any wording suggested by jennifer against the original confirm language .
you and your loved ones will be glad you did .
to be removed from any further mailings please visit us here .
i would like to take 12/10 as a vacation day thanks .

i may not have the latest information and perhaps you can update and address when we meet .

two super freshmen and a freshman walk - on kicker even gave some hope for those tough games down the line .
he also has great vision and knows instinctively where to run .
he also has an ability to make most tacklers miss without appearing to do anything to make them miss .
that turned out to be a great decision for the horns because new mexico state fumbled the opening kickoff and the longhorns had a 14 - 0 lead before either team ran a play on the texas end of the field .
recruiting roundup the longhorns still have 12 commitments , but they have a good chance to pick up another one this weekend .
he took an official visit to lsu last weekend and will be at texas this weekend with his parents to participate in the events surrounding the game 's dedication to his brother .
look for a decision next week .
i like texas and will definitely take an official visit to texas later , " he said .
* * dt marco martin of mesquite has a qualifying act score and just needs to make good grades this year to be qualified in core courses , too .
that 's the kind of defense i 'm looking for .
we had some lapses , and we need to work on correcting that .
brown said the longhorns gave up on the run in the first two games last year because of stacked defenses , " and then we could n't run it when we needed to at stanford and we got beat .
we have to be able to run the ball when we want to , regardless of the defensive alignment .
brown said dt maurice gordon played an outstanding game in his first start after moving from a backup de spot .
i 'm going to get those issues worked out
look for ross to be able to clear up the problems and come back in time to go through spring practice next season .
let me know how that sounds to you , and i 'll enter the deals .
a bit lengthy , but i think it looks fine .
jerry would probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each event and may already have something in mind .
depending on mr. skillings availability / interest jerry might want to reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people .
joannie has left the office for the day , but will return tomorrow morning .
do you have any dates for future dinners in mind ?
probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead , that way jerry can brief mr. skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the year and mr. skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend .
should you require any further information .

updated 11/21/01 graham has been quiet recently , but may bust out of a mini - slump against the cardinals .
the loss of tight end mark bruener could have an adverse impact on bettis ' output over the final weeks of the season , but you still need to start him every week in your league .
seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for shaun alexander , and jackson will be a key receiver for matt hasselbeck .
tyrone wheatley has returned from an injury and new york is tough on the run .
only use garner if you do n't have another alternative on your roster .
patten could beat fred thomas downfield for a score , and you should consider using him as your no . 2 or 3 receiver .
there is a possibility mcknight could beat the bills downfield for a few long passes on sunday .
he could be worth using in a deep league since the bills have been weak against the run all season .
he might make a good no . 3 receiver for this week .
11/21/01 richardson has fallen into a goal - line back role in recent games , and there 's a chance he 'll get a score against the seahawks on sunday .
kansas city should move the ball with relative ease , and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown - only league , he might be worth putting in your lineup .

paul goddard has asked me to speak with you about letters of consent that may or may not be needed for newsticker items .
i think this could be ( unfortunately for your team 's workload ) an increasingly important area as we move forward with developing content ( news and other ) .

i am sorry for the lateness of the draft , but these are not extensive comments .

: i do n't know if you 've talked with cindy in the past few days - but , if it 's okay with you , i 'd like to decline your very sweet offer of having a baby shower .
here 's the deal : a couple of friends had already offered to do one - and i 'm having trouble coming up with a vibrant mix of people to split amongst two showers .
this seems to be a good decision for cindy , too , since may be a bit short of cash and energy right now .
however , i would love for you to come to the one shower - if it 's convenient for you .
i would love for you to meet my friends , and for them to meet you !
if it does n't work for you , i 'll certainly understand - especially since you may want to come again when baby is born .
but , if you 'd like to consider coming , i 'd like to know your schedule .
i think going any later than this might be cutting it close !
what i need from you is to know which of these weekends you might be available .
what i expect is that you and pam will work together to come up with an efficient solution .
it was also brought to my attention that you want to minimize the time you spend on this process , i would agree with that .
so i would expect to see this process finely tuned in very near future .
i appreciate your concern in this matter , and i fully agree that its imperative for me to enter deals accurately .
i have talked to pam about this and i wanted to keep you in the loop .

after the last break - in , you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time .
is there any chance that stan ( pge ) may be allocated any charges this quarter for the tomas transaction that ran through the pgg books last year .
it would seem like if we were trying to make the transmission and distribution business numbers look good this quarter we would want to avoid making that charge .
louise : i am happy to provide you with the short form gtc today .
however , i believe that an on - line eei will receive quicker market acceptance than the gtcs and that as a result more counterparties will start trading on - line in a shorter period of time .

please provide short form gtc today - thanks .
in order to grant you access i will need to get your nt login id and your e - mail address .

to prepare for el paso energy 's looming takeover of coastal corp. , westcoast energy inc. and coastal are splitting up engage energy , their three - year - old marketing venture , with each retaining a half interest in the houston - based gas marketer .
the split should be completed by the end of the week .
coastal , headquartered in houston , will merge with el paso energy in a $ 16 billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter ( see daily gpi , jan. 19 ) , and company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed before the merger could be finalized , including dismantling the engage venture .
engage estimates it will add another 1 bcf / d to its natural gas deliverability by the end of this year .
there is expected to be little impact on either company 's existing asset valuation .
by taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and trading functions , we can better capitalize on the knowledge , experience , track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three years , " said michael phelps , westcoast ceo .
when coastal merges with el paso , it will be joining a company that already has a strong gas marketing arm .

it follows on an open season announced in late june for 400 - 500 mmcf / d of firm transportation capacity on a bi - directional lateral it plans to add to its system within california .
that open season ended tuesday , but a spokesperson said it was too soon to publish results .

as members of congress from the northwest , we are particularly interested in , and have been following closely , the development of rto west .
we would also oppose the ferc setting standardized national rules for rtos on issues like pricing and congestion management .
the northwest needs the flexibility to do what is best for our region given the unique characteristics of our grid .
finally , we would respectfully request that the ferc mandate independent , cost - benefit analyses for each rto .
while the theoretical benefits of an rto ( like increased reliability and efficiency ) may ultimately exist , those benefits may be outweighed by increased costs to consumers for generation or transmission service .
we are pleased that rto west has commissioned an independent cost - benefit analysis , but it is still unclear whether the scope of the report will be satisfactory .
thank you , in advance , for your careful consideration of our concerns .
we would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you to discuss these issues further and look forward to working with you to ensure a well - functioning wholesale market that does n't adversely impact consumers .

as can be seen below , lehman is adjusting the earnings estimates for the s&p 500 in the wake of events on september 11th .
we believe that this event , as well as the potential for additional senior management departures , increases execution risk significantly for charter .
we believe bk should be one of the companies most leveraged and best positioned to an improvement in the economic and market environments because we believe that improvement will be preceded by stronger market volumes and greater capital market activity .
although we expect swy to beat its 1.0 % guidance , it probably will not be by much .
we have been culling through our comprehensive list of publicly traded communications technology companies looking for attractive investment opportunities .
at a closer look , the data tells a somewhat different story given that the huge inventory increase was driven largely by very high import levels , specifically , 1 million barrels per day ( mmbls / d ) over the past week , which in our opinion is unsustainable .
thus , while the increase in gasoline inventories was substantially larger than expected , we think it is premature to draw any negative conclusion .
q fmer notched up a better than expected second quarter performance and we have a high level of confidence in our full year estimates .
although we do n't expect a large margin boost we would not be surprised by a modest improvement on the order of 10 bps which would be fmer 's 4th consecutive qtr of margin gains .
organic loan growth should run in the high single digit range , which may be blunted by residential loan sales like last quarter .
we expect the quarter to evidence continued net interest margin expansion and further improvement at metavante .
q sluggish loan growth could restrain further improvement .
however , the stock could come under pressure as others trim their guidance for ' 02 .
stock could reflect eps uncertainty for a while q rockwell guides 4q eps in a $ 0.05-$0.07 range , and 2001 eps to $ 0.91-$0.93 due to downturn in global industrial automation market .
we are pleased to announce that we have rescheduled the store tour for monday , november 19 , 2001 , at 11 am ( preceding lowe 's analyst meeting ) , lehman brothers will sponsor a trip for institutional investors to visit the newly opened " radioshack cool things " store - within - a - store inside a blockbuster store .
our prior $ $ 38 m ebitda estimate is within the company 's pre - released $ 36-$39 m range , demonstrating the company 's cash management skills .
i 'm hoping you 'll enjoy the application .
could you please provide a detailed analysis of the following two accounts : 52501000 20017000 2 .
the answers to these questions may be as simple as providing e - schedules , or there may be more detail needed .
if you could have this information to me by november 15 , i would greatly appreciate it .
if you have any questions or issues with this request , please call me at extension 53522 .
if you have any questions , please > contact your transportation specialist .
let me know if you need more information !

based on williams ' closing price on may 4 , 2001 , the stock portion of the transaction is valued at $ 73.63 per share .
already this business model has paid off nicely for williams , which reported $ 912.4 million in marketing and trading revenue for year - end 2000 , more than doubling revenue from 1999 .
williams has a similar project in florida , where it has partnered with duke energy to jointly purchase the coastal corporation 's 100-percent interest in the gulfstream natural gas system project .
as a side note , shell 's loss of barrett must be particularly painful for the international oil titan as it is the second failed acquisition that the company has experienced within the past few weeks .

, i am attaching below a small draft note prepared by anshuman on lng hedging .
it could provide risk mitigation in the high price scenario , while allowing some participation in low prices .
as we bounce these ideas , i think it is very important that we work closely with the global markets group .
the team on the ground knows the contracts better , and maybe able to give you insights on what can be sold to mseb .
would love to discuss the same with you .
thanks for all of your e - mail responses for round ii of registration !
we will review your requests over the next few weeks and will confirm your spring 2001 schedules on december 8 ( please see my oct. 27 memo on registering for classes ) .
may i please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business wednesday .
we hope to have agreed on the q&a 's by then and to send it out the announcement on thursday .
we see significant opportunities in each of these businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in japan in order to capture these opportunities .
however , while japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market , significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure .
until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in japan , we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses .
we are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our resources with the opportunities in the japanese market .
joe hirl our president of enron japan will move to the global markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our global markets opportunities in japan especially weather , oil , lng , coal , and shipping .
we expect to continue our general recruiting of japanese nationals and as president of enron japan , joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the analyst and associate program in japan .
we are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and encom will continue to report to the enron europe office of the chairman .
by may we expect enron credit to have two to three employees in tokyo pursing the credit derivative business .
in the last seven months the commercial support services for japan have been transitioned to london for support and this is not changing .
we anticipate that his team 's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the encom power plant development team but they will also continue to provide support for global markets , ebs & industrial markets .
we have already made considerable progress in breaking into the japanese markets across a wide range of enron businesses and we anticipate that this will provide significant profit growth for years to come .
through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company .
i will strive for a seamless transition if need be .

press conference greetings : iep will be holding a press conference on tuesday november 28 at 10:30 a.m. in the governors press room to discuss the importance of long - term fixed ( that term is easier to understand than bilateral ) contracts .

we would like as many iep participants as possible at the conference to show that there are several companies who continue to be serious about long - term fixed price contracts .
we have already received a couple of responses and if you are interested please let me know

could you please forward them to him as soon as possible so that he can sign off on the terms and we can still forward the drafts to the bank by some time this afternoon ?
good luck with the new guys .
i agree with your comments on the business model for lawyers .
dan fournier asked me to go to lunch so he could update me on his " very positive meeting " with jim and you .
i hope that is ok with you .
i also know that there is a philosophy in houston to commercial people not having say in legal retainers , but i believe that the senior commercial people who are responsible for the transactions , particularly in a smaller office in a smaller market , have an important place in the relationship , and in that regard , i know fournier has lost the trust and confidence of rob milnthorp .
regarding donahue ernst and young , it should be borne in mind that the initial contact to doing work at their firm was through jordan mintz and morris clark on the tax side .
i also think that jim needs to understand that the business model is likely not going away , and likely to expand in canada , the us and europe and is something we likely can not ignore .
also , the circumstances you will recall for us using dey initially was on regulatory and contracting issues affecting the retail market , where the incumbent firms with any experience in the area were all conflicted and in an area where blakes is particularly weak in calgary .
frankly , dey has done good work for us .

: i heard from robert michaels that citizens for a sound economy ( cse ) may be interested in sponsoring his study .
wayne brough at cse plans to approach epsa and others to gauge interest .
malloy does not want to fund raise for his part , however , so cse might be responsible for both if it gets done .
i do n't know if we need to do this study and the work that seabron and lecg would be doing .
i think that we need to make sure that we have the right questions to ask .
i think robert would do a good job but raise these issues : 1 ) this is expensive .
his naruc connections are very important , and we would want him on the popularization side , but this is too much .
the study might need a co - author with lots of academic credibility to join robert as good as he is .
i 'm glad that we have this proposal -- it will force us to think about what we want , who does it , and how it should be distributed .
we should also think about how much industry money we could gather to fund such an effort ( it should be large given the stakes ) .
can you provide your impressions so i can get back to robert ?
gimme a call as soon as is reasonably possible .
thank you -- we will probably get back to don sometime tomorrow .
thanks ben ( see attached file :

my understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the intent of diverting resources from the grms project to some other project .
while i am not privy to the urgency of this other project , i do know that we have a very large , multi -phase project going in grms .

i think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted .

eia plans to begin reporting natural gas storage data on a weekly instead of monthly basis beginning in may 2002 .
the puc staff has been grappling with whether to create a mechanism that would ensure a minimum reserve margin or whether margins should be left to market forces .
the institute of supply management , formerly the national association of purchasing management , said the manufacturing sector may turn around faster than previously anticipated , giving hope that demand for natural gas and electricity will improve later this year .
the federal energy regulatory commission said it 's ready to designate an organization or develop the standards itself .

new york -(dow jones)- banks should be prepared to tighten the coordination between credit risks they are exposed to in different markets , as they adapt to the changing requirements of the basel accord on capital requirements , a federal reserve study says .
specifically , the report cites exposure to derivatives as one area where broader and more tightly integrated models of credit risk are likely to be a future requirement for banks .
the new york federal reserve study , entitled " using credit risk models for regulatory capital : issues and options , " is for future publication in a forthcoming economic policy review .
when questioned , hirtle said the study 's reference to derivatives and to the possible need for some banks to tighten correlations among different instruments of credit risk going forward was n't based on specific events or problems in the financial sector .
for positions that involve derivatives or that otherwise depend to a material extent on market factors , standards likely would require integrated models of market movements and credit exposures , " the report said .
she also gave an example in general terms of how a chain of events might lower the worth of a credit for a bank .
the coming revisions to the basel accord , planned for introduction by 2004 , aim to update the way that banks globally account for risk .
nobuaki kurisu , chief fund manager at sumisei global investment trust management , also cited derivatives -related selling as a factor in the stock market 's plunge , and added that such selling should keep market volatility high for the time being , making institutional investors hesitant to buy .
the rush to hedge equity linked derivative bonds , which usually mature in six months to one year , offer higher interest rates than ordinary bonds if the nikkei stays above a pre - determined level .
but once the nikkei drops below that level , the return at the bond 's maturity will be lower than the initial investment .
it is designed to serve as a kind of calculation device to determine who can file under chapter 13 and who can file under chapter 7 .
the bill now must wait until the senate passes its version before a conference can be appointed to work out differences between the two bills ( see related report in this section ) .
bonds that had previously been trading at a 60 handle could suddenly be tendered at par .
important insurance credit default swaps stipulate that in one of several possible events - the declaration of a bankruptcy ; the failure to pay interest on a loan or bond , or the restructuring , repudiation or acceleration of a loan that lowers the overall creditworthiness of a counterparty - the buyer of the swap may deliver to the seller any loan or bond extending out to a predefined maturity , and receive back par value in return .
nobody wants to throw a company into bankruptcy if there 's a glimmer of hope that a company may turn around with time .
since the loan was renegotiated on the last day of the contract , bofa certainly could have considered it a repaid loan , and then extended a new loan if it had wanted to couch it in such terms , " says one dealer .
that path would have avoided the technical default .
the credit derivatives market has effectively bifurcated itself into two distinctly different products , and although it has n't yet reached a critical stage , participants are concerned that this bifurcation may start to hurt overall market liquidity .
for example , would a bank give up its collection rights on a $ 20 million credit default swap if it had $ 1 billion in total loans that could be thrown into the nonperforming category by a bankruptcy declaration ?
the conseco situation showed how a technical default could trigger a credit derivatives exercise , but without the debt of the underlying company being truly hurt .
we have to establish a better standard for interdealer business , or risk less liquidity and a great deal of added basis risk within dealer books .
although achieving consensus will not be easy , kennaugh 's hope is that some standard acceptable to investors , hedgers and dealers alike can be established .
the language to accomplish this might require some tricky drafting , but the goal would be to give sellers of credit derivatives more solace that they could not be blindsided on a loan restructuring with the delivery of longer - dated paper , while the buyers of credit default swaps would still maintain the regulatory ability to tender restructured paper .
this compromise , however , could create a " two - step delivery option .
on the occasion of a loan restructuring , the holder of a credit default swap might be able to either tender the actual loan affected or a similar short - term piece of debt , or hold onto the credit derivative for the possibility of an actual bankruptcy event at a later date .
in other words , there could be one central contract , but with a new delivery twist within it .
it might introduce too much uncertainty into the delivery process .
given the large range of potential underlying credits , however , the specific drafting required here might be even more difficult for participants to agree on in advance .
such an approach might result in more documentation mismatches and basis risk on dealer books , but it might also keep diverse end - user participants more satisfied .
people will trade what contracts they want to trade , and we may have to wait to see which contract that will be .
if banks still want relief with restructuring included , that price exists today and will continue to exist .
it 's easy to imagine yet another situation where xerox may technically fall into default on certain obligations , but continue to pay interest on other paper .
lawsuits have n't sprung from the conseco situation , but they could for xerox since there is more money on the table .
if more credit problems flare up soon , isda documentation will likely come under even more scrutiny , with conseco simply having been the first warning shot across the bow of the credit derivatives market .
it has been approved by ben and chris booth and should be presented to sandridge for approval today .
i left mary gosnell a message making sure that she was of what we are doing and that she needed to provide you with any additional new counterparties that we have done trades with since last weeks list was compiled .

thanks to my work i had the opportunity to meet glenn prickett , executive director of the center for environmental leadership in business at conservation international who advised me to contact susan worthen at enron .
if possible , could you send me some information on enron 's development in carbon markets and in general on the enron 's experience in emissions trading ? .
however , i will be glad to debate the point of whether inflation will be a problem for the foreseeable future .

this format was developed with the help of outside counsel and the tax group .
some time later fede and others in the commercial team came up with two other suggestions that they felt enron could use to avoid the gross receipts tax problem .
the commercial team suggested that enron could specify in our invoices that we are billing for the producers and therefore not include the amounts invoiced in our gross receipts .
once it was clear that the first example was not going to provide the help we were looking for , the commercial team proposed a " tax avoidance " scheme used by one of the small gas marketers .
further , we were advised that if enron tried a similar strategy enron and its management would likely incur significant tax and legal liabilities .
i worked with outside counsel to review the structure but they ultimately advised us that the structure , as outlined , would not likely withstand a challenge by any tax court since the difference between what we wanted and a marketing agreement was simply a matter of form over substance .
as we could not come up with a workable alternative that would be commercially acceptable to all parties we stopped working on the document several months ago .
i left the issue on my " to do " list for several months to see if i could come up with another alternative which i have not been able to do .
please let me know if you want to discuss this further or if you have other suggestions for me to look at .
please come prepared to discuss key issues in your rto / region .
this request has been pending your approval for 30 days .

through this site we will initially offer a one- and two - year fixed - price gas product to small and medium - sized businesses behind four utilities in ohio and illinois .
second , to understand the technical and business process challenges we will face in offering these products on a larger scale through the web .
we wanted to achieve both these objectives in a low profile manner .
first , we concluded that we needed to add a price comparison feature to the site .
this proved more difficult than expected and still requires improvement .
second , we experienced technical problems with the stability of the underlying database application that required a fair amount of time to resolve .
first , the design and technical performance of the existing site will be continuously improved over the next weeks and months .
we will add the capability to sell power products in a limited number of states in the next 8 weeks or so .
in parallel , we have engaged mckinsey & co. to help with a 4 - 6 week mid - market strategy development effort that will help define the specific products , target customers , and sales channels necessary to pursue the mid - market in an aggressive way .
out of this effort will also come some high - level requirements for a technology and business process platform that is scaleable and flexible enough to support a large number of transactions and a broad array of products .
this second generation platform will take advantage of the learning that occurs throughout the pilot period and will integrate with our mid - office billing and customer service systems .
we will also try to leverage as much as possible from the success of enrononline .
a complete post - development assessment is underway and will be completed within about two weeks .
finally , i 'd like to recognize the hard work of the team members that contributed to the development version 1.0 of the site .
chris mccaig - priya jaisinghani - malcolm adkins - jeff stephens - tracy adams - diann huddleson i will continue to provide updates as we progress .
if you have any questions please call me at 3 - 6091 .
thanks for all your hard work in completing the iteration ! !

but there are pitfalls along that path as well , raising new questions about when the bonds will be sold .
john hallacy , managing director for municipal bond research at merrill lynch & associates , said the bond market is still expecting the sale , but he 's concerned that details on marketing of the bonds have n't been released .
if the state can not sell its proposed revenue bond as planned in a timely manner , the potential effect on the state 's general fund could be severe without large further retail rate hikes beyond the sizable percentage increases recently implemented , " s&p said .
the authorization for the bonds , however , depends on a complicated calculation of the cpa , which determines the funds available for debt service and , ultimately , the size of the issue .
the utility has since filed for bankruptcy protection , raising further doubt about the state 's ability to tap the utility 's revenue for its own purposes .
the state has set a rough target of june for the bond sale to go forward , although some have said it could be delayed until july or august .
hallacy , of merrill lynch , said the bond market " could deal " if the sale was conducted after june 30 , because it will give it more time to prepare for the sale .

the tax could very well result in the departure of these companies from the city .
in addition to stifling the growth of such businesses , such a tax would also hinder the state 's and jersey city 's ability to compete for various other enterprises that are presently considering relocations to the city .

the major factor is the use of one - shot revenues and new laws , adopted to assist the city , which permitted bulk lien sales and accelerated tax sales .

i have a few things to hand off that i had started working on , and i was going to be the first point of pr contact from brindle 's group in the event of the crisis line is set in motion .
sorry for the delay in responding .
i think these should be booked directly with rmt .
according to sources close to senior pg&e officials , pg&e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the california government 's willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now .
while a deal can still be done , anything like the $ 10 billion pg&e wants would be very hard to get through the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase . ?
thus , in a very short time period , pg&e 's corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis .
two other appointments to the commission will soon be named , this official notes , and one of them " could easily become chairman .
i have sent to mary and tana the issues that need to be resolved on these 2 amendments .
they are minor but need a lawyer 's attention and mary will coordinate with luke m. and suzi on this .
he is looking into what issues need to be reviewed / discussed .
if that is the case can we send executed copy 's of the isda to him for signature .
before it is sent off , we need to make sure the correct changes have been made to the credit annex , as the credit support provider has changed from my original credit worksheet .
i have given a copy of the guaranty to tana , can you please review this and provide your comments to suzzi .
thank you , russell carol st clair 08/04/2000
the comments that i made to the other engage guaranty which i have forwarded to you should apply here .
the latest draft of the engage us amendment and the latest draft of the engage canada amendment i believe is still on your system and should be in the file , but you and mary should both follow up with their attorney based on the e - mails that i sent to him which i have forwarded to you .
hope you and you newborn are doing well ?
i am not sure what work issues you are handling , if any , but i would like to ask you if you have any further information on engage .
also , i would like to know what outstanding issues we have with the engage us and canada isda amendments
so i can go ahead and work to finish them up .

the meeting has been called at the initiative of dabhol power to update its lenders on the current situation of the project .
dpc said in the agreements , the maharashtra government had pledged to " support and encourage the further development and completion of the dabhol project .
the meeting will be in london and will be attended by international as well as local lenders of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , he added .
azurix hopes to attract foreign bidders for wessex , which could act as a launch pad for limited consolidation in the west and south west of england , where three small water - only companies operate .
since the smelters would not be able to operate economically at such prices , either suggestion in effect means that the smelters will be out of business for two and a half years .
as the power crisis has tightened , the terms proposed by the bpa for the smelters ' new five - year contracts have got steadily worse .
golden northwest , which has two smelters in the area , recently agreed a dollars 1.6 m deal with the bpa under which the agency would build and operate a new gas - fired turbine plant .
assuming that enough additional energy capacity is built , west coast power prices could ease in a couple of years .
in the short term , the reduction in us aluminium output - it is now about 30 per cent lower than at the start of 2000 - will merely balance the expected cuts in demand , and prevent the market swinging into surplus .
a supply glut , especially on long distance routes between large cities , is dragging down prices and investment on new capacity has slowed considerably as demand flags .
what is needed , according to san francisco - based online exchange ratexchange corp. , is a standardized contract that would provide the framework for commodity - like trading .
without such agreement , buyers and sellers of bandwidth need to agree on new terms for each transaction , said michael rose , ratexchange 's director of business development .
and as new players enter the market , like global crossing ltd. and energy companies dominion resources and dynegy inc. , competition has heated up .

tennessee valley authority is preparing to locate its first new power plant in a generation .
but unlike the massive and controversial nuclear plants tva proposed in the 1960s , the newest power generating facility will be much smaller and less controversial than any plant tva has erected in the past half century .
the new plant would be the first that tva has ever built not on a river or lake .
we would hope that tva will try to use these type of plants to replace some of the dirtier coal plants , which are major sources of air pollution in the valley .
but we 've found that in the crunch times in the summer it is good to have your own power source .
but because the new plant is located in a rural area and will generate only between 12 and 30 permanent jobs , it has not attracted much public comment yet , mr. carter said .
the environmental review is expected to be completed this summer and the plant should be in operation by june 2001 .

it is unclear whether or not the bill will be voted on tomorrow or held until monday , but there will be a hearing at 2:00 p.m. sbx 1 will probably be heard tomorrow as well , although it is not clear what action if any the senate energy committee will take .
our initial focus has been on the trouble with getting air credits .
he talked bill through further layers of disposal dismantling , but still we could n't reach rudy .
i resisted the suggestion , but the dispatcher was adamant : " they 'll help you out , " he said .
the cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be quite nice .
( the unusual circumstances helped us get quickly on a first - name basis with our cops . )
if we could just get the sink out and lay it on its side , i 'll bet we could slip him out .
that sounded like a good idea at this point , anything would have sounded like a good idea and as it turned out , officer mike runs a plumbing business on weekends ; he knew how to take out the sink !
the remaining three of us decided that getting rudy sedated was a good idea , but bill and i were new to the area .
at about 3 am , the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was good for a full recovery .
just in time to hear the good news , officer tom rushed in , finished with his real police work and concerned about rudy .
i wanted to thank officers tom and mike by giving them gift certificates to the local hardware store , but was told that they could n't accept gifts , that i would put them in a bad position if i tried .
so i wrote a letter to the police chief praising their good deeds and sent individual thank - you notes to tom and mike , complete with pictures of rudy , so they could see what he looks like with his head on .
i have made a few notes for you to consider and a couple of editorial changes .
i think the information is useful and well presented .
the award will be presented by the lester center for entrepreneurship &
i look forward to furthering our working relationship in that environment .

the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients .
to gauge the response of the model to wildly - varying rpi forward curve , a sine wave of period 3 years for rpi was input into the ppi model .
this shows that if we had more detail in our rpi forward curve , then the ppi model would reflect those peaks and humps adequately .
the new model is plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue .
dear all , we thought it might be useful to incorporate brent crude as an explanatory variable for ppi ; it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long - term average of $ 18.80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is used ) .
as you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term predictions of 3.0 % to 3.2 % over the next six months .
this is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009 ( which we do n't ) .
what could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to forecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive error terms .
this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we could include this information onto the front of this long - term model .
hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ; your ideas on this would be appreciated .
davis hopes to rework power deals : the long - term energy pacts are having a big impact on the state 's budget .
the developments reflect a new dilemma : the state 's strategy of negotiating long - term contracts helped end the electricity crisis but sparked a new set of financial problems that could affect the state for the next decade .
i do n't think you should expect some kind of wholesale effort on all these contracts .
but we would be willing to consider renegotiation if it was mutually beneficial .
mark , do you want me to assist on this

it started when a three - day heat wave , from may 21 to may 24 , set records in some areas of the state and drove up the demand for electricity as californians sought relief with air conditioning .
it was the first time the generators had an opportunity to see how high the price could go , " said ucan 's michael shames .
but the provision also has the potential to funnel billions of dollars to energy suppliers at a time when those payments are the subject of intense negotiation .

it reads like a phone book : able auto body , able building maintenance , able fence co. , able printing , able termite & pest control . . . . ? ?
it provides a glimpse into the relationships between a giant utility -- the state 's largest -- and businesses of all sorts and sizes .
a key state senator , worried about the slowing economy , is looking for places to pare as much as $ 4 billion from gov. gray davis ' proposed $ 104.7-billion budget .
without a larger reserve heading into 2002 , peace said , the slowing economy could force the state to make deep cuts or raise taxes next year , at a time when most legislators and davis will be running for reelection . ? ?
davis , however , has an immediate need for money .
the state constitution says the budget must be in place by the july 1 start of the new fiscal year .
if you look at what happened , the net of it was a loss , " mr. glynn said , " because the value leaked out on the regulated utility side faster than we were able to build it on the nonregulated side .
turn has been keeping tabs on companies like pacific gas and electric co. and pacific bell for more than 25 years .
frankly , i would have expected myself to be on the same page with ( turn ) more than i actually am , " wood said .
even though scores of new power plants have been built in the northeast , south and midwest in recent months and many more are on the drawing boards , the expected 15 percent increase in new generation will not be fully on - line for another two years .
he said that even if half of those announced plants never materialize , this year 's new capacity is certain to be as great or greater than last year 's , meaning that the predicted increased consumption can probably be met .
outside the west , the greatest potential for blackouts may be in new york , where the near certainty of transmission logjams in an antiquated infrastructure prompted consolidated edison co. to request approval for 11 combustion turbine mini - generators in case of a power shortage .
stephen allen , spokesman for the northeast power coordinating council said , " if the 400 megawatts the generators provide go on - line , it 'll still be tight , but new york should be okay .
he said upstate new york should have surplus electricity to sell to new york city , although some experts say transmission bottlenecks could make it difficult for new york city to import power on abnormally hot days . ? ? ?
allen said that since last june , new england has added mostly gas - fired plants that generate more than 1,000 megawatts and should have an additional 2,000 megawatts on - line before the end of the summer .
few power grids are in as good shape as texas 's .
when it looked like california power customers would be able to get electricity from whoever offered it at the cheapest price , utilities worried about recovering the money they 'd spent building plants and transmission lines in the ' 70s and early ' 80s .
but i 'm really worried about this summer , " she said last week , referring to the potential for day after day of rolling blackouts .
davis may abhor giving out bad news , but freeman need not shrink from it .
as californians bear a disproportionately higher tax burden , they stand to benefit greatly from the president 's tax relief plan .
though he has proposed cuts in some programs that are important to california , bush has taken some actions that please state officials .
he has proposed a permanent research and development tax credit -- an action that would particularly benefit silicon valley . ? ?
stocks rise on good news : the gdp report boosted stock prices , which already had gotten a lift from better - than - expected home sales figures earlier in the week .
the move could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the state 's borrowing costs , bond experts said .
general dynamics executives said they are confident of receiving the necessary approvals because this time they will be dealing with the bush administration , which may view the takeover differently .
disney also confirmed that it will shrink its venerable animation unit , with a union official estimating as many as 300 jobs of about 1,000 in burbank could be cut .
separately , president robert iger confirmed that layoffs will be needed to reach disney 's previously announced goal of cutting 4,000 jobs companywide .
please see monday 's business section for a preview of the week 's events .
on wednesday , the commission apparently decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in place on the california electricity market .
i say " apparently " because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all .
diesel plants spark concern they 're expected to generate big air - quality problems when predicted summer blackouts hit .
some are relatively clean , particularly if they have been built or retrofitted in the last few years .
we would like some kind of statewide policy on when and where we can use the diesel generators , " said gino dicaro , a spokesman for the california manufacturers and technology association .
obviously , we would like to use them more than we can now .
nonetheless , the california energy commission has been compiling a list of generators statewide to see how their use could be coordinated , a move that stirs hope from business groups . ? ?
the next two months could be critical , because most new power plants under construction wo n't go on line before july .
in turn , the south coast air quality management district extended the number of hours that diesel generators could be operated each year .
in the bay area , regulators are even more uncertain of what could happen this summer .
edison has n't been shy about going to sacramento for favors ; last year , for example , edison wanted some changes made in the operation of the state 's power grid .
if democratic leaders fear that voters will be in a throw - the - bums - out mood next year , they may throttle back on intentions to maximize their party strength in drawing new legislative districts .
these are but a few of the potential effects that california will experience long after the immediate crisis has faded , whenever that may be . ? ?
the energy crisis is good for you source :
for decades , we burned lights whenever we wanted , bought more and more energy - guzzling appliances , bigger and bigger television sets .
" we talk about having to hit mules over the head with a 2 by 4 to get their attention , but i do n't think human beings are much more responsive or foresighted .
nowhere has the ethic of unlimited consumption been more out of control than in the bay area , where the energy demands of high tech outstripped what the electricity grid could supply .
perhaps the 34 days of blackouts some experts predict for this summer will bring the discipline that eludes us .
tougher efficiency standards have helped , but so has our great weather .
california has a uniquely good climate to be efficient , " says dan kammen , director of the renewable and appropriate energy laboratory at the university of california at berkeley .
but if we handle it right , all kinds of positive energy will result .
by exposing those who got us into this predicament -- producers , utilities , regulators and politicians -- there 's a chance we 'll get out of it with a more rational and efficient energy grid and be better prepared to deal with challenges down the road .
we want instant , abundant power -- but we do n't want any new power plants , especially in our backyards .
but today 's crisis could lead to permanent changes in behavior , if only because the technology needed to harness sun , wind and other renewable energy sources has become far more cost effective than a generation ago .
this difficult moment in california 's history has already yielded some ecological epiphanies , like those experienced by ernest callenbach 's neighbors .
the magical moment is the idea that by having a photovoltaic cell on your roof , you can make your electric meter run backward , " said callenbach .
could also cause more blackouts this summer .
from the shipwreck of california 's electric industry , albert vera sees a chance to build a life raft . ? ?
since january , the cities of hercules in the bay area and corona in southern california have formed utilities to deliver electric service to new neighborhoods - a strategy that sidesteps potential condemnation fights with the existing utility .

there was some misinformation communicated to them about eol , and i told them the only way we would trade online with them was under the existing master , not under the online gtcs , we wanted the bankruptcy protection the master affords .
they want to replace the old erms master with an isda and i told them we would be happy to generate the master .
can i get some credit from you
so i can turn around a master quickly , or we will have to work off their form , which will then become an isda comparison which will be a lot more work in the long run .
much thanks as usual for your prompt help !

dte to look at interstate special access services new york -- psc releases verizon service - quality report new jersey --
the commission determined that it would use the fcc 's forward- looking cost model to calculate acs - an 's interim une rate . acs-
an ran the fcc model and its own version 7.2 model to compute its forward - looking costs .
gci said it ran the fcc model using anchorage customer and wire center information with the inputs from the juneau - fairbanks arbitration and produced a $ 14.92 loop rate .
the spokesperson added that lakefield residents and city officials were likely to express their support for legislation that would make it easier for area residents to receive broadband services .
the condition also would direct the parent company to provide " sufficient resources " to the operating companies to provide safe and reliable service .
the commission pointed out that considerable public benefit would be realized if the sale was consummated .
may not give a very useful or detailed picture of verizon 's provisioning process .
the public service commission has released a service - quality report for verizon new york , inc. , that details service - quality trends for second quarter 2001 and measures the company 's adherence to its performance plans .
one of the working groups will be headed by dennis bone , president - verizon new jersey , and will review telecom security issues , review the disaster efforts on sept. 11 , and work on establishing security protocols based on what worked well and could be improved or modified , a spokesperson for mr. bone told tr .
this will help telecom carriers to work with each other , with other utilities , and with state government to respond to such situations , the spokesperson said .
organizations and clusters representing arizona 's technology community have sponsored a survey to determine the community 's most important issues and then advocate for them .
the association added that this year they have been offered an " unprecedented " opportunity by house commerce and economic development committee chairwoman barbara leff ( r. , district 24 ) ) , who asked the industry for input on how the state can support technology industries .
the company is planning to expand into 20 more cities , a spokesman told tr .
three units were purchased with a grant from the verizon foundation for use in the state .
as to the term of the work , i suggested a 3-mo period ( i have yet not talked to international office which arranges work authorization using curricular practical training of which i have used up 9 months already ) , i might run into problems if i ask for more .
i also mentioned that i would do my best to accomodate your preferences .
i shall call you tomorrow to discuss the details .

taylor has been practicing the past three weeks and the jaguars had hoped he would have been back in the lineup already .
he was n't sure specifically how much time fred would miss
it 's going to be very unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in the immediate future , " said rosenhaus .
the jaguars have done a very good job in working him
when the jaguars talk to him later today , i 'm sure they 'll have the same feeling .

i guess that could be our back up plan going forward until we have time to determine the best way to handle this .
it seems to be still something of a work in progress but has some good functionality that it delivers today .
unfortunately it will require some rework to make it work after the sale closes .
since we have spent money on a contractor to develop the application i 'm hesitant to just give it away and have you load it directly on an aep pc without some type of reimbursement for the development costs .
we could redesign the interfaces to be more of scheduled push from enron but we 'd want to be reimbursed for this cost .
how would you like to move forward on this ?
please look into planning this trip .

hi group , i emailed lari ( who confirmed that we are on the reservation list , without credit card numbers or deposit because she knows us ... ) that we think we 'll have five for an all - day ride on sat .
jeff , we hope you can make it .
please give your vote , which of these would you be interested in ( or if you have another suggestion , please feel free to offer it -- i 'm overwhelmed with the many other choices and have no personal experience with any to rely on ) : cleone gardens , recommended by lari , literally across the street from the ranch on the north end of fort bragg , with a number of rooms in the $ 85-$100 range , also some multi - bed rooms for a little more
; it looks nice and comfortable on the website though not really " fancy " ( there are links from lari 's site , www.horse-vacations.com ) .
and , as we all know , rides may start late , but they always end on time , so its important to be prompt to get our full riding time !
i 'm not sure how much earlier they could really do it ) .
i can ask our phoenix counsel if he can set up a meeting or give us an idea who can .
i 'd talk with aps just to find out more details .
the local counsel we use on electric matters is more of a gas attorney than an electric one , and the counsel we use for the sw gas matters is also aps 's counsel so he ca n't help us on these matters .
perhaps we could talk to aps to see what they are thinking .
that might be more enlightening than anything else .
i would think that we should take the time to talk with local counsel or other " allies " to get a feel for the chances in az .
i also think that the difficulty in az will be a physical problem with getting transmission service - no rto .
it would be great to have a thorough analysis of problems in every open market just to know what the issues are .
so , if there is a commercial interest in az , then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition ( and
that said , we do not get a great reception in az , and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success .
so , it is an opening , but i would let the commercial folks tell us how much it is worth to them , given the less than great odds .

mark - i know that we will talk on monday but thought that i would give you some preliminary thoughts on randy 's e - mail .
i can work with randy 's proposal that south america report directly to you .
but , from his reputation , believe that he could probably serve the same role if and when randy transitions to a new role at enron .
if frank sayre ends up staying with global assets to help with central america , he may want the same reporting structure .
that being said , i think that we can probably work this issue out with randy .
thanks - everything was sent out as draft as we do n't have all internal comments ( and we do n't even know abn 's position ! ) .
i think more thought should go into the mechanics and timing of what is going on here .
i will be available next week .

oneok can currently use ptr , or any other means it wants , to determine whether to call a " special test " of the accuracy of northern 's ultrasonic meters pursuant to section 2(e ) of the measurement proceduresagreement .
upon calling a special test , any concerns oneok may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters .
oneok has not called for a special test , but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning .
the outstanding imbalance situation at the plant , which dates to april and may of this year , must be resolved irrespective of what oneok desires to do going forward .
while a " path " can be either one line or a group of lines , it has a beginning and an end ( a por and a pod ) .
with respect to transmission grids , it can be used to describe both paths and flowgates .
when i wrote " the more granular the flowgate model " below , i meant " the larger the scale of your transmission model by flowgates " ; in fact , i had the " into wscc " example in mind at the time , whereby someone in the eastern interconnection could conceivably purchase a transmission right to send energy westward to a sink anywhere in the western interconnection .
i hate to always burden you with questions , but you are knowledgeable on these issues and i need to get up to speed .
i guess i owe you a few beers now .
i 'll reply to your comments in the order you wrote them .
bp 4 says , in essence , " before you sell a transmission right , make sure your grid can support it .
as written , the bp does n't seem to tie us to any particular transmission model , because the fragments could conceivably use any combination of physical and financial transmission rights .
we in the west have suggested a rewording of bp 1 , 10 and 12 ( hopefully , soon to be shared with the esc ) to allow regions like ours to minimize the operational impact of changing the frequency and duration of non - emergency generator ramping .
as drafted , these changes would have no effect on current practices in the east , so more than one version of each bp would be unnecessary .
i would say that bp 24 does not depend on the choice of congestion management method selected .
thank you , john , for your valuable input .
i would think both of these should be " dependent " , unless i am missing something .
this is not > intended to be the final review of the bps , rather it will help get some > actual work accomplished .

once a very active player in the race to construct new natural gas - fired generating plants , ls power announced in late 2000 plans to divest some 5,633 megawatts ( mw ) of natural gas - fired operating plants and projects in construction and advanced development .
ls power has not ruled out further development of new natural gas - fired power plants , but in recent months has announced aggressive plans for development of new coal - fired generating stations .
if built , these projects would be located in at least five different states and represent over 6,000mw coming into operation by 2007 .
announcements for an additional six coal - fired projects could be forthcoming by ls power over the next several months .

if you do the math , if you start out monday morning at 6 am and run the plant for 5 days a week for 15 hours a day , then come friday evening at 9 pm , there will be 44,400 gallons in the tank .
if you do the math , you could potentially run the plant for a full 15 hours on saturday , but at the end of the day you would only have 6,240 gallons left in the tank and you could not fill it in time for monday morning .
i will have to do a little more research on this one .
when we run the plant this summer , we can obviously get some better data .
the futures were done today , and if you could let me know of the corresponding counterparties as soon as you find out , that would be very helpful .
if there is anything i should know about your job or
how we might help each other work better , please let me know .

kern river open season kern river is holding an open season through aug. 18 to determine interest in year - round ft to nevada and california and interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm shippers .
the pipeline said it can offer significantly reduced ft rates based on recent ferc approval of kern river 's extended term rate program ( et program ) .
because system expansion can be accomplished by the addition of compression facilities , it could result in an overall lowering of rolled - in rates for all shippers , kern river said .
if goals can be met using relinquished capacity and no new facilities are required , new service could begin as early as oct. 1 , 2001 .
the new plant is on schedule to commence construction later this year , with start up 18 months later , he added .

natural gas can be bought from many supply sources and delivered to any market centre through an extensive north american pipeline grid .
in time , there will be a supply and demand response and accompanying relief in natural gas prices is expected .
it is difficult , if not impossible , to predict with certainty any movements in the commodity markets .
williams has placed its southcoast expansion project into service , increasing capacity on the transco pipeline system by 204,099 dekatherms per day to provide additional firm transportation capacity to serve markets in alabama and georgia .

while i 'd like to be helpful , i have never done a cash forecast before .
a week ago the west power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update enpower in " schedule " for all of the deals that flowed in december .
we heard from john postlethwaite that leslie did n't want us to update schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets .
i do n't care which way we move forward .
i am hoping that between don , leslie , and stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do .
as of now , there is little i can do to assist brandon with his request for a cash flow projection .
there are conflicting reports that houston , through the estate , will handle updating scheduling in enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating enpower accordingly .
what i am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible .
we have everything recorded on our trade sheets , but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the estate by us making the changes in deal scheduling , we can do so .
i also understand , after talking to john , you will be using our trade sheets for such changes for the month of december .
i 'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets , but if you can call me , we can set up a conference call
if there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know .
looking back on it , i would n't want it to have been any other way .
thanks for your friendship -- i treasure it .
we know how scary debt can be .
we can and will do the same for you !
our objective for tomorrow is to move through these and other issues you raise to outline a strawperson proposal for forward contracting , rate stabilization and tra undercollections .
as ralph 's email of sunday evening observed , if we manage to stay narrowly focused on these issues in the short - run we may have an opportunity to move the debate .
the first is our current structure , page 2 is what i would recommend to you and page 3 is the other practical alternative .
there 's no new info on my front , but i 'll let you know as soon as i hear something either way .
i 've asked randy rich to look into the other aspects of your questions , which we 'll discuss shortly .
the commission has a two - step process for determining whether the market finds an expansion project economically viable .
this first step ensures that a pipeline will not expand capacity if the demand for that capacity can be filled by existing shippers relinquishing their capacity .
the second step is that the expansion shippers must be willing to purchase capacity at a rate that pays the full costs of the project , without subsidy from existing shippers through rolled - in pricing .
my research has indicated that the commission has provided few specifics on how a reverse open season is to be conducted .
i 'll be up in a few minutes for our call to randy .
enron has tried to remain as neutral as possible on the renewables section due to our business interests in iowa with enron wind .
as i have stated in earlier updates , this bill most likely will not pass until the last few days of the session , sometime in mid april .

the advantage of the nordic model is that you have great liquidity for derivatives based on a broadly acknowledged system price .
i ca n't see how they 're going to solve this in germany .
but interested parties such as the deutsche boerse in frankfurt have acknowledged that a physical spot market needs to be in place before futures trading can be introduced .
using expertise gained in the nordic market , kjetil knutsen at nord pool consulting told dow jones that the plan is to develop a spot market in germany along the lines of the nordic model .
thomas , here is a quick update for calpine project .
key value driver will be a capacity payment ( $ /kw / month ) for 3 or 5 years , which we will charge to calpine .
as soon as we get vom from ee&cc , we will ask structuring group to get the capacity payment for 3 and 5 years .
i think this idea could be good if calpine is willing to pay more than what we see for next 3 or 5 year eastern pjm pool price , and/or we can leverage up more by taking advantage of 3 or 5 year tolling agreement .
i will continue to work on the model with ben and i will talk to scott to find out more .
although i got the feeling that if we wait on him to organize it it wo n't happen .

my concern would be that how do we know what % hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our fuel cost ?
i think that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel retainage .
but , if we retain fuel on ena transports , then we need to come up with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline .
this would mean we would purchase , transport and possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price .
the hold up in setting curves is we need a c$ forward curve .
if this curve was set sooner we could get ours out earlier .
as requested , please see the attached agreement .
i appreciate your help with this .

please let me know if there is someone else at enron whom i should speak with regarding this topic , or others that may be of interest to enron .

thanks to my friend nicholas bollini for assistance on this one .
delegates at the bonn climate change negotiations are expected to work through saturday to develop additional decisions that will " incorporate and give full effect " to the agreement .
further , developed countries want the u.s. on board and this leaves room for the bush administration to offer an alternative -- though the window of opportunity could close shortly .
it is too early to tell how these issues will impact competitiveness or whether they will be interpreted as non - tariff trade barriers .
further , only parties to the protocol can utilize the market - based mechanisms under the protocol ( emissions trading , and project - mechanisms in developing countries through the clean development mechanism , and project based mechanisms in other developed countries through joint implementation ) .
because the details are not yet worked out , it is unclear whether enron would be able to participate in mechanisms or trading through offices in other countries outside the u.s.
it will be important that the u.s. develop linkages with the market - based mechanisms to enhance a global market for greenhouse gas emissions credits and lower compliance costs for firms with obligations .
this could contribute to more costly and burdensome reductions in the future for u.s. firms ( as the u.s. could have a more stringent target to meet ) .
clean development mechanism and ji nuclear power projects are not permitted under the cdm or ji afforestation and reforestation are the only eligible sequestration projects under the cdm small project " fast track " window in the cdm for renewable energy projects < 15 mw , for efficiency and other projects equivalent to less than 15 gwh per year , and for new emitting projects that reduce emissions and with emissions of less than 15,000 tons per year .
most of you are aware that unify experienced some major performance issues as we tried to close out the month of july .
not to go into any details but there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the issues we saw on monday and to a lesser degree on tuesday .
jeff johnson and his team are putting together a plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for august .
the short term tactical plans include the following : enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the amount of data grows .
test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of sybase which will address some of the issues .
this may also require some hardware changes as to where we store certain data .
we will also need some user help in stress testing prior to moving to production .
this puts quite a load on the pma and accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see what if any action should be taken with these transactions .
once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little time to absorb the tremendous growth we 've been seeing via eol then we will focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions .
but we have to be sure it is the right solution in the long term .
jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed plan .
we will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical solutions .
in the mean time feel free to contact me at x-36858 or jeff at x-39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail .
i received a notice to provide feedback on jose marquez .
the west desk is very pleased with jose 's contribution .
vince , john woodley and catherine flax both are looking forward to talking with you today .
these are the 2 guys i mentioned that we should put in trading rotations .
both have expressed their strong desire to have their first rotation in trading and i think they would do a great job for us .
if you concur , please make a note to place them in trading for their first rotation .
i have attached both resumes for your reference .
i 'm working for an engineering consulting firm near the galleria , and i really enjoy it .
my lease was up at the gables at the end of october , so i have been looking for a townhouse for the last couple of months .
she is very nice and we get along just fine .
glad to hear that lucky is well .
i 'm also glad to be > back > in houston .
the new transco would n't be involved with ancillary services . "
and because the transco would both own and operate the system , it would have the necessary incentives to build more transmission , the cmua source says .
i do n't know how easily it would be to integrate it into an interstate market .
i hope you find it useful .
i hope you 're feeling better .
could you please come by before 2:30pm , if at all possible .
group , we are continuing to refine our deal entry techniques and spreadsheet techniques .
we are having great success with eol so far .
for example if we are lending with st - sw and we buy for them in np-15 .
finally , i will be out of the office for friday and will be in seattle through sunday .
thanks for the continued hard work and attention to detail , bill
we need to be sure that the counterparty is in a jurisdiction , and is the type of entity , that has been approved for financial trading with ena .
in order for us to prepare a master agreement for the counterparty you will also need to coordinate with credit in order for them to tell us what credit terms we need to include in the master agreement .
also , because ena does not trade brazilian power i believe you will have to work out an arrangement on the commercial side to have ena enter into the deal and back - to - back it out again to another appropriate enron entity to manage the risk .
, we are working on a financial swap transaction and need some information .
remi collognes suggested me to look for you .
is there any chance i can get a draft of a master swap agreement ?
please let me know if you or someone else can help me on the matters above .
should you have any questions you can reach me by e - mail or call 55 11 5503 1326 in sao paulo office .
but i 'm sure she could give you either a copy of the order or the cite address .
i 'll see what else i can find out .
we need to make sure we cover all of the expenses .

the good news is that i got a digital camera so there will be a lot more pictures available on the family album .
the bad news is that i got a digital camera and there will be a lot more pictures available on the family album .
anyways , its been update from christmas , check back after the new year as there will probably be more from our trip to the desert this weekend .
lousie seems to think that you are preparing the u.s. version of this .
vince , i have added a lot of material to " fill in the wholes " and would like your reaction to the current draft .
hope you are having a great day and tremendous start to the new year .
those should definitely be part of a class on risk management .
the last of the warm air will be scoured out of the east today with near to below normal temperatures for most of the country by early next week .
a very active southern jet stream could spin up two more significant winter storms through next weekend .
imagine the possibilities if only there was more cold air in the mix .
the current storm will probably drive out most of the available moisture , but some lake effect is possible so some light snow amounts should occur .
however , the set up looks favorable for some sort of low pressure to develop in the vicinity of the gulf coast early next week .
it would head toward the se us and could be an interesting factor .
it has had it for three runs in a row , but given the high surface pressures does not look as cold as i would have expected .
i look for most areas to run near or slightly below normal .
we are definitely going to need your accounting memo by tomorrow .
finally , there are some conceptual points that i believe should be discussed w/ relation to the unique structure for " softs " trading we have been planning .
i have to add up the numbers and decide whether i 'm going to fill potholes out on rt .
i have to add up the numbers and decide > whether > i 'm going to fill potholes out on rt .
i am leaving with regret , as i have enjoyed working with all of you , and i believe ebs is poised for great success in asia .
to assist in a smooth transition , i have prepared this report on the status of all ebs east asia regulatory affairs actions i am working on , and my thoughts about next steps .
again , many , many thanks for your support and encouragement and for what i have learned about broadband and ebs from each of you .
we can not proceed further on the application until we decide what legal entity to use .
this is a possible option in my opinion as the regulator ( ida ) does not want to be working at cross purposes with other parts of the government that wish to provide ebs with incentives .
for example it is possible that jan haizmann or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee ( done offshore for example ) .
jan i believe has some ideas on this that he adanced in the context of korea .
i believe it would still be prudent to proceed as we had planned to engage a law firm here in singapore ( as we have in hong kong and japan ) for the purpose of guiding us through these sorts of questions ( or at least confirming our reading ) and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by a working group headed by wayne gardner .
the contacts i would suggest discussing this with are andy haire and fiona yeo
i was to have gone to adl singapore next for a meeting to question them on how much of this they are able to do independently without reliance on us .
so , to be awarded pioneer status , which the edb is very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion , i believe we need to help edb demonstrate what the quantitative spin - off benefits are for singapore from our developing bandwidth trading here ( e.g. increased efficiencies of capacity utilization , effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment ) .
( d ) direct contact with edb on ebs 's plans edb ( chelsia lim ) has this week asked ebs to update her on its business plans for singapore .
i have made sure craig clark will take the responsibility for seeing this is handled .
( a ) status of system configuration plan : the plan is done in draft and is being held pending a decision to be communicated by roger estrada within the next week or two as to whether the lucent 10 g equipment described in the plan will be changed to other equipment .
the hk lawyers ( michelle chan of clifford chance ) have said that if we plan to provide other equipment at the outset , we ought to just wait and send in the correct description rather than revise .
when the system configuration plan is done in final , we also need to change the listed destination in the diagram from " san jose " to " west coast usa , japan , singapore , and australia " .
when we know what equipment we are going to be using , tom wei needs to revise the diagram and also make the changes in destination referred to above .
my successor should review the whole package once more with michelle chan in final .
someone needs to work with ebs legal to get the t and c 's for media cast to michelle or to set up direct channel between ebs legal and michelle chan as in the case of the exchanges on the t and c 's for bandwidth trading referred to above .
( d ) overall change of responsibility for ebs regulatory hk michael , or whomever will be taking over these responsibilities , should get from michelle chan of clifford chance hong kong a fresh copy of alison lindsay 's letter to xi xi of october 2000 stating that we received our licenses and setting forth in detail all of the requirements .
- we will need to be selecting an independent auditor to certify certain routine reports we may need to file in future .
once kim and chang starts work on this , someone from regulatory should be made available to help guide kim and chang on our regulatory questions , in coordination with robbi rossi .
the key e - mails are ( a ) one from me outlining the overall problem and some suggestions for dealing with it ; ( b ) one from jan haizmann with some additional and in some cases alternative suggestions on how to deal with it , ( c ) two from jae moo lee in korea with additional points of view .
art also responds to donald and roger estrada and relies on them for guidance and input .
art has prepared the amendment to our special type 2 license to add service to other destinations .
someone needs to be assigned responsibility for getting the amendment through .
i admit that i agree with the approach we are taking for now and can offer nothing better for the immediate term .
if we are going to make japan one of the centerpieces of our asia ebs strategy , i think we need to consider devoting more full time ebs regulatory resources to japan exclusively .
the allocation problem is that whatever regulatory resources we apply have to focus on immediate license amendment and operational questions that drive out time to work effectively on long term issues such as how to go about amending the telecommunications business law to allow bandwidth trading explicitly .
this would seem important to reduce long term risks to our business strategy .
" i had been giving intermittent support to helping scott yeager and justin cornett of ebs , and will reed of technology for all , figure out how to expand the concept of technology for all to asia .
the strategy was to utilize some of japan 's $ 15 billion pledge of funds to support digital divide activities in asia - to support the expansion into asia of the ebs - supported tfa model .
just in case there is any need for any interviews or meetings i will be available monday through wednesday or so .
not sure of your current situation or timing but wanted to let you know .
those were great pics of harris .... very handsome .
hello all : vince would like to schedule a meeting on tuesday , may 23 at 3:00 pm in conference room eb1938 .
this is a very interesting although somewhat complex assignment .
i would be pleased to discuss the attachments with you at your convenience .
we 'll send you an update if the dpr amounts move ( the dpr is n't final yet . )
please let me know if you need any additional information !
i would get out tomorrow if you would let me out .
this agency , which so far exists just on paper , could be used to build power plants and help run a state - owned transmission system .
with the state locking up so much of california 's future power needs , legislators openly wonder whether utility - rescue efforts are worth the billions of dollars they would require .
he credits the long - term power contracts with helping to cool the spot market for electricity , where prices in recent weeks have dropped sharply .
that was down from $ 243 in may , though still far above the $ 25-to-$27 range of two years ago .
but some worry about how this rush to address a short - term problem will affect the longer - term future .
the state has since hastily assembled a group of about 20 energy traders , headed by a 30-year - old manager with one year of experience in the energy business .
they managed to help lower current power costs , he notes , although that required signing deals that could force the state to " pay a little more " than it otherwise would have in the years ahead .
backers of the measure say it gives adequate opportunity for review without unduly slowing the bond offering . '

i do not have any negative information on any of these counterparties .
dth thanks for your help rick wadle
a direct access bill may move out of the senate to the house today or tomorrow -- sbxx 27 .
the help desk has resolved these problems , but in the process , we noticed that some of the files on the shared drive were still being viewed and updated by nng 's personnel over in dynegy 's offices .
would you please check on this concern as soon as possible ?
if you would , please update me on the status of this request .
thanks in advance for your prompt attention .
folks , this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of products .
it is our objective to develop derivative products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this exposure .
but it is important to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional .
thus , we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti - hurricane entities would be interested in regional products and the pro - hurricane entities would likely be more interested in bundled regional products depending on their exposure .
the data can be sorted by year , storm , or location on the u.s coastline .
as we move forward on the modeling front , the data will certainly need to be scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends , satellite availability , population trends , etc .
additionally , we need to go further back in time so long as the accuracy does n't decline .
on the marketing front , i am certainly open to ideas .
any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when we should approach customers .
please respond with any questions , comments or concerns on this project .
i will take a look at the transfer agreement .
i just want to make sure that all trades done after may 3rd and before the execution date that are being confirmed under arms will be transferred to utilicorp .
a few points that might not be obvious from the plans are : there will be a double porch across the back just like the front no dormers ( metal roof )
what i am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen .
that might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco .
also the front porch would be smaller .
i am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so i can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder .
i just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work .
i thought that since i had a such a detailed sketch , you might consider the job for less than the $ 6,000 that reagan allowed .
please complete to the best of your ability .
i will need to obtain your pre - ranking for both steve and jaime as well .
let me know your thoughts and i will gladly enter it into the pep system .
to ensure that you receive your first payment , you should : completely and legibly fill out the form .
thank you for your hard work and continued commitment to enron .
i think bob 's comments below are frank and pertinent and i endorse them fully .
the best way to handle this is to ask if enw will assure that their intercompany charges will not be like those currently received from epsc ( facilities ) .
i should ask if all of you are ok with this .
and i will be happy to get back to you .
because networks does work for all of enron , she has a need in her role to transfer dollars between networks and various other companies .
at this time , the security for the asset accountants is set up by business unit and an accountant can only perform an intercompany transfer within her business unit .
please approve new security role for the individuals who will need to make intercompany transfers across business units .
we can manage the security so that the individual can not create master data outside of her own companies and will have to rely on the other company 's accountant to set it up for the transfer .
let me know if you have any questions or if i can be of any help .
john and louise - based on your meeting with kevin and dave earlier today , i understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized .
i expect to have both an epc contract and permits in hand some time around sep ' 02 if we start with the expenditures in mid july ' 01 .
we can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed .
costs for a florida site will be similar ; however , expenditures will not start until we achieve site control .
my recommendation is to start fully developing the brownsville , tx site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit , as market conditions warrant .
i recommend holding off on significant expenditures in florida until we get more comfortable with site control .
marc , thank you for your e - mail concerning the master firm purchase / sale agreement , kindly forward your comments to my attention by e - mail or fax ( see # below ) and i will review same . on an expedited basis .
thank you for your attention to the foregoing .

annual paintball wars david , will and myself have come up with a great team - building idea .
i have narrowed it down to two possible weekends and need your help in identifying which would be the best for your respective groups .
november 18 - 19 please report back to me as soon as possible so that i may reserve the facility .
what i would like to do is start hosting a monthly meeting to give a status update on our projects .
it is nice to get a recap of what 's going on .
i think you might be getting a little ahead of yourself here .
i also think the delay in the calculation component could be a problem .
we do this because we do n't have the ability to key anything into either phoenix or mkm .
i want to make sure the process is thoroughly thought through here .
this is a business issue and i 'm not sure this should be reflected in your status report , but you do need to make sure steve gets on this .
clearly from this , i think good coordination and project management is still lacking in the rates / mkm world .
i have n't had a chance to study this yet , but i 'd like you guys to take a hard look at it and lets meet on mon or tues .
martha pls set up a meeting with these guys and i 'll talk to you about when i 'm going down .
i have pulled up some information on the project performance and wanted to share with the group .
i was very concerned by the comment that the project was on a rate to cost tw an additional $ 1.0 million for the year because the demand avoidance program was not in place .
i do want to confirm that arnold eisenstein at et&s working on the development of the programming to support tw 's efforts to minimize demand expenses .
i offer the following details regarding the actual operation of the station in 2000 .

if oneok were willing to reimburse nng ( regardless of test outcome ) , nng would be willing to purchase and fabricate spare meter spools in order to conduct this test with minimal impact to plant processing .
the agreement requires us to " cooperate " with oneok when a special test is called , and there are a number of issues we will need to cooperate on , including what to do for measurement while the meter is removed , which outfit to use to test the meter , and what the standards for testing the meter should be .
emily -- pls get a meeting set up for today if possible .
please plan to meet in the 4th floor conference room at 9:00 am tomorrow morning , wednesday , 3/27/02 , to discuss our new time keeping process .
, the city council has formed a committee to study ways of shielding temecula residents from similar jolts when the deregulation wave washes into riverside county in a couple of years .
we now know what can happen , and we do n't want to be caught asleep .
those cities are studying the experience of palm springs , which in 1997 contracted with portland gas and electric to provide residents with a flat rate for electricity for five years .
naggar said the council has yet to form a committee charged with monitoring san diego gas&electric 's proposal to string new lines across huge metal towers through southwest county , to relieve san diego 's electric rate explosion .
if they decide to go down the middle of temecula , i can assure you we 'll make a move .
if they decide to go through the ( santa rosa ) plateau , i can assure you we 'll discuss it .
temecula council members have been unanimously opposed to bringing new power lines through , or near , the city since the project was unveiled about two months ago .
he said he 'll get back with you if we need a meeting with rupert .
in addition to those answers , we should keep in mind that market value can not necessarily be calculated with mathematical precision .
in looking at the applicable indices for those two pipelines for some of the sample months , it is clear that , if $ .10 or $ .11 were deducted from the index price , then the resulting price would still be in the range as published by inside ferc .
a quick review of other months shows that sometimes the range was narrower , and the adjustments would take you outside the range .
vepco i think it may be true , but not correct .

fyi - i was in the midst of negotiating an isda with bsil for enron corp. with respect to potential forward deals .
nancy has informed me that bear stearns will be doing a large trade with enron north america corp. ( " ena " ) very soon .
bear stearns would like for the isda master agreement with ena to mirror the isda master agreement dated july 3 , 2000 between enron credit limited and bear stearns .
if this master agreement has been executed , please make an entry for it in lotus notes .
also , please e - mail me a copy of the execution version of the enron credit limited and bear stearns master agreement for legal and credit in houston to review .

thank you very much -- it will jumpstart my shopping .
please note that erica gut and mahesh lakhani will be providing tax support for the credit trading group in the future and they will work with denis to put the appropriate service agreements / fee arrangements in place .
i agree with denis ' remarks especially about there being a single book and hence the need for matching terms and back - to - back trades .
from a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate trading book should be mainatined by ena .
in situations where ena has sold protection and .com has bought protection on the same name this internal structure will permit ena immediately delivering on the portfolio of deliverable obligations it as received as the seller of protection to .com which can in turn can deliver on to the counterparty it has bought protection from .
mark , paul can you add further clarification as to the position ( particularly where i have n't hit the mark ! ) .
we should try to close the open issues next week .
could you coordinate the relevant parties to ensure satisfactory results .
please could you confirm that cds trades done by ena : 1.can be booked in london ; 2 . risk - managed in london 3 . do not have to be back - to - backed with enron credit.com 4 .
my understanding of this is that we would not need to match the terms of transactions , for example where ena has sold protection and enron credit.com has bought protection on the same name .
your response will be greatly appreciated .
enron does support the reliability bill but we will insist on adding transmission access and functional separation language later in the process while eei will insist on adding puhca while appa will insist on adding private use ( thus , we can see what the final consensus will look like ; plus we have been involved in drafting the consensus in all these provisions ..... but timing and sequence are crucial . )
mark - up will likely be scheduled to occur during the week of june 26th .
i just got off the phone with pat who walked me through the draft he was submitting this evening to barton ( once it is officially transmitted , i will be able to get a copy to you , likely on monday or tuesday . )
please call should you need clarification or have questions .
many thanks for your continued support .
enroll now for pushing the envelope , a completely free two - hour seminar that will teach you how to take your email and integrated online marketing efforts to the next level .
she says the deal is definitely not entered correctly , but because it was done for the days when we got hit with transmission cuts , she wants to look into it a little further before she changes or kills it .
thanks for your patience , kate melissa ann murphy 12/13/2000 04:40 pm
hello , i think that deal # 476147 might should have been entered as a buy resale instead of as transmission .
if you would not mind looking into this and letting me know i would appreciate it .
yes , i would be happy to .
i would like to get some time on the schedule to review the plan for energy both in north america and europe .
it seems to me that we ought to have a meeting in frankfurt in sept and a seminar on energy in houston over the next six months .
i wanted to encourage your institutions to consider adhering to the 2001 euro protocol .
details can be found on our website , www.isda.org , under the protocols page .
please feel free to contact me with any questions you might have .
oh well , i 'll see you next week .
we 're going to try for the conference room next to bob hall 's office , but if that 's taken we 'll just meet at frank 's desk .
i guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year .

tom , i appreciate the background on issues with peter 's funding .
if you have a copy of the current ieee draft , i 'd appreciate seeing it in order to compare / contrast with the aep / aps proposal .
therefore , before working with peter chamberlain make sure that the dpca is funding him from dues and not an assessment that we might end up having to pay for ( i think peter may not be retained by dpca since the dpca is restructuring including looking at substantial increase in dues ) .
i would be happy to take a look at what aep / aps are proposing as long as there 's no immediate time frame .
also , i 'm not sure what you mean about earlier versions of p1547 having sections deleted .
over the next several weeks , we have the opportunity for input .
jeff and tom , i would like to send copies of aep's?aps 's requirements for dg connection for your review , if you are interested .

i think that on the physical side we could probably agree to the language you financial guys select .
at the suggestion of ron nolte of the ena it group , it would be easiest if we could create a variable which would populate non - eol deals with the language in question thus leaving eol deals pristine .
i know there have been a lot of changes ; therefore , i need your help to update the list .
please send me your revisions by noon on friday , august 25th .
in addition , if you need to forward this document to someone else in you group , please do so .
we will update as we receive more information .
please add leboe to your distribution .
o iep?s internal polling shows rosenfield?s proposal has weaknesses that could be exploited dd including the price tag and the image of a state - run energy department that could be compared to the dmv and caltrans .
o rosenfield would have a difficult time funding a campaign , especially raising the resources to overcome a strong , well funded " no " campaign .
voters are concerned about giving their approval to changes that could make things worse .
we recommend using this outline as a starting point to develop an effective campaign plan that could successfully defeat rosenfield if he pursues an initiative strategy .
we believe rosenfield could submit a measure to the attorney general as late as september , 2001 and still qualify the initiative for the november 2002 ballot dd especially if the summer months produce power blackouts , skyrocketing energy bills , and the image of a bungling governor , legislature and regulators .
o paid signature gathering firms could be put on contract for industry - related business dd thus keeping these firms off the table for rosenfield .
initially we believe the " no " campaign should focus on testing and developing the following messages : o the measure will hurt taxpayers .
this research would also be important in efforts to secure the most favorable ballot title and summary possible to our goal of defeating it .
our experience shows that the ballot title and summary can swing initial vote margins either way by as much as 10 points .
a focused earned media campaign would greatly enhance the chances for success and editorial support and op - ed?s can provide important third party credibility to the no campaign .
campaign costs how much will be needed to defeat rosenfield will depend on several factors .
the more they like it on the natural , the more expensive it will be to defeat the measure .
thorough research of rosenfield?s actual proposal will better enable us to recommend a campaign plan , message and budget .
hi everyone , attached please find your fall 2001 schedule .

for information , visit www.desert-crossing.com judge to decide on ubs deal for enron 's trading unit ubs 's proposed acquisition of enron 's energy trading business could be worth between $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion to enron over the next several years , according to testimony given to the bankruptcy judge last week .

the changes , which should be ready for discussion in a few weeks , could cause ratings to rise or fall faster , affecting companies ' ability to raise money .
moody 's is preparing a special comment on the matter that should be issued in a few weeks .
the changes could include more multi - notch upgrades or downgrades of company ratings ; a speeding up of rating reviews into a matter of weeks , rather than a few months ; and perhaps the elimination of rating outlooks .
a policy shift could have the effect of making it more difficult for borderline credits to survive an economic downturn .
if moody 's moves ahead with the changes , it could mark a major structural change in the corporate bond market that could lead to structurally higher volatility .

this year will be , in fact , the 20th anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining us to celebrate what we have learned and what we have n't about the economics of network industries .
fred kahn , al philipps , bill hogan and a number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and the prospects for the future .
the conference will take place at a beautiful site in the poconos , about 90 minutes north of philadelphia , from wednesday afternoon may 24th to friday afternoon may 26th .
you can check for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site / hotel at the following website url : michael crew and i would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an after dinner speaker on thursday evening ( may 25th ) , just before the key research reviews of friday morning take place on the electricity , telephone and gas industries , and following a day of special topics on emerging power markets and other developments in network industries .
naturally we would be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference , but knowing your schedule , you may only have time for a part of it .
your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price discovery and efficient risk management for market participants , in energy markets and more generally .
both michael and i feel that your perspectives on the " new science of risk management " and what can be expected from it could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event .
please let me know ( and please do copy michael on your response ) whether your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event .
michael and i would , of course , be very happy to follow up with you in discussing the nature of the presentation , participants and so forth , if this is a go .
pls , forward these to tammy sheppherd to incorporate in the ena ooc reports .

since the equipment is owned by westlb and since the feeling is we do n't want to involve westlb in the transaction , the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the westlb facility .

in re m / v pacific virgo britt thanks for the great summary .
although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing , jones feels strongly that it will be most cost - effective for ect to proceed with a joint analysis only after making this determination .
by today , jones should have sent the proposed testing program to technichem , in order to get the ball rolling , and with the expectation that technichem will have comments that will require time to incorporate .
afterwards , for the additional testing in england to determine whether the inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt , jones estimates another 2,000 pounds for the cost of the lab ; he does not know at this point whether he would attend the entire testing procedure , which he believes could be completed in about two days .
if he attended both days , this additional testing in england would run to another 3,440 pounds , or $ 4,988 .
sgs will spend another sgd 2,000 purchasing the necessary chemicals for the joint testing , and bill for another sgd 2,000 for pre - joint - analysis development work ( basically , practicing on extra samples from the pacific virgo ) .
sgs estimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis sgd 9,500 , or about $ 5,523 .
( 3 ) captain gregory of noble denton , the ship operation expert we would probably use for testifying , has been asked to do no work on this matter at this time .
another $ 5,325 will be necessary to get ready for the joint analysis ; another $ 18,000 to perform the joint analysis in singapore , and another approximately $ 5,000 to perform specialized testing in london after the joint analysis is done ( if steve jones determines that such further testing is necessary ) .
due to a scheduling conflict , mark frevert will not be able to speak at the ets floor meeting on the 41st floor tomorrow .
please join us tomorrow , thursday , february 1 , at 2:00 pm by the fax center on 41 .

verizon south to implement second phase of expanded local calling future of regulation washington bill could erase price list requirement for competitive carriers
the staff said that if the bill is passed , the commission would follow up with a rulemaking proceeding , which would allow the industry to weigh in on whether to modify or eliminate the price list requirement .
sb 309 would help implement the act by requiring the director of the department of finance and administration to determine how to assign the place of primary use .
the director either could provide vendors with a database linking taxing jurisdictions to addresses or ask vendors to use an extended zip code at least nine digits long .

i think we will never be able to build a single black box to value volatility , otherwise markets will cease to exist and we in risk will be out of business .
however , it will be possible to build a framework to structure volatility modeling process .
like the general equilibrium modeling approach you proposed .
atleast we can agree on the key drivers of supply and demand and the significant variables of a fundamental model .
i hope we get to have a continuing discussion on this topic .
i would also request if you could please send me a copy of you power point presentation .

and while the decision on bouman wo n't be made at least until after the vikings see what he can do in practice today , wynn appears to be edging closer and closer to his first action in a vikings uniform .
at first glance wynn looks like the prototype of a quarterback .
but , like a good - looking automobile in a showroom , nothing will be known for sure until he 's actually taken the offense for a serious spin .
the outcome may not have been what i would have liked .
i feel more comfortable with myself and my abilities having gone through it .
dennis green , who has done a good job of developing quarterbacks , was happy to trade a fifth - round draft choice for wynn and running back travis prentice .
i think he has a lot of athletic ability , he 's a good competitor , a very smart player , had the right height .
wynn said the extra reps this week will have him as prepared as he can be .
it 's a golden opportunity for him with culpepper out
hopefully , we 'll know more late tonight .

to provide its customers with additional assistance this summer and next , san diego gas & electric ( sdg&e ) has requested from the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) $ 16 million over the next two years to increase funding for energy - efficiency programs .
our customers need assistance today in lowering their energy costs and today 's proposal will bring an additional $ 16 million funding to encourage energy conservation in our region , " said edwin a. guiles , president of sdg&e. " this money can be used to help replace old , inefficient appliances , such as air conditioners and refrigerators , which will result in reduced electric bills and less strain on our state 's electric - supply system .
of the $ 16 million , sdg&e would allocate an additional $ 4.3 million exclusively for low - income energy - efficiency assistance programs over the next two years .
under the proposal filed friday , the low - income assistance funds will be used to expand existing programs , such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler replacements , while introducing new programs , including room air - conditioner replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair .
details on the programs are still being developed , but they should be in place in early september .
friday 's proposal marks the latest in a series of actions sdg&e has taken recently to help customers grapple with high electric prices .
that proposal , combined with the deregulation - dividend checks most sdg&e customers will receive next month , will result in a total of about $ 500 million benefit to them in august and september -- nearly$300 for the typical residential customer -- helping to ease cash - flow problems from higher electricity prices .
those customers participating in the plan will see bills this summer that are comparable to last summer 's bills .
sdg&e also has increased communications to both residential and business customers regarding the changes in the energy marketplace , available energy - efficiency funding and conservation tips for reducing electric bills .
i hope you are well today .
hope you enjoyed risk 2000 in boston and it was nice to see you again .
dear rick , in september , i started a new job with another electric cooperative in north alabama near decatur and huntsville .
i hope that between my efforts and having a few new board members that things will smooth out here .

elizabeth & janice : i put on the fax to you two articles from today 's wsj that i thought you would have some interest in if you have not seen the journal today .
thus , as we are contracting with various iou counterparties ( even the straightforward t&d companies ( i.e. , those without generation ) that traditionally were looked at as very safe from a credit perspective , we will need to be mindful ( and perhaps get up to speed ) on the state regulatory rules applicable to the recovery of wholesale power purchase prices by the those utilities , particularly since those counterparties could be adversely affected by deals other than ours .
we will obtain a copy of the ppas to see if there is anything of particular interest vis - a - vis the questions i spoke about the other day with janice -- but my guess is that , since the buyers are ious , the ppas will look more like the pilgrim , clinton and oyster creek ppas that janice and i spoke about that are fairly " stripped down " and do n't reflect many of the provisions we typically would want .
i 'll follow up with janice on this .
please prepare execution copies and forward for signature .

total positive ctc owed to utility of $ 1,749,741 average ctc for these customers of $ 24.11/mwh without opining on whether we owe these or not , i still need to figure out whether they 've been booked and if so how , and as more come in we need to figure out what to do with them .
do we think that they can be offset against any negative ctc 's that pg&e owes us .

would it be possible to play around with the demo ?

the energy supply crunch eased slightly as grid operators pumped up the cushion between supply and demand , and for the first time in more than five weeks the statewide power grid was operating under a relatively mild stage 1 emergency .
the utilities need the state 's help to buy electricity , as wholesale prices have soared since may and supplies have been stretched to the limit .
but he added that edison has shown more good faith and interest coming into the negotiations , which began tuesday in san francisco .
economic uncertainty for more than a month , the state 's transmission grid has been operating under either a stage 2 or stage 3 emergency , indicating extremely tight reserves .
hill made no prediction about whether that would happen .
if you need more , there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts ( we heard about it in amsterdam ) that i think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets .
but i can find out from bob pickle if you want .
we should include isda energy definitions ,
i might also add a few items about international developments and the eei physical power trading form .
the dollar amount should be spelled out just like a check on the line below " pay to the order " .
also , please make sure that the amount is typed in for the first paragraph of the statement .
i understand that for each curve below , there are unique names for forward basis and intra - month .

i am focusing on poverty because it is a global scourge and we would have a better world if poverty could be reduced drastically .
markets for the goods and services of developing countries will shrink , as will investment in them .
thus one may make a case for directing more resources to developing countries , but they must be part of a viable development program .
the discussion of poverty reduction can be brought specifically to the situation in the middle east and south asia .
donor countries and agencies can give advice and provide technical and financial resources , but they can not impose programs that national leaders do not want , a lesson that has been learned repeatedly .
the donors can not insist that dictatorial regimes be transformed into democracies ; they can withhold aid or they can grant it and hope that some start at development will lead to more satisfactory regimes .
however , the job is far from accomplished and deserves a sustained effort to do better in the future .
the quantities confirmed to flow for your account are available on the internet navigator after 5:30 p.m. eastern time on wednesday , june 6 , 2001 .
i started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara .

when january 2002 invoices are run , please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ena 's contract 24924 .
however , we will need to discuss further .
the invoice that will be generated to ena will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release .
we can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches .
i believe you wanted that guarantee to be for us$ 5million

i know that we said it might be best if my first month with enron were worked in houston , but it now seems wisest to put that off for a while .
i am working on this now and will be working more with don and the team this morning .
after receiving their comments , i will summarize and forward .
high hi dan and tom , greetings .
i hope all is well with both of you and ppg .

i 'll follow up with you next week .

ees billing / settlements function john - the current functional reporting structure of billing & settlement 's through ees poses near term and long term tactical risks we feel jeopardizes our ability to meet our goals and objectives .
john , could we convene a meeting if necessary for you to address these issues .
i will be out next week and would like to leave knowing that we are on the path to getting this resolved .
i will probably sum up for group tomorrow based on all responses i received and recommend we leave as is .
the suggestion is that the support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement .
i would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people .
with regard to your header : i 'm glad to hear that you 're thin , ing of changing it b
i started to run through the permutations of where you might have been going with that , ie : hung like a horse , etc ...
i should have realized that there was a good chance that you work for enron ; what a nightmare ! ugh .
of course , i think there 's a good chance they 'll hang out in bankruptcy for awhile
so hopefully the workforce impact wo n't be terrible .
in any case , i would like to hear how that progresses ...

amitava , thank you for the detailed info on the required data and thoughts on its scope .
also agree that we 'll almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust model off more comprehensive data to start with .
static historical snapshot+performance data for model development mike , scott , eric , after brainstorming and discussing further on data here , we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows : we need bankrupt , default and nondefault ( which covers nonbankrupt ) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot .
monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period .
we will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights .
for the purpose of model validation , we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance .
this means that we will need rolling ( 4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance ) data for 4 monthly shifts : input snapshots performance 1999 march end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end , 1999 december end 12 month end performance for jan 2000 through dec 2000 1999
we will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator , if available during the performance period .
this will require d&b to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly .
we do , however , thank you for the opportunity and wish you success in this endeavor .
please try to make the columbia matters more of a priority and if you need to , tana is available to help out on the day to day stuff .

republicans wondered about the ability of the alternative generators to be online , a sentiment shared by the industry .
davis turns to bankruptcy court for help in plan to buy power grid ;
but the committee will play an important role in any reorganization plan that is ultimately hammered out in u.s. bankruptcy court . ? ?
but they liked parts of it , asked good questions , and i thought it was a good beginning .
the reaction to the figures reflects a growing rift between democrats and republicans over how best to solve the state 's problems .
their good fortune , though , has come with a measure of ambivalence and may well be short - lived .
grant county public utility district , which has just 40,000 retail customers , is using its windfall to help build a $ 70 million fiber optic network for local residents .
the utility estimates that those generators could add $ 50 million to profits in the coming year . ? ?
like chelan , grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to insulate its customers from high market prices for electricity , when , as now , local needs exceed generating capacity in the river .
drought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be sold on the spot market -- 10 to 20 times as much as last year 's price -- it has strengthened a compelling bottom - line rationale for conservation .
we have a wonderful energy fit , " mr. smith said , referring to bc hydro 's power - trading relationship with california , if not to californians themselves .
questions about profit gouging on the part of dam - dependent utilities in the northwest may soon be moot .
electricity generated by rock island dam in chelan county , wash. , helped the county 's public utility earn a record $ 58.2 million in profits last year .
we 're confident that if we had a full hearing of the facts , we would have been exonerated entirely .
and i do believe we should build more plants and produce more energy , but at the same time , we must become more energy efficient .
i do n't think we need to sacrifice our environment in order to move ahead .
i 'm not sure what ferc has to do with helping them collect their money .
ferc asked for comments on whether the surcharge " would help to increase production by creating a greater assurance that generators will be
williams , who has taught in the agricultural engineering and bioresources department for 18 years , hopes to have the project running full time by june .
he said the entire project 's costs could be recouped in 12 years or less , depending on how fast energy costs increase . ? ?
he started working on the project in 1998 and has worked in this field for 25 years .

processes are now under way to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity into california , and el paso intends to do its part to help satisfy whatever needs may be established today .
if california had taken advantage of the opportunity in 2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999 , reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in prices at the california border could have been substantially mitigated or avoided .
finally , the increased power costs in california could have been substantially mitigated through long - term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short - term power market .
california is currently in a difficult position , but now has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long - term energy policy , " said dunn .
el paso has been one of the largest suppliers of energy to california for more than 50 years , and we are actively participating with all parties in california to be a part of a long - term , stable solution to california 's energy needs .
some analysts believed that gas inventories could climb to a record 3.15 tcf in the three remaining weeks of stock - building season .
day - ahead energy costs in the northwest got a good boost friday on the typical risk associated with trading three days out , and on reduced hydroelectric output during the peak hours .

weather forecasts called for slight cooling early in the new week , but temperatures were expected to remain at above - normal levels .
monday temperatures were expected to be warmer , but the hot flash should be short - lived as below normal temperatures were forecast for october 25 to 29 .
heavy load energy costs for monday delivery were seen trading in a slightly wider range on friday , gaining ground on the high end .
temperatures through tuesday were expected to be above normal in the 50s and 60s , while the latest six - to - ten from the nws called for below - normal temperatures from october 25 to 29 .
november forward contracts also rose , with reported prices as high as 23.3$/mwh .

as mentioned above , ga contribution could be in two areas , namely dealing the regulatory commission ( merc ) , and third party sales .
starting with the later , third party sales , it is perhaps the most important point in the renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment ( incidentally , enron 's commitment in the project is between $ 0.65 and $ 0.825 billion -- with b -- depending on what to include and exclude ) .
i shall keep you posted with progress , meanwhile , please let me know if you have any questions and/or advise .

you raise a good point in that we should be prepared to say ( again , on a non - binding basis ) how long we will need to close ( in addition to increasing the bid on the units ) .
i think if our number is good , 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work , but i think we should also be willing to post some non - refundable $ s within say , 2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with sithe .
the group 's thoughts on this would be appreciated .
i would guess the most critical from a timing perspective will be a response centered on price and commercial / technical issues .

after a brief furor when the saudi government announced that the u.s. would not be able to expand its operations at the prince sultan airbase near riyahd , us - saudi cooperation has improved .

in order to reach this goal , i had projected last summer that dynegy might be looking to merge with another provider to build its scale , considering the fierce competition it faces from other generation companies .
the addition of sierra pacific 's facilities , combined with other assets that the company has acquired or developed this year , increases dynegy 's generating capacity by more than 4,000 gross megawatts .
another possible trend is the joint activity we are seeing between companies .
as the energy industry becomes more competitive , like - minded companies may find that they can actually gain more by developing similar strategic alliances , rather than following a insular path typically exemplified by , for example , southern company .

we would very much like to invite enron to sponsor these special editions either fully or in part , and to use our publication as an effective means of conveying your position on the critical issues that will be discussed to the audiences in qatar and new york in a position to do something about them .
enron could contribute any amount it wishes .
the second has been between issues with high p / es and those with low p / es .
but such defensive issues may still be worth buying to balance a portfolio that has been overloaded in tech .
i doubt , however , that oil can remain above $ 30 a barrel for more than a year or two -- today 's high prices will bring on more supply and an economic slowdown could reduce demand .
as a result , i think energy stocks may have seen the best parts of their gains .
you can either buy good tech values and ride out any further decline or wait until they look fully washed out .
but be smart -- diversify with a value fund or a fund that holds mid- and small - caps with an average p / e below 20 .
it took us a few months to negotiate our new coast - to - coast fares because we wanted the best deal possible .

unfortunately , during this holiday season a record number of travelers will take to the friendly skies which translates into huge crowds and limited parking at the airport parking lots .

also , the group is somewhat optimistic that the ferc order in november could be an order on the merits , without additional proceedings such as a technical conference or a hearing .
but as stated earlier , we recognize that not all parties fully support all aspects of the final documents , therefore we look for you to provide us input on the outstanding issues and those inclusions in the final documents and the anopr that you do not fully support .
the alliance has also identified several issues we believe could be used as a basis for comments .
we strongly encourage your company to participate on the call and file in support of those inclusions in the collaborative document that benefit the generator community , e.g. , designation as network resource , strict time lines for tos to comply with with regards to studies , etc .
we want to stress to ferc the " best practices " from a generator perspective .
please reply back to this e - mail if you or someone from your company plans to particpate on the call .
we believe it prudent to insert a generator perspective on the cost allocation issues in this pleading to ferc on february 1 .

i have a strong interest in pursuing a career in the energy industry?with a top energy company like?enron , where my abilities and qualifications can be fully applied for our mutual benefit .
while there , i was afforded the opportunity to?develop a forward view model?for?off- peak?electricity price forecasting and analyze the data sets of a fundamental?model to create forward price curves .

meeting monica , can we meet for more than 1 hour tomorrow ?
the highlighted issues need further discussion between credit and legal or otherwise need some research .
based on the sheer number of comments the counterparty has made i would recommend that after we have discussed and/or researched our open issues that i prepare a blackline with those changes we can accept and send it back to the counterparty for their further review .
after they have had a chance to determine what they want to continue pursuing we can then get on the phone to discuss a more narrowed list of open issues .
let me know if this is how you want to proceed .
counterparty has agreed to leave in the additional events of default .
paul has also agreed to specify an additional event of default for enron --
the changes to the last documents to be delivered section on page 3 should be ok if the documents mentioned are for the correct counterparty .
we will include a representation that both parties qualify as eligible contract participants and eligible commercial entities in lieu of part 5(b)(h ) .
we have new language we can propose in lieu of part 5(e ) .
credit wants to discuss the counterparty changes on " relevant price " .
credit has agreed to modify paragraph 13(g)(i)(1 ) relating to party a to reflect the change to the additional event of default .
credit has agreed to modify paragraph 13(g)(i)(1 ) relating to party b to reflect the change to the additional event of default .
therefore , we will need to either create a new location name ( what would be the " new " location name ? )
or we can advise the customers via a ticker message that the product description for " hpl / aguad " has been revised .

kinder morgan & cannon interest have there own deal and kinder morgan has been pretty flexible in the past , so i do not think it would be a problem .

jim , sorry about the delay in correspondence , but we have been reviewing the history of the previous transactions .
we would greatly appreciate any information that you might have about the kinder assignment as well as your thoughts about pursuing the deal directly with kinder .

jeff and i will work to merge the legal issues into the full presentation , subject to the duscussion on the conference call tomorrow morning .
this presentation has been prepared in anticipation of the fact that we will likely be limited to a very short verbal presentation tomorrow .
the premise is obviously preaching to the choir , and we ( as i am sure others do as well ) have a string of proposals starting with sdges in may or june that , if we melded their timing and their prices into the attached timeline would be very damaging to thinking people .
do we really think that we could get some sympathy for returning to a market based structure ?
( note that the addition of prices could not be done , i do not think , without naming companies , so we would be there , partially revealed . )
my vote : if it does not hurt us ( competitively , pr , etc . ) , if it is legal , and especially if it can help make even a small amout of progress towards a market based structure , i would do it .
- at the very least , we should feed our own proposals and their prices into this timeline .
privately , we could show it to various parties on a case by case basis to advance our cause .
promotion of the track i will contact each supervisor of the attached list of candidates to gain further feedback on these candidates , prior to contacting them , and ensure their respective buy - in .
i look forward to working with you on this track .
i am available after lunch but will be out of town for the socal celebration party in la .
i suggest a quick conference call to discuss .

there is a related but different issue you can discuss with paul simons that came up in connection with the zuma 2000 trading system in london .

if the system you have in mind will be for the physical commodities , we should include jeff hodge in the discussion .
i am copying paul on this note since it makes sense to coordinate with him since he has already dealt with similar issues .

i just want to be sure your team and our team are closely coordinating on the elba island tolling agreements ( your team ) and gas sales agreements ( our team ) .
and i want to be sure this is all worthwhile .
there is a considerable amount of money to be made depending on your view of the long - term supply curve for lng .
southern co. was in town last thursday to visit us and les agreed to start working on a letter of intent with southern co for the sale of gas from the terminal .
we have been asked to work up a good price for gas at elba by les .
co. has some leverage with el paso that can be instrumental in helping les with his negotiations below .
we should be better prepared to talk about this by wednesday .
drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel , so please advise us re any additions in that regard .
at the same time , this decision by southern lng will focus our resolve to complete the commercial transaction with el paso merchant energy .
we will discuss the path forward with el paso merchant energy on november 21 - 22 , 2000 .
while we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our commercial flexibility and optionality intact , we must be positioned to move forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both el paso merchant energy and southern lng .
we indicated we would be asking southern lng to bifurcate the ferc proceeding into the vaporizer project , that could proceed quickly and on an independent path to certification , and the stabilization project , that required considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed .
he said he would like to prepare us an outline of an offer .
mr. varagona also indicated that he did not see how the letter agreement / term sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our respective companies - " it just wo n't work ! " .
apparently , these gentlemen have developed a good working relationship over the years .
however , we may find it desirable to reach some commercial resolution with el paso merchant energy for a portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear .
i would recommend any compromise with el paso merchant energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with southern lng on explicit terms acceptable to us ( and checking it twice ) .
i would appreciate receiving your comments , if any , before thanksgiving .
fran has informed me that as soon as she has this information she can account for the credit to the short term west hourly book ; but as you can see by the attached e - mail , risk has only accounted for july variances , not august , in this pma .

but i do n't think citing policy gaps for not having it done is helpful at this stage .
this would help to reduce the noise we are having around the process and close one more door .
new product approvals james , further to your comments yesterday on the absence of a policy for new product approvals , as far as i am aware there is no explicit policy by rac for approval of new products , other than the extent to which a new product is covered under this paragraph in the risk policy manual:- vi / a. subject to the authorization of the board of directors , the enron corp. chairman , the president of enron corp. and the enron corp. chief risk officer , additional portfolios may be created and additional commodity groups may be added within existing portfolios , and the related limits will be created or revised accordingly .
the president of enron corp. and the enron corp. chief risk officer can authorize additional positions within the existing commodity groups , provided that such positions can be aggregated within the limits of a currently authorized commodity group .
rac 's concern is not with the operational issues around new products , but about whether or not those products are aggregated in the overall corporate risk reporting .
from your side , are you able to put together some operational guidelines , if none already exist ? regards lloyd < embedded picture ( device independent bitmap )

enron 's financial woes may prove to be a drag on dynegy 's earnings next year if the transaction is completed , analysts said .
enron 's bankers have met with unidentified investors , including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies , in a bid to shore up the energy trader 's finances with an injection of as much as $ 2 billion , the new york times reported yesterday , citing unidentified executives close to the companies .
enron needs to raise $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion in cash within the next 45 days , said sean egan , managing director of egan - jones rating co. ` ` their trading operation has burned through cash faster than the market had expected , ' '
enron has said fourth - quarter earnings would be reduced partly by a drop in its energy - trading business .
` ` you need to know enough about the ( energy ) business to know whether it 's a good deal , and then you need to be confident in the dynegy team , ' ' he said .
` ` they would possibly hold it for years , because they like slow exits . ' ' kkr is also a possible candidate because it recently raised a new $ 5 billion buyout fund .
any lbo firm would need assurance about how it will get its money back on an enron investment , said snow .
` ` if there 's a chance dynegy would agree to buy out ( the lbo firms ' ) stake over time , that would give some confidence .
that means the private equity portion would have to approach $ 1 billion or more .
--the carlyle group could invest through a $ 1 billion energy fund it 's raising , as well as its general u.s. buyout fund , said snow .
the firm recently raised about $ 1.5 billion for new investments , about one - third of what it had hoped to raise , and has said it will focus on ` ` back- to - basics ' ' investments in food , manufacturing and media .
msn had planned to have fast internet access over telephone lines available , with help from energy trader enron , in 45 markets starting oct. 25 .
slower expansion msn has been selling high - speed access in 14 states under partnership with qwest communications international inc. for the last few months .
plans to expand marketing are also on hold , visse said .
laszlo does n't think msn or america online can build the kind of lead in the high - speed market that america online has in the slower dial- up access market .

and we agreed that wessex water and enron direct should help each other going forward .
given that wessex is enron 's biggest retail platform in europe , have you given any thought as to how it could be closer integrated with enron direct generally ?
there could obviously be some regulatory issues in bringing our retail water and energy businesses together , though i think it is worth looking at .
ed has 150,000 i&c customers across the uk , making it a good fit for wessex .
also , if the water market opens up to competition in the future , there would be benefits for wessex .

as part of its effort to tackle california 's energy woes , ferc staff has been studying the state 's pipeline infrastructure to see if there are ways to improve the delivery of gas .
the acc is becoming increasingly concerned with the pipeline capacity situation in arizona and whether current natural gas shippers in arizona , with existing contract rights on the el paso system , will receive reliable pipeline service in the future , " wrote the commission .
additionally , it appears that little or no additional pipeline capacity will be added by el paso in the near future to serve existing cus - tomers and their existing contract rights , beyond the line 2000 expansion which will largely replace capacity that has been lost for other reasons .
el paso recently won approval for line 2000 , which will boost deliverability into califor - nia by as much as 230 million cfd .
according to shippers in texas , arizona and new mexico , el paso has proposed a new allocation scheme that would force captive shippers to pay more for access to its system .
ferc , in fact , is planning a technical conference next month to discuss the issues raised by el paso 's latest allocation plan .
the concerns of the acc may help shore up the assertions of east - of - california shippers .
most importantly , said the acc , ferc should encourage capacity additions that serve the needs of both existing shippers and expansion shippers .
the complexity of the issues and the potential for inadvertently exacerbating the region 's pipeline capacity problems argues for a careful and thorough approach to the issues , ensuring that customers in arizona , california and elsewhere in the region are well served by any change in the treatment of pipeline capacity in the southwest , " the acc concluded .
the development agreement has been revised since this distribution to add back into the arbitration provision the stipulation that the arbitrators selected by the parties need not be neutral .

to meet tue on gas projects -sources dow jones energy service , 05/14/01 rfid chip will help speed up business
after more than two years of talks , saudi arabia is about to announce its choice of international oil companies for three huge natural - gas projects that will mark a reopening of the kingdom 's energy sector to western investment , a quarter century after it was nationalized .
but the announcement , and the signing of memorandums of understanding early next month , will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for the three ventures , which together will need investment of some $ 25 billion .
we expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at the end of the year , or , hopefully , the first quarter of next year , " said saudi oil minister ali naimi in an interview last week .
this will be a prestigious role in a country that is the world 's largest oil exporter , has more than a quarter of the world 's oil reserves and has the fifth - largest reserves of natural gas .
as with any negotiations for such huge projects , industry rumors abound .
the ghawar project , known as core venture 1 , is projected to require about $ 15 billion in investment .
soon , the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as the roles to be played by national champions aramco and petrochemicals company saudi basic industries corp. ---
the vice president , cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force have solicited ideas behind closed doors , hoping the privacy would encourage a free exchange of ideas .
the way the task force is set up , they do n't have the staff or time to have a huge host of companies come through the door .
weiss countered that the energy task force has collected information from more than 130 groups since january in an " almost herculean effort " to draw input from all sides .
i 'm happy to tell people what we 're advocating for .
one company , ramco energy , dipped in and out very successfully , recently selling its 2 per cent stake in the azerbaijan international oil consortium for dollars 150 m ( pounds 104.8 m ) .
but paladin was last year able to buy petrocanada 's assets in norway , and is this year interested in bidding for some of what the norwegian state is selling off .
by focusing on production , the new companies are more predictable in terms of cash flow and earnings , " says mike wagstaff , venture 's finance director .
vice president dick cheney , cabinet secretaries and others have solicited ideas behind closed doors , hoping the privacy would encourage a free exchange of ideas .
uae 's dolphin may seek new partners if enron exits .
dolphin energy ltd ( del ) may invite new foreign investors to join its project to route qatari gas to the united arab emirates as u.s. enron corp looks set to bow out , industry sources said on monday .
but at the moment we are in the midst of finalising the formal ( development and production sharing ) agreement with qatar which should be done by september at the latest .
uog is to invest $ 2 billion in developing the north field tract , drilling and setting up production facilities .
the anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom 's gas initiative , valued at an initial $ 25 billion , since riyadh unveiled its energy investment opening over two years ago .
but the hard work has yet to start on the opening of saudi arabia 's gas sector , the world 's fourth biggest .
and analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low .
on paper , at least , the kingdom 's domestic gas sector looks set for impressive growth .
saudi aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers , but eventually they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the majors .
jones)- international oil companies vying for a stake in saudi arabia 's downstream gas projects , expect to be notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate , industry sources in the kingdom said monday .
for core venture 1 , the $ 15 billion south ghawar area development .
with all those shortlisted expected to play some role , the immediate and essential question for each of the ioc 's is whether they will be selected to lead and operate a project , with core venture 1 the most sought after , industry sources said .
the operator 's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which will lead to final deals probably by year end .
also , operators are expected to decide and direct how the project 's individual and large components will be developed , details the saudis have n't finalized , sources said .

while generation and transmission can be controlled by the state , there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm .
there are increasing jitters that a slowing us economy could dampen prospects for the global economies .
there are others who hope that better agricultural performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard .
very few economists expect to see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon .
according to our assessment , we believe the indian economy will grow by around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year , " says chetan ahya , vice president at j m morgan stanley securities .
a good crop means that demand for everything , from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like tractors will pick up , " says nagarajan .
economists are hoping that a good monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent .
in service of the economy another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services .
but , it 's performance will be vital to ensure that overall gdp holds at six per cent .
another segment slated to witness good growth will be it - enabled services , says morgan stanley 's ahya .
the telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment .
and there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the gloom over its performance .
a cut could coax the industry to step up activity , though admittedly , much would still depend on rural demand .
foreign institutions support another recent ' feel - good ' sign has been evident in the stock markets too .
with a little help from the rains , india could notch up a growth rate of six per cent .
these are expected to boost the economy 's development , though in the long run .
the recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment , although whether this will translate into fdi flows is arguable .
loop fans can only hope this outrage does n't spread to other agencies .
it would make for some cold winters .

this newly created unit will work within the remit of global risk management operations and will adopt the following core responsibilities in europe .
establish procedures for opening trading support operations offices and create key benchmarks for measuring on - going trading risk controls .
in this role , barry and his team will ensure that all enron operations in europe meet the extremely high standards of trading support we expect throughout our organisation .

currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new environment .
i wanted to make the following points : 1 .
my recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand .
we just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource needs .
louise , i am sorry to bother you at such a critical time , because i know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter .
however , i felt like i had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following .
assuming the goal is to retain key employees for netco , i am not confident these numbers will achieve this .
i have asked them to be patient , not make any quick decisions , and give us a chance to see this through .
the mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end .
i understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available .
but i wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you .
i am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713 - 446 - 9669 .
there is more and more interest amongst our custoemrs in the west in looking at swaps .
i want to be able to show them how the isa contract fits together with the credit support annex and confirmation letter .
can you make a pro forma master and credit support annex so we can fax or e - mail these to potential clients so we can try to get their interest and encourage them to get contracts and credit in place with us ?
i know you are hesitant to do this , but it would help our marketing significantly .
i will need someone to champion things on your end .
good luck and let me know how it goes .
yes still in texas , but thinking about moving back up east to new york .

good morning , just a reminder to get your eia estimates in by 2:00 .
thank you , anthony carroll bnp paribas commodity futures ,
i wanted to let you know that i am extremely concerned about the associate / analyst program , so much so that i feel all the work i have done , and all the time i have spent on the program has had little impact outside wharton / penn recruiting .
in as much as i would like to continue to support the program , i ca n't in its current form , and do n't have time to fix what i thought we had been addressing .
i 'd be very happy to spend a few minutes of your time ( rather than blather on in an email ) to give you both my overview of the program , and suggest changes and improvements .
you mentioned that you could send us a brief report on what has been going on in turkey in the last couple of weeks .

and i do n't think we spend any > more time on it than that .
then follow up to see if we can get these issues resolved .
i hope you can read this ...
andy - would you please review and provide me some initial comments on its > content .
i will call you when i get a chance .
in addition , it would likely be necessary to introduce this concept on a bilateral basis , such that it would also be binding on us in similar circumstances .
however , we may be able to think of some creative way whereby the counterparty is free to deal with us ( and we are free to deal with them ) on an unsecured basis , subject to our standard collateralization requirements , but also provide that upon the occurrence of a particularly serious event , such as a material adverse change , a triggering event , an event of default , etc . , the security automatically takes place .
we would need to consider whether such a " prospective " security interest could be made to work and be enforceable .
would you please let me know whether you think this is a worthwhile project or whether we have considered such a thing in the past in houston .
as noted above , the clause would have to be one that could be " sold " to counterparties and be acceptable to us on a bilateral basis ( and that may well not be possible ) .
if you believe that it is a worthwhile project , i will continue to work with mungo hardwicke - brown to see if we can come up with something .
i must say a really big thank - you for the massive part you have obviously played in getting the opportunity this far .
i think i 'll need a beer tonight .

legal and/or credit should direct you when a division should trade under the legal entity 's master .
tana , i 'm hoping you can clarify some information i received second - hand on cargill , incorporated , and cargill energy , a division of cargill , incorporated .
based on this information , and from previous requests from legal for global contracts to refer any interpretations to legal , the global contracts group could not make any assumptions regarding other counterparties not specifically listed on the contract or schedules .
i wanted to verify if what i had heard about cargill energy , a division of cargill , incorporated , was correct and to obtain the pertinent documentation if so .
i just want to make sure that there are no eol issues in the future and that we have not misinterpreted any information .
as usual , thanks for you help and patience .

i think the idea on grouping a small number of movies to increase liquidity is good but we need to make sure that diversification can still be done through this market .
if enron wants to take some position , i would recommend that we must be diversified enough ( 15 + movies as the consultant said ) .
we could have made the same expected return with a lot less risk by investing in s&p500 . )
but we need to have ( or expected to have ) a significant numbers of similar deals of other movies . )
we could take positions , but initially would try to find the other side of any deal we 'd do .
i think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it .
otherwise , if our forecast is not consistence with the market , we may have an imbalance in the bid - ask orders and we may end up taking some positions .
this way , we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we do n't take any position at all .
using the mark - to - market charge can reduce credit risk .
again i think your idea is very good .
that is , each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt , we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market .
this way , we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money .
in the last paragraph , i think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself ( i.e. , if there are lots of buyers , our offer price should go up . )
we can offer other derivative products such as options as well .
ideally , the monetizers would close when we do .
pacificorp has expressed an interest in staying in as 25 % owner , which should reduce the bridge risk , since we can show the former owner staying in the game .
post - syndication , the new owners can contract directly with an operator .
for tax purposes the owner needs to have some risk .
if we have to indemnify them in this area , we will need to better understand the available insurance products .
we have also developed a list of strong sites that are looking for machines , three of which we control , either through options or marketing agreements .
commercially , the deal makes sense , and i am confident that we can structure around the risks .
the decision we need from senior management is whether this is a game we want to play .
we can put on the position we want by bridging this deal .
we have a chance to move on these machines , but need to make up our mind by the end of this week whether to put resources on it .
i will forward those exhibits to you shortly .
please feel free to call tobyn or me for additional details .
also we will need a counterparty contact .
if you have any further questions , please feel free to give me a shout .
please let me know if you can be available on tuesday , may 15th , 2:00 cst for a conference call re the above - referenced .
once i receive a response from everyone on availability , i will then send out the call in information .

third , owning the nine mile point plants will elevate constellation 's stature , moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the new york market , entergy corp.
another important point is that the constellation nuclear services group , a unit within constellation nuclear , was established when baltimore gas & electric , another constellation energy subsidiary , created a new area for its life - cycle license renewal activities .
thus , constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nuclear - generated power continues to rise , as the company anticipates .
this alone should provide a solid rate of return for constellation 's merchant energy business .
in addition , as i indicated , the new york location is key factor in this deal .
aside from its large population , the state of new york is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently .
for these two reasons alone , new york stands out as the center within constellation 's focus on the northeastern united states .
there is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase , and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market .

please when you know it provide suzanne with the headcount for the confirm / settlements program on may 5th and the global contracts program on may 24th and i will take care of the credit program on may 12th .
rate information not developed - need integration with rate server or mkm , preferably mkm .
need to define how mkm will be used - whether just for index names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well .
therefore , some issues could arise as each development team migrates to the standard .
this needs to happen relatively quickly .
- data for facilities is heavily dependent upon enron global facilities database in current design and functionality - this needs revisiting as the decision surrounding global is made cp_addr_vw - this table references only internal_cp_id and contact_type_cd in conjunction with address_id .

here are some of the things that i would like to do next week : review your action plan to move the close and officialization of london books to same day , - certainly want to review this in detail with you - the issue being that we may not in the short / medium term be able to change systems infrastructure to run same day - but with a combination of process and tactical systems enhancements we may be able to deliver no action p&l , new activity p&l and position signoff on trade date with ' officialisation ' of books on t+1 in time for rac var explain and limit monitoring process
also i would like to go through our credit difficulties with you and ted at same time - more for information on this - because when we ' solve ' market risk reporting issues we will face big push to ' clean ' credit exposure reporting process - office of chair is very insistent on this to replicate , if appropriate , an operational risk information session for london counterparts ( you and i can review early in the week what we are doing here in houston today and modify the info for europe )
would defintely welcome this - i can walk through the european mo issues trying to identify key operational risk themes - top of my list is metals i would like to spend some time on metals with you - hence the lunch on wednesday with andy cornfield and howard carter the two controllers for metals ( brokerage and merchanting )
discuss the doorstep process with you and , if you deem appropriate , your business controllers in the london office who will participate in doorstep reviews this year ( clear up and questions and get your input on how to continually improve the process ) , would like to brainstorm the linkage between control standards reporting , self assessment of op risk and doorstep - this can be done initially in a small group but additionally i believe the business controllers would welcome some more background of why rick , rick and yourself need the process to be successful -

new plants , voltage plan may help reduce blackouts mercury news ,
he further praises calpine 's efforts to build thousands of megawatts ' worth of new power plants , enough to make a significant dent in california 's energy shortage .
although calpine has run into problems in some locations -- including san jose , where opposition arose to its proposed plant in the coyote valley -- it has generally found smooth sailing .
the company also is building a $ 624 million natural gas pipeline into southern california from new mexico in a joint venture with pipeline operator kinder morgan energy partners , a move that could dramatically ease california 's natural gas shortage .
a second phase of the project , to cost $ 1.1 billion , would extend the line into northern california .
we 've been building to this for years .
a consulting firm at first , calpine in 1989 bought its first generator , a tiny geothermal plant in sonoma county , and proceeded to add other small thermal plants throughout northern california .
about that time calpine was making another important decision about its future .
the plant finally won the backing of the city council in early june , but only after state officials indicated they would ok the project regardless of the city 's objections .
cartwright noted that the project won the approval of the sierra club , which argued that newer , cleaner - burning plants should be developed to replace older , dirtier generators .
we think california is a great place to do business .
a federal bankruptcy judge tuesday approved a request by pacific gas and electric co. to spend up to $ 22 million a year on environmental cleanup projects at about 50 sites .
the figure is slightly higher than the utility has spent on average in recent years but much lower than the total $ 307 million cost it has reported to the federal securities and exchange commission .
also , calpine plans to open new power plants near yuba city and pittsburg early next month , adding more than 1,000 megawatts to the grid .
two large power plants that will supply californians with electricity will greatly boost emissions in mexicali and imperial county , a cross - border region already plagued by air quality problems .
we 're not opposed to power plants , but we are concerned about the emission levels and the impact it will have on the health of the citizens of the two areas and the impact it could have on the region 's economic development , " said steve birdsall , a district pollution control officer .
we believe that could be significant , " he said .
joel epstein , an intergen consultant , said the company 's research indicates the emissions wo n't have a significant impact on either side of the border .
epstein would n't reveal details of the initiative but said it " will both improve the emissions profile as well as improve the overall quality of the imperial valley region on both sides of the border .
because of the two plants ' total emission levels , the report says they will have " a far greater negative impact on u.s. and mexican citizens living in the border region than if these plants were constructed a few miles to the north in the united states .
both plants have building and environmental permits from the mexican government and are ready to start construction about a mile apart in colonia progreso on mexicali 's western edge .
together , the plants could provide enough electricity to power about 600,000 homes in california .
the study also did n't include data for two other power plants that could be built in the mexicali area .
edison mission energy is expected to earn about $ 1 million in state incentive awards by finishing the sunrise plant more than a month ahead of schedule .
i guess our learning curve here was that the development of these facilities took longer than we anticipated , but we 'll still have them in september .
when edison first talked about the offering several weeks ago , analysts said it could carry an interest rate of about 10 % .
carrying a standard & poor 's credit rating of bb - minus , the proposed seven - year notes would have an interest rate double what a credit - worthy company would pay for a similar issue .
the union hopes a victory tuesday will build momentum for reorganizing other plants , but they concede it 's a tough fight for plants that were once theirs .
reliant shares fell 5 cents to close at $ 30.50 on the new york stock exchange .
mayor ron gonzales originally argued that the power plant was too close to a neighborhood and to workers at a huge office park that cisco systems is planning to build .
california will try to argue that neither of those factors should influence a settlement .
we think we suffered greatly last summer .
we determined that if the plan had been in effect since may 2000 , that the numbers were approximately $ 9 billion , " kahn said .
wholesale power costs in california were $ 7 billion in 1999 , rose to $ 27 billion last year and could top $ 50 billion this year , according to state estimates .
and new long - term energy contracts may lock california into paying higher - than - market rates for future electricity .
we have no idea what the price of power will be next week or next month or next year .
but the recent rate increase will be needed for years to come to help the state pay off the $ 8 billion it has spent buying power on the wholesale market for the utilities to distribute to their customers , he said .
in addition , the state 's utility companies are negotiating with gov. gray davis for debt relief that , if approved , could cost ratepayers an additional $ 10 billion over the next decade , according to freedman .
although the contracts provide some stability in a volatile situation , it remains to be seen whether or not the governor got a favorable rate .
it may end up being far more expensive than the alternatives available on the market , " said freedman .
it would be like getting a fixed - rate mortgage at the worst possible time .
i would caution folks who think that there 's a trend toward lower prices , " he said .
, mexico will boost emissions in the border region that already has air quality problems , according to a recent report .
the plants , which will be operating in two years , could provide electricity to 600,000 homes in california .
the report said the generators will have " a far greater negative impact on u.s. and mexican citizens living in the border region than if these plants were constructed a few miles to the north in the united states .
but joel epstein , a consultant for intergen , said the company 's research shows the emissions wo n't have a significant impact on either side of the border .
we regret any implication that the commission has already found that the project is needed and any ... confusion this statement may have caused to either the commission or the residents of southwestern riverside county , " nelson wrote .
the judge , who previously expressed doubts about the project , said the letter will be placed in the case file .
it is easier for us to plan and for the state to plan , " he said .
we will re - evaluate it in september .
page?a - 13 new plants , voltage plan may help reduce blackouts posted at 11:32 p.m.
john woolfolk mercury news california 's first major power plant in more than a decade will begin pumping badly needed electricity into the grid today , leading a new wave of generators to ease the state 's energy drought .
` ` it 's very encouraging for us as the operator of the state 's grid to see new generation of this magnitude come online to help manage the shortfalls expected this summer , ' ' said jim detmers , vice president of grid operations at the iso .
edison plans to upgrade the plant to a more efficient , combined - cycle design generating 585 megawatts by the summer of 2003 .
before taking significant action , however , the utilities plan more tests , and are awaiting direction from gov. gray davis , who could make an announcement later this week or early next week , the mercury news has learned .
they also must address the concerns of customers , who may be unfamiliar with the concept and worried it could damage appliances or computers .
changes could begin in the next several weeks and continue into the summer as workers adjust substations statewide , turning down voltages like motorists slightly lifting their foot from the accelerator to save fuel .
for now , supporters say , the idea is one of the more promising ways to help get california through the summer .
` ` it sounds like a good deal to me . '
most appliances are built to operate best at about 115 volts , but can range from 110 to 130 .
` ` the utilities agreed to analyze the test results from the past several weeks and use them to determine on a circuit - by - circuit basis where additional voltage conservation can occur , and then implement that conservation wherever practical , ' ' nelson said .
the puc may debate granting utilities an emergency waiver from the standards that would allow some homes -- particularly in outlying areas at the end of long circuits where voltage tends to drop off slightly -- to receive power as low as 110 volts temporarily , he said .
` ` as long as we keep the voltages above 114 , we can do that .
` ` we are looking for every additional opportunity to squeeze more megawatts from the system . ' '
the tests showed that small changes in voltage would not damage the appliances and could ` ` give the governor the equivalent of a new power plant or two so he could play poker better with these power suppliers , ' ' wattenburg said earlier this month .
` ` we 're glad they are looking into creative solutions .
we are very interested in it and will have an official position in a few days . ' '
now , with the state buying electricity on behalf of utilities , it could take a further blow .
participants stated that the legislature continues to work on a direct access solution that will not interfere with the bond sale and should be allowed to continue its work unimpeded as the bonds to do have to be sold until september .
we are concerned that direct access may be suspended for convenience 's sake - to make the job of taking the bonds to market easier .
but this issue is too important to the long - term solution to california 's energy problems for it to be so summarily dismissed .
john - thanks for the news release - it looks like a good decision ; particularly the discontinuance of goddwill amortization .
given the new expense policy , i wanted to see if you would have any problems with that .
the deals have about $ 1 m value and will be more likely to close in person .
energy users in silicon valley need to get ready with responsive energy installation for the summer of 2001 and beyond .

nelson , jack 's great idol , smote the hated spanish and french at trafalgar in the 18th century long after the armada had been wrecked at the mouth of the thames , an event that shakespeare must have been aware of .
i will not be near trafalgar because we are going to go from madrid to granada to barcelona in a triangle but will at some point be able to gaze out across the mediterranean in the direction of some of those little islands that o'brien mentions
if you could obtain from ted murphy and send me the current risk management policy i would be forever grateful .
, i 'm afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to nelson and the armada .
i 'm pretty sure it 's somewhere between cadiz and gibraltar
i do n't have a current version but will ask ted for one .
trading limits mark , i have n't had a chance to plunge into the book you lent me at the conference because i am flailing around wildly in as much as i can about certain spanish topics before early july , including such things as , of course , cervantes , a man whose mind i have come to love almost as much as shakespeare 's , the catalans , the spanish civil war , the war of spanish succession , the spanish inquisition and of course the spanish aramada .
we will have more information in the morning .
please let us know if you have any questions or initial comments .
i 'll be in touch in the near future to follow up .

hi cate - mike mcconnell has asked me to respond to you on his behalf .
with regard to the focus of your presentation , i have written a suggested session description below for your review .
it reflects a strategic view of enron 's move into online b2b markets , which will be very relevant for our audience of c - level executives from the fortune 1000 .
the audience at the 21st century internet summit will be primarily cios and senior executives from internet companies , so perhaps you could deliver the same presentation with a slightly more technological content and perspective .
the programme for the e - business summit goes to print next week , so please forward me any modifications of the text below by july 19 .
thank you for your interest in this project
and i look forward to seeing you in atlanta .
we are particularly interested in including a presentation on how enron has leveraged core competencies to take on a new role in the internet economy , including the net works initiative to create b2b websites for other businesses and industries .
we would be delighted to have you speak on this subject at either the atlanta or chicago summit .
thank you for your consideration of this invitation and i look forward to following up with you following the holiday weekend .

` ` ferc 's proposal is a good way to start improving the market , ' '
they would be expected to begin collecting more information in california as well if the market requires it , said mark palmer , vice president of communications for houston - based enron corp. , the world 's largest trader of electricity .
southern california edison and pacific gas & electric now want consumers to pay the full cost of those purchases in the form of monthly surcharges over the next five years -- a plan that would push into the distant future any hope that deregulation would bring relief to the high - cost california electricity market .
utilities will argue just as strenuously that to make them absorb the unexpected costs of a vital service is unfair and would impinge on needed investments in electric infrastructure .
in sce 's case , the proposed rate increase would be no more than 10 % , which would add about $ 5.50 to the typical monthly residential bill .
nobody at ferc could be reached for comment .
other changes backed by ferc would allow the three investor - owned utilities to manage risk by allowing long and intermediate - term power supply contracts and would temporarily modify market auction bid processes .

the commission has approved a federal register notice , to be published shortly , that contains a series of questions designed to help gather this information .
the commission will produce a report that discusses the advantages and disadvantages associated with different approaches to particular issues and that identifies , if warranted , areas in which additional federal legislative or regulatory action may be desirable .
recently , however , substantial price increases and reliability problems in some areas undergoing this transition have raised questions about the best way this restructuring can be designed to benefit retail customers .
in addition , the commission has been asked to examine possible jurisdictional limitations on the states ' authority to design successful retail competition plans and whether there is a need for federal legislative or regulatory action .
for the updated report , the commission proposes to examine state plans that allow customers to choose their generation supplier , and state plans with unique approaches to retail electricity competition .
the commission will work with the states to understand the various features of the plans and to gather facts relevant to understanding the market reaction to a particular state 's plan .
the commission is particularly interested in receiving information about the market response to various provisions of state retail competition plans .

i 'm told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly .
unlike our experience in the senate , we have had significant input into the bill in advance , and expect something that we can live with -- and something more reasonable than the mccain bill .
with that said , there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the el paso accident , so we 'll have to see what kind of hand we 're dealt in the next few weeks .
i 'd say that there 's still a chance it may not get done this year .
i 'll have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you .
with all this said , i 'm on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave i 've taken for the birth of our new baby daughter , so i may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week .
also , cynthia is out of the office through the end of the week but will be reachable tomorrow and friday .

if you wish to keep your information private , please do not send requests involving personal information via e - mail for any reason .

you and your management team can begin the process of giving performance reviews to your employees .
i spoke with sheila walton today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting the employee reviews .
she indicated that the target completion date should be the end of july .
i will keep you updated on this as i get direction from him .
in order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid - year review process , we will not share performance clusters with employees when conducting their reviews .
it is very important for all of us to be consistent in this process , so please communicate this to all in your groups who will be giving performance reviews .
clearly , a large number of employees performed at a higher level than those employees in the satisfactory category , so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in the organization , help you achieve the groups goals , etc .
this will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with the relative performance of that employee .
please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team , yourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team , or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback .
i believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations .
i ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment .
thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid - year prc process a meaningful one .
mark has informed me that one of you would handle anything prior to 5/00 on oasis .

i think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined with a project finance discount rate .
illiquidity discount , in my view , should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without sufficient depth .
if we apply an illiquidity correction in this case , we should be consistent and use this approach across the board for all project finance type cases ( not that i recommend this course of action ) .
we can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario ( each scenario will recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world ) .
if we run a sufficient number of scenarios , we shall get a distribution of npv as of today .
sorry for a delay in responding to this question .
could you please ensure that these books are set up the same in grms as in erms .

the enron entities are willing to assist the commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the california electric markets by producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis .
for the enron entities other than portland general , the generation facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available .
nevertheless , portland general proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic transaction documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other enron entities , to the extent relevant .
at that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of portland general generation on the california wholesale market . ]
however , ees can also provide similar electronic transaction data with the proviso that it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number .
christie , thanks for taking initiative on the trip so quickly .
i was greatly impressed with the caliber of the students .
we all thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet with such an incredibly interesting , enthusiastic and intelligent group .
also , i 'll be forwarding the enron information packages to donna piazze for your receipt next week .

thanks again for your enthusiastic interest in enron !

the estate or enron would like the ability to use the applications and systems not only for the management or unwinding of positions and supporting the pipelines but would also need them for the newco or energy business that can grow out of some of the remains in the estate and the ability to sub license the mid and back office applications to a 3rd party that would not compete in trading or marketing , but would use them to build a service company around them that would service gas and power companies in north america .
do you have the training you need for the job you want ?
re : centana hi chris , thank you for the information .
i am no longer looking for assitance in finding an apartment , but thank you for your attempts at contacting me .
now there will be major questions as to who will start the next game at rb for the jaguars if fred taylor is not ready to return from a groin injury after the bye week .
he might draw more defensive attention in the coming weeks , and has never proved he can put up good numbers in the past .
his respectable performance against the eagles ' strong defense should convince many fantasy owners to take a chance on him as a backup .
do n't depend on fiedler for quality fantasy numbers on a weekly basis .
the veteran wideout can not be counted on for reliable fantasy production .
he 'll likely be in the starting lineup , however , and could put up decent numbers against the niners .
he has a great career record against the saints , and most definitely should be in your active lineup this week .
kurt warner , active qb updated 10/05/01 considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis , warner is a a must - start every week .
he could be worth starting as your second or third receiver in a fantasy league .
thanks justy , maybe you can just fax me a copy of your pa or eta , so i can have a copy of the document when i speak to them .
glencore commodities limited hi tana thanks for the note ..... !

as soon as i get his update i will send it .

after reviewing the pre - hearing conference statement , i feel that at this juncture all that may be needed is for tw to enter an appearance .
i do n't believe that we currently have a position as to " whether pg&e 's proposed resolution of the issues raised by parties in their protests is agreeable " such that we could file a statement as the judge has requested .
you may recall that the pg&e filing in october was a request to simply extend their current rates for two additional years for the period of jan. 1 , 2003 through dec. 31 , 2004 .
dan douglas provided us a summary of the filing and my recollection is that after reviewing the filing and his summary we were of the opinion that the rate extension probably would have minimal impact on tw however their reorganization plan to convert their backbone system to an interstate pipeline via a filing at ferc could certainly have an impact .
please send me updates on any current projects , news of any new projects , or let me know if a project has been completed / terminated for the october 5th report .
i appreciate your support in assisting me keep track of our ees / ena government affairs activities .
please let me know if you would like information on a specific project , or a copy of the complete report on a monthly basis .

please advise if your schedule conflicts with this time .
he should depart the us as soon as possible .

i 'll send something to you early next week .
the radio team thanks you for your enthusiasm and dedication to the service .
this relates primarily to pricing of risk management instruments for energy ( an area of some interest to enron ) , but is applicable as well to a variety of other settings .
i know from our discussion that enron is interested in weather derivatives and other exotic options that might apply across several economic sectors .
the work here could inform this context , but it is better thought of as work that would inform risk management within a particular sector ( e.g. , electric power , chemicals , plastics , etc . ) .
it is related to some work that john birge of northwestern has been undertaking , and i understand that some of john 's students may be working for you , so if you know any of these folks , please share it with them .

gerald - i think the doc needs to accomodate the possibility that we may offer several options ( both transport and supply ) before we finalize a structure .
i picked 180 days for the term but it may need to extend for a longer period of time - perhaps 1 year .
i think we need to tailor the presentation and filing to minimize the chance that ferc will take away flexibility
even if the tw approach on unbundled options goes nowhere , several of the strategies we may want to implement next year depend on continued ability to sell embedded options .

please call me at ext . 5 - 7621 if you have any questions .
while i think we should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone , i nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary focal points for those discussions , particularly if you do n't get to this for a few days .
i thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as i was thinking through some of the issues / positions .
also , i 'll have to run down the conflict issue when i get back into the office , but i thought i could generally review the ppa in any event .
in addition , i did not know whether it was ena 's or dynegy 's obligation to work on a response to cms , but i thought it made some sense to see what one might look like on paper .
as noted below , there are some issues underlying this position .
while many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year basis -- which generally supports mplp 's position -- the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies : namely , the stated capacity charge ( on exhibit d ) for " year 1 " only would apply for 3 months , but even more importantly , the capacity charge ( on exhibit d ) for " year 35 " would apply for the last 21 months of the contract term .
my overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly ( described above ) that results by applying exhibit d using a calendar year concept ( i.e. , the 21 month " year 35 " issue ) since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around ..
more before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made , we likely would want to review or undertake , as the case may be , some additional such as ( which i assume we could generally obtain from the michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e - mail you forwarded ) : --the michigan puc presumably approved the ppa ( prior to the first amendment ) in a published order .
( this could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the dispute on the basis that mplp would concede the issue on a prospective basis only ) .
certain points in support of mplp 's position --the definition of " contract capacity factor " provides for a calendar year determination and , most importantly , provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the cod occurs that ends at the end of that calendar year .
( we should discuss with the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be additional support in that respect ) .

in addition , the newly released may revision to the governor 's budget submission confirms the substantial revenue deterioration that is expected to emerge over the next eighteen months due to the weak high technology sector and stock market .
the may revision commences what is likely to be a difficult budget debate .
to date , the state 's general fund cash advances for power purchases total approximately $ 4 billion , and these advances are likely to grow very quickly in the coming months .
moody 's estimates that the state 's ending cash position will be approximately $ 10 billion at june 30 , 2001 , including both general fund cash and internal " borrowable resources " , which represents cash that can be borrowed by the general fund beyond the end of the fiscal year .
as a result , the state 's cash reserves are likely to be significantly depleted by the time long - term financing can be secured .
the experience of the early 1990s indicates that a substantial portion of borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity .
we are currently assuming the state 's general fund may not be fully reimbursed by the proceeds of the long - term financing , as such full reimbursement would reduce the amount of bond proceeds available for future power purchases , and require dwr to seek additional rate increases during 2001 .
based primarily on the downturn in the high technology sector , which relies heavily on options in compensation packages , and the sluggish performance of the stock market and its adverse affect on capital gains , the state has reduced its tax revenue estimate for the upcoming year by approximately $ 5.4 billion , including a $ 2.7 downward revision in the personal income tax .
the drop in these sources of income will also temper growth in sales tax collections for the upcoming year .
the proposed budgetary reductions , along with proposed spending levels for recurring items such as education , will likely lead to prolonged budget debate in the coming weeks .
while such budget negotiations would not necessarily adversely affect the timing of the issuance of the long - term power bonds , delay could further weaken the state 's fiscal position .
the energy crisis will have economic , as well as financial , consequences that add further uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook .
in moody 's view , the forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate the potential impact of these difficult to quantify dimensions of the energy crisis .
at the moment , we expect that the substantial cash resources accumulated by the state of california during the expansion of the last decade , in combination with the planned long - term energy financing will enable it to avert the degree of fiscal damage that would call for the rating to fall to the a range .
while we expect that the state will be able to structure a viable long - term energy financing over the next few months , substantial obstacles must be overcome to meet that goal .
regarding your call , i can make the 8:30 a.m. conference call tomorrow morning on the agency agreement .
i 'm looking forward to speaking with you .
terry , thanks for your reply .

he said he wanted to be able to give the arbs an agreed schedule by the time we have our first call .
i told him there was no way we could do that , because until the arbs resolved the dispute over the scope of the proceeding , i had no way of knowing what kind of discovery i would need .
i told him we would want to depose most witnesses from whom he planned to offer a statement .
that said , i said i saw no problem with witness statements ( thinking that this may be the easiest way to get testimony from rebecca mcdonald , among others ) .
i told him that , to my knowledge , we had not been asked by morris for an initial conference , but that we were ready , willing and able to have one whenever asked .

rob was not planning to be on the call , but i may be able to twist his arm -
susan , just wanted to check to see if anyone has helped you on your livelink issues .
let me know if they have called you or helped you .
rob looks to miss approximately 4 weeks .
chris weinke ( car ) looks as if he will start this week .
steve mcnair ( ten ) will likely get the start , but if he is ineffective could be pulled early .
emmitt smith ( dal ) was able to practice on thursday and is expected to start this weekend .
he has a partially torn acl and is going to miss the rest of the season .
fred taylor ( jac ) was not able to do much in practice and does not look like he will play .
if he does play , it looks as though it will be on a limited basis .
jon witman ( pit ) probably could play this weekend , but may be held out to fully heal .
tyrone davis ( gb ) , who is currently on the pup list , would like to return to the team but that may not happen due to the solid play of bubba franks and david martin .

the decision would have prevented the commission from implementing the legislation that prohibits direct access , at least during the time that legislature and the direct access coalition work together to try to come up with a compromise to continue to allow direct access .
sure would have been nice if the commission had passed it , though .

claudia - thank you so much for responding .
the materials that we are looking for at each office are the following .
the numbers and contact information for each location are below .
with respect to what else we could offer them : from a commercial standpoint , i 'm sure you 're scouring that front , and i may not have much to add .
another commercial angle might be mission energy , but again , not sure how much better mission fares from a credit perspective .
one idea that we 've bounced around that might appeal to edison -- but may or may not be appealing to us
that is , in return for 100 cents on the dollar , we 'd agree to take , for example , a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon .
it might provide a useful template that edison could use with other creditors , and
the " note " angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with fielder .
i hope i could provide you with information sufficient for making the right decision .
but i thought you might find it interesting to see a bit about where we will be sailing .
please be sure to bring it along with you since we will need it if we try and go to any spots we have n't been to before and since it will have the most up to date information on navigation , restaurants , bars , etc .
if you want to focus on just a few , the places we are ( in my humble and easily overridden opinion ) most likely to visit are :
the bight on norman island - deserted island but a floating bar / restaurant , good snorkeling nearby jost van dyke - we have always liked sydney 's peace & love in little harbor and foxy 's in great harbor sandy cay - the classic deserted island , very small - probably just a lunch or quick swim
trellis bay - closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a restaurant called the last resort cooper island - nice quiet resort on the island with a good outdoor dining option
we will need to be sure we are anchored somewhere near tortola ( which probably just means not at the bitter end or on st. john ) the night before your flight so we can make sure you get to the airport .
or we can drop you anywhere else
there 's a phone since there are taxis that can be called and the island just is n't that big - i do n't think it could take more than an hour by car to get from any one spot on the island to any other !
please be sure to use them if you check anything since that will make it much more likely that they will catch up with us some day .
i 'm not sure , but it may also make it just a tad easier to get through bvi customs when they see those familiar tags .
the following servers will be coming down , please click on the icon for more details and scheduled times : system outage notification for : pr1 - apollo production outage start : (
the production sap financials ( pr1 ) system will be out of server to expand disk capacity and improve storage technology .
if the enclosed meets with your approval , please sign the attached and return it to me via fax
if we got this " gift " , it would be nice to be able to sell the ercs we have so that we can reduce our out of pocket exposure during these fun times .
having said all of the above , i have my doubts that something like this would have a chance of working out .
water assembly member tim leslie is interested in sponsoring a bill which would grant air credits to prospective power plant owners in exchange for using reclaimed water .

advanced services oregon companies could get 20 % tax break for building advanced telecom facilities legislators will be considering a bill to set up a 20 % tax credit for any company building advanced telecom facilities that meet certain specifications .
sb 479 would require interested companies to apply to the economic and community development department for certification of their facilities as " advanced telecommunications facilities .
to be eligible for the tax credit , the facilities would have to ( 1 ) be located in an area where the current minimum bandwidth service is n't available to a majority of the customers , ( 2 ) improve access to advanced telecom services for a majority of all customers in unserved or underserved service areas , and ( 3 ) meet performance standards set by the department .
the tax credit could n't exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer and could n't be carried forward to a succeeding tax year .
the commission said it also would open a second proceeding to establish a " fair competition usf .
this second fund would " identify and make explicit any implicit subsidies contained in current rates .
the commission hopes to have the high - cost usf in place by may 30 .
comments on what issues and unes should be addressed in the new docket are due march 5 .
advanced services idaho puc seeks more input on possible fiber route
the second round of comments should address the first round of comments , which were due jan. 31 .

qwest corp. recognizes that the fiber route would be beneficial but questions whether the benefit would be greater if the funds were deposited in the idaho high - cost fund for nonrural companies .
, in the matter of the commission staff 's proposal for installation of a fiber route between riggins and grangeville , idaho ) internet michigan legislation would create ' cybercourt ' a bill introduced in the house would create a " cybercourt " to " allow disputes between business and commercial entities to be resolved with the speed and efficiency required by the information age economy .
the bills would direct the department to establish an academy for the 2001 - 2002 school year that includes 3-year - olds through 12th graders .

thanks , maria i recently discussed above - maximum rate deals with northern 's commercial team and wanted to forward what i shared with them to you .
in other words , we can not unilaterally require a customer to purchase capacity at a rate above the max rate ; however , customers may willingly choose to pay a negotiated rate ( above max rates or below minimum rates ) .
do i have to offer the maximum rate or say this capacity is also available at the maximum rate ?
we do n't have to expressly state the capacity is available at our maximum recourse rate , but if the customer requests to pay the maximum rate , no further conversations about paying a negotiated rate should take place .

monday 's high - range close leaves the door open for additional short covering on tuesday ahead of this week 's api inventory report .
closes above last week 's high crossing at 2.87 would greatly increase the odds that last week 's low marked a double bottom with october 's low .
today 's low - range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on tuesday .
closes below this key support level would open the door for a possible test of august 's reaction low crossing at 268.40 later this year .
however , today 's low - range close leaves the door open for a possible setback on tuesday .
closes above this resistance level would likely trigger additional fund short covering now that this year 's harvest is almost wrapped up .
however , it will take closes above the top of october 's gap crossing at 2.25 1/4 , which coincides with this summer 's downtrend line to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place .
closes above today 's high are needed to open the door for a larger - degree post - harvest rebound that could last into the end of the year .

march needs to close above last week 's high , which coincides with the 25 % retracement level of the may / october decline crossing at 53.04 .
closes below last week 's low at 47.50 would confirm that a short - term top has been posted .
closes below last wednesday 's gap crossing at 726 would increase the odds that a short- term top has likely been posted .
while export demand has been strong with cumulative sales running at 83.3 % of usda 's projection compared with 61.9 % for this time of near , this year 's bumper u.s. crop will continue to limit near - term upside potential in the market .

the results of this study would provide vpa with insight into what steps needed to be taken to meet their long - term goals .
the plan focuses on two ( 2 ) key areas : maximizing existing port - wide cargo handling capabilities and developing new or improved facilities to handle the market needs of the future .
according to the study , vpa has the potential for a possible 250 % increase in containerized cargo ( potential intermodel volume increase of 300 % ) by the year 2010 .
to be capable of handling these potential increases in port capacity , vpa had to take a hard , serious look at its existing facilities .
however , renovation / expansion work would also be taking place at the newport news marine terminal ( nnmt ) and the portsmouth marine terminal ( pmt ) .
all total , vpa is initially looking at over $ 334 million worth of improvements and expansions to help attract the more then 16 million tons of general cargo forecasted for vpa by 2010 .
investments , such as those mentioned above , will ensure that vpa has the capability to maintain their competitive edge for years to come and hopefully allow them to increase their market share by 2010 .

for more than a year viacom has said it was waiting for a recovery in blockbuster 's stock -- long stalled below its offering price -- before it went ahead with previously announced plans to split off the remaining 82.3 % of the publicly traded unit .
blockbuster has been picking up market share and growing the business , " mr. karmazin said , adding that viacom was " very enthusiastic about its future prospects .
viacom 's change of mind is likely to spark speculation that the company will make an offer to buy the 17.7 % of blockbuster stock outstanding that is in the public 's hands , to make it easier to tap the cash now being generated by the chain .
when viacom originally acquired the business in 1994 , it hoped it would be a cash cow that would help pay for the paramount communications acquisition that year .
blockbuster has been able to grab market share , reflecting fading competition from other chains and independent stores .
at the time viacom planned to unload within about a year of the ipo its remaining blockbuster holding by offering viacom shareholders a chance to exchange their shares for stock in the video - rental unit .
business is so strong that blockbuster now is having to deal with a new problem : long check - out lines at stores , where in some cases customers have had to wait for 45 minutes .
but mr. wood has said he believes that the agency needs to do more to ensure well - functioning energy markets in california and other places or risk seeing deregulation fail entirely . '
he also received $ 7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as options for 782,830 shares that could be valued at $ 35 million if enron 's stock appreciated 10 percent annually .
u.s.-based enron corp on wednesday presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) fired power plant in northern japan , aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant in japan .
the move brings enron one step closer to realising its plan to build a power plant with an initial capacity of two million kilowatts in aomori prefecture .
seguchi said , however , that the cost of purchasing land and building lng - related facilities was adding up to more than initial estimates .
the plant , to be built by e power corp - a wholly - owned unit of encom - could eventually expand capacity to 3 - 4 million kilowatts if there is enough demand .
jones)- encom corp. ( japan ) , a new - york based power venture set up by
according to the plan , encom plans to build a gas - turbine combined cycle power plant with an initial capacity of 2,000 megawatts in the mutsu ogawara industrial area in aomori in the northern part of japan 's main island .
construction is scheduled to begin in 2004 , following an environmental assessment and approval from relevant authorities , for commercial operation in 2007 or later .
building a large power plant that is relatively environmentally - friendly in the mutsu ogawara area would contribute to the economy and employment in the prefecture , " governor morio kimura said .
the proposed project would also help lure enterprises of various kinds to set up operations in the area , kimura said in a statement .
encom is considering other sites in japan on which it may build large - scale power plants .
since japan opened the retail power market for large - lot high - volume industrial and commercial users - which represent roughly 30 % of total power demand - to free competition in march 2000 , a number of new entrants have been tapping into the country 's y15 trillion industry .
however , comprehensive pricing and other details of the whole project are n't expected to be finalized for another few weeks .
this is a state which has a reasonably sound record at additional resources mobilisation , but is now facing an unprecedented resource crunch .
sources with financial institutions said that if l&t is finalised as the joint venture partner , it may also be the engineering , procurement , construction contractor .
the company has proposed to make an initial investment of $ 2 million in the new subsidiary which will be increased subsequently .
the company has an installed wind power generator adjacent to its dabhol project in maharashtra which has been continuously gauging the nature of wind and the possibilities of using wind as a perennial source of power in the country .
according to the company 's official website , the western coast of the country has been identified as a possible area of proposed projects .
however , the site map does not have any information on the exact location of the project .
enron wind offers wind turbine technology , skilled project development , creative financing options , accomplished power plant design and engineering , and experienced and responsive support services .
i have sat back looking at what the electrical system has been deregulated to in the last five years .
the public better look at what 's going on real close so they know whom to vote for next election .
in texas , i think we 've got a pretty good system , " skilling said .
skilling said texans are in a much better position and should n't worry that their state 's deregulation would be like the california experience .
just three weeks into advertising for the pilot program , txu has more than 9,000 customers in its service areas interested in other electricity providers - about 10 percent of the total that could switch before jan. 1 .
enron ceo says calif. rate hike will help .
that could mean very high prices .
to date i do n't think anyone has been willing to let prices rise to help balance supply and demand ....
skilling said he expected demand pressure to keep natural gas prices high for several years until demand can be curbed or new production be brought into play , possibly by increasing the import of liquefied natural gas .
building new facilities for shipping liquefied gas , storing it and returning it to gaseous form for burning would be expensive but could be attractive as long as natural gas prices remain above $ 3.50 per thousand cubic feet , he said .
he also received $ 7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as options for 782,830 shares that could be valued at $ 35 million if enron 's stock appreciated 10 percent annually over the life of the options .
london , march 27 ( bloomberg ) -- powergen plc , innogy plc and other large generators will benefit from a new system of trading power in the u.k. , while nuclear and renewable - energy producers may find the rules harder going , analysts and executives said .
as a result , generators able to supply power from different sources are most likely to benefit , analysts said .
in addition , the biggest utilities with excess capacity will also profit from supplying other generators with short - term power -- at high prices -- when they must buy to meet neta obligations .
' british energy plc , the u.k. 's biggest generator , has been looking to diversify its production away from a reliance on nuclear energy .
txu europe also hopes to make money trading electricity contracts , as does enron corp. , the world 's largest energy trader .
` ` we will get more price volatility , but it remains to be seen what neta 's real impact will be . ' '
enron corp. , lucent technologies inc. and other u.s. companies are pressing the export- import bank to let private lenders offer export financing , a system that could provide billions of dollars in additional funding for u.s. sales overseas .

i would like to conclude this project as soon as possible .
our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in q1 2001 .
the actual roll out will happen in phases prior to january so that we begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture , valuation , and the necessary reporting and accounting tools .
by using brian hudson 's it team i can be assured that the global needs are met .
i will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further , todd -------------------
as discussed , the project will have the same project formula as the " thunderball " project with 3 - 6 month deliverables .
also , the need to have co - operative development between houston and london will be established for global roll out of the weather system .
the main focus will be a intranet trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine .
the plan calls for phase i roll out for january 1 , 2001 .
next steps will need to be discuss as soon as possible .
topics that need to be addressed are definition of phase i , joint development between houston and london , and duel development between steve stock 's valuation team and my trading team .

, we are currently in the rac process for dragon , and i understand rac has requested updated curves .
however , you have just provided a new curve for thailand , which , was just provided to us in
may. given the methodolgy you explained earlier , i find it hard to believe we would see such a huge impact ( 35 % decrease on a 25 year pv basis ) on our coco valuation ( thai project ) .
it appears that this thai curve is not using ppp , and i 'm not saying your analysis has to be ppp , but most would expect that given the varying economic environments and market places we deal with , ppp is a widely accepted practice / method , as we can not predict the future .
please provide us a detailed reconcilation among the two curves and the country rational in coming up with the revised curves from 4 months ago .
if you need a hard copy , you should check with twanda .
i told him i would give you guys his number .

ckl - you better buy your family christmas gifts from the dollar store because you need to save your money to pay on the $ 500 bet you made with me the night of val 's wedding in that little bar in natchez , mississippi .
well since ut is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that lsu will not even finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash - or we can work out an installment plan .
it looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the great state of texas always being superior in every facet over

we may just need to put some guidelines in place as to when this is acceptable and when a credit approval is required .
this is more likely to be a problem i would imagine for those transactions where we do not separate the termination and settlement netting concepts within the contract ( see below ) .

as always though we would be available to review provisions or answer any questions regarding enron 's position on trading issues .
additionally , it may be possible that in the future a trading attorney in brazil may be available to handle bolivian issues as well .
though the transactional legal work should remain in argentina , as an exemption , i would suggest to use brazilian resources for " project financeable " gas supply agreements .
in light of the need for my group to focus on making the argentine commercial markets a success and the wholesale groups need to support the projects i would like to propose that all bolivian project related legal work go to john novak 's group and all transactional bolivian legal work ( sales and purchases ) remain in argentina .
i believe this division of responsibilities leverages off everyone expertise and eliminates the bottle necks we are having in argentina regarding the project work .

funding for renewable energy programs increases 5.5 percent in the budget , with significant funding boosts for hydrogen , hydropower , and solar building technology research and development , as well as for programs that encourage renewable energy use on indian reservations and internationally .
in his announcement of the doe budget , secretary of energy spencer abraham specifically noted that the proposed budget will support the president 's commitment to double funding for the weatherization assistance program over the next 10 years , and will provide roughly $ 150 million for freedomcar , which aims to develop the infrastructure and technologies needed for hydrogen - powered fuel - cell vehicles .
both the house and senate will now start working on a series of bills to set a budget and appropriate funds .
for power producers , the budget includes a new 10-percent investment tax credit for qualifying chp systems , an extension of the tax credit for landfill methane power plants , an extension of the production tax credit ( ptc ) through 2005 , and an expansion of the ptc to include more biomass energy facilities .

i feel very sorry for those investors and employees who have been devastated by what has happened .
i would hope you can make the trading business and other companies held by enron what it once was without having to sell off too many of the future profitable ones and make use of the two beautiful buildings now towering over houston 's skyline .
sure they trusted that dynegy would merge , so perhaps their frustration should be aimed at dynegy or perhaps use their collective educated minds together to help find a way to turn enron around and make their investment purposeful rather than throwing stones .
your favorite stores , helpful shopping tools and great gift ideas .
information is still coming in from various sources but i wanted to show you the direction this was taking so you can provide feedback .
i 'm sure you are already seeing these ....... any word from dynegy ?
given the uncertainty of how exactly the two canadian markets that are set to open in 2001 will look , it was determined best to have a minimum of broadly defined products , which will be further defined over time as the markets develop , rather than trying to introduce a large number of complex products that may end up neither applicable nor appropriate and which would only serve to make negotiations of the form with counterpartys more difficult .
i would ask each of you to review the form and provide me with any final comments you may have at your earliest convenience so that enron canada can commence marketing the paper to counterparties .
nevertheless , particularly for rob hemstock and aleck dadson , i do want to ensure that we have not included any provisions that may cause enron canada any concerns in ontario or alberta based upon our current understanding of how those two regulatory regimes will unfold .
thanks for your assistance on this matter and i look forward to any comments you may have on the document .

hi barry , i brought down your tour championship tickets and you were not there .
enron spokeswoman karen denne said it was her understanding that the formal investigation , like the informal inquiry , would be limited to the partnerships .
robert christensen , an analyst with fac equities in new york , said he is concerned the sec could use its subpoena power to start probing enron 's natural gas and trading practices .
gary hoves , an analyst with argus research in new york , said enron 's shares will continue to trade lower on news of the sec inquiry .
we 're doing everything we can to make sure that 's the outcome .
the rating is still two steps above noninvestment grade , but remains on watch for further downgrade .
on wednesday , some energy traders noted that gas and power sometimes traded at prices slightly below the best bid or above the best offer available enrononline , enron 's electronic trading system .
some in the industry have speculated that enrononline volumes may be higher than normal because counterparties are busy flattening their positions with enron due to credit concerns .
energy industry observers have been looking to see if trading would move from enrononline , the electronic trading platform of financially troubled enron corp. ( ene ) to intercontinentalexchange .
neutral exchanges like the new york mercantile exchange or the intercontinentalexchange , known as ice , are expected to benefit .
on tuesday , the new york mercantile exchange - the world 's largest traditional energy exchange - said it would bring clearing services to the over - the - counter market for natural gas derivatives .
ice , which closed a deal this summer to acquire the international petroleum exchange , europe 's largest energy futures market , will soon offer credit guarantees for its oil and natural gas swaps through the london clearing house .
they 're always looking for the best price in the market .
it 's a better way of doing business .
we 're working on additional bank lines of credit to instill greater confidence in both analysts and customers .
ice has yet to see an increase in trading activity as a result of enron 's difficulties , a spokesman for the online exchange said .
- enron corp. on thursday said it gained $ 1 billion in secured credit lines to help support day - to - day trading operations and bolster investor confidence in the beleaguered energy trading giant .
shares of enron continued their freefall , despite the company 's announcement of new credit lines , after the securities and exchange commission said late wednesday it would make an informal inquiry into the company a full - scale investigation .
other see it as a possible buying opportunity .
our decision not to raise our rating when shares dipped below $ 12 reflects concerns that enron 's problems may be affecting their trading operations , " enron said the credit lines will be used to supplement short - term liquidity , refinance maturing obligations and augment the $ 1 billion the company has of cash on hand .
many dealers said they were a bit surprised by the larger - than - expected build in weekly aga inventory data released wednesday .
aga data showed u.s. gas stocks rose last week by 23 bcf , below reuters survey estimates for a 35 - 40 bcf build , and well - below the year - ago gain of 70 bcf and the five - year average injection for this week of 35 bcf .
traders said some in the producing region may have been selling cheaper baseload gas into the spot market to cash in on the steep premium to index .
but some said recent talk about further terror attacks in the u.s. created uncertainty in the market that could limit the selling .
psychological support was seen in the $ 3.00 area , with support also at last week 's low of $ 2.77 and at the trendline in the low-$2.70s .
( adds additional information about rating cut beginning in first paragraph . )
s&p said enron has ` ` adequate ' ' liquidity to see it through ` ` the current period of uncertainty . '
proceeds from the $ 1 billion secured loan will go for debt payments and to supplement cash reserves , enron said .
' still , s&p said , enron 's ` ` financial flexibility has continued to diminish ' ' because of its ` ` inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of enron 's core energy marketing business . ' ' falling below investment grade would trigger early repayment terms for affiliated companies such as the ones created by fastow .
howard meyers , a partner in the new york city - based law firm of meyers & heim and a former staff attorney in the sec 's northeast regional office , said the mclucas - cutler connection could give the appearance of a conflict of interest .
initially , the sec decided to pursue an informal inquiry into related - party transactions involving the company .
any officer that signs off on 10-qs or 10-ks could be liable .
we believe the timing and directional uncertainty of this new development will at best cap enron 's stock price in the mid - teen 's while increasing overall volatility , " eassey wrote in a note to clients .
timing is uncertain , but could feasibly take months .

tom 's sense was that the mandate of the hearing / inquiry would be focused on providing policy makers with a clear understanding of the factors that are producing high energy price levels in alberta and whether there are any policy steps that could / should be taken to address the current price levels .
a few minutes ago tom burns called me back to advise that klein has now decided to delay the release of the new release until at least tomorrow as the tory caucus has a half - day meeting tomorrow morning and the premier wants to discuss how the gov't should approach this issue with members of his caucus before he proceeds with the idea of a hearing / inquiry .

monitor thomas ' progress before you make a final decision on starting a chicago rb this week .
it is unclear whether watters will take back the starting job from shaun alexander , although we think it 's unlikely he will .
updated 12/04/01 poole could miss his second straight game sunday against seattle due to bruised ribs .
he will test the injury at practice on wednesday , so monitor his progress before you make a decision on using him this week .
if you need a tight end for week 13 , cleeland is definitely an option , barring any setbacks .
he continues to be hampered by the injury , and will be evaluated on a day to day basis .
he saw limited playing time , and wo n't make much of an impact from a fantasy perspective .
if you 're in a deeper league and need a wideout , mitchell may be worth taking a chance on .
according to the chicago daily herald , thomas should be back in the starting lineup this weekend .
he 's questionable for sunday 's game at buffalo at this point , but he should be able to play barring any setbacks .
bettis was listed tuesday as doubtful , meaning there is a 25 percent chance he could play .
we 'll see how he is by the end of the week but , by listing him as doubtful , you can see where i 'm heading , " cowher said .
according to the doctor , we 've got a chance with chris this week , " reeves said .
updated 11/29/01 bruce may not be having his best statistical season , but he 's still worth starting on a weekly basis .
however i am sure the interconnect was built larger than required .

lynch could n't be reached for comment , but a spokesman for the governor dismissed campbell 's complaints .
my sense is that people will appreciate having some certainty and being able to plan for it , " said assemblyman fred keeley .
they do n't have to like it , but i think they 'll appreciate it .
as you may know the directors regional prc will be carried out on november 30th in sao paulo .
in that meeting both andrea calo and fabian valle will be represented by john novak , and as you are their supervisor i would appreciate if you can send the consolidated feedback to john before the meeting for him to present to the committee .
i realize the group may go a different way with this , but i remain convinced that we should go to a pure number system ( ie a pure relative ranking ) and use the behaviors and skills descriptions as a way of discussing the differences between people .
the relative ranking lets us have the flexibility to meet business needs by getting tighter or " looser " on performance rankings , terminations , and comp .
instead we will look at making other changes ( for example , reducing the number of clusters from 6 to 5 and/or changing the wording ) at the mid - year 2001 .
the vp prc committee had a chance to look at the revised clusters at last week 's meeting .
cindy has asked me to send them to the executive committee after you have had a chance to review them .
i have as you would expect been following the events of the last few weeks with concern .
hope you all have a happy and healthy holiday season .
according to prepared remarks for a speech to be delivered at a central banking conference at the bank of italy in rome , clementi said the documentation recording transactions in derivatives markets also needs to be improved to avert wider shocks in financial markets .
but these same customers can now take on further exposure to other forms of credit through these new instruments without increasing their borrowing .
he is also worried about how courts in different countries would treat these contracts .
by andrea reierson consolidation in the global banking sector could make it harder to keep swaps the preserve of the otc marketplace and may push them onto a centralised exchange , the bank for international settlements ( bis ) said in its quarterly review .
this increasing concentration of swap books may spark strong pressure for swaps listed on an organised exchange where counterparty risk is taken by the exchange 's clearing house , bis said .
bis also noted the market shift in fixed income benchmarks from government bonds to shorter - term instruments , particularly in the us .
trading in interest rate swaps has risen relative to futures and options trading in treasury notes and bonds with transactions in coupon - bearing us treasuries peaking in 1998 while those in private instruments continue to rise , the bis said .
the continued expansion of the interest rate swaps market also underpinned demand for money market products , typically the most common hedging vehicle for swaps and swaptions .
nevertheless , though the effects of these excesses are likely to continue for much of this year in the form of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings at some of the larger banks , these problems , one hopes , will prove modest both by historical standards and relative to the resources of these institutions .
responses to a request for comment related to the new basel accord and an alternative proposal by the fed that could simplify capital standards for u.s. banks show that most banks prefer the basel accord , he said .
i should emphasize that we are still analyzing your many excellent comments to determine what kind of response we should give .
the possibility of creating a single ' master master ' agreement that covers both physical and financial products was actively discussed , with advocates citing such contracts would improve efficiency by simplifying the negotiation process for market operators .
doubts were expressed by some participants , however , regarding the feasibility of developing a ' master master ' contract , especially concerning administration , legal and negotiation difficulties with cross - affiliate master agreements .
few of the contracts introduced by established marketplaces in recent years have met with an enthusiastic response , and the gains enjoyed by some contracts have largely reflected a reallocation of business away from traditional benchmarks , " said bis economist serge jeanneau in the international body 's quarterly review .
a reallocation of activity also took place in europe in the late 1990s , with eurex capturing business in the long - term segment of the euro yield curve and liffe achieving dominance in the short - term area , " said janneau in the report .
janneau believes the falling number of non - government issues in the near future will lead to exchanges introducing contracts based on corporate and asset - backed securities .
examples of likely future behaviour include the us bond market association 's move last september to develop proposals for a corporate bond futures contract , and cbot 's efforts to introduce mortgage - backed contracts .
dear chris and murray , i would like to recommend the following people to provide feedback for my review : thresa allen bill williams
i just thought he was a high - class , high - quality guy and that he would be a real addition to the staff , " south said .
the groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for san diego gas & electric .
under the consumer groups ' plan , sdg&e would be allowed to keep some of the profits , but it would contribute $ 72 million more than it would under the governor 's plan .
the multibillion - dollar settlement between southern california edison and california regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state .
on his first review of the deal , he thought about $ 1.7 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates .
the clearest - cut customer contribution flows into a $ 3.3 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills , probably through the end of 2003 .
it is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow .
join us for details next week .
we could be toast -- see attached bloomberg .
the company 's securities gained today as talks between enron and dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take place .
the bankers have been seeking additional investments , which would be made in the form of convertible stock , for more than two weeks .
a lower rating would trigger $ 3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships .
i will be up here until i get a new job .
i 'll catch you later and hope that some rest lies in your future .
thanks for thinking of me ( the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages) ...
i 'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend , and that you got a chance to meet my parents .
i 'm going to have to make a trip up to austin soon for a visit to make sure you 're hitting all the must sees / eats .
by the way , how long are you going to be there ?
i hope that you and jen had a safe trip back to houston .
have a great week and hope to catch up soon !

this morning i visited with sudaker rao at the indian embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the goi .
after all , india is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ongc that must be interested in exporting energy services .

everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue .
they may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated .
please review and advise us how we should proceed .

the new york times , 01/03/2002 companies & finance international - enron collapse turns focus on pension rules .
enron corp. it looks like the democrats are going to try to do just that .
the new year at the capitol -- a congressional - election year -- opened yesterday with an announcement from sen. joseph lieberman that the senate governmental affairs committee , which he heads , will hold hearings into enron 's collapse when congress returns to work later this month .
mr. cornyn , like the republican governor , has received more than $ 100,000 in contributions from enron through the years .
in california , meanwhile , democratic gov. gray davis has suggested that enron may have contributed to the energy crisis that struck his state last year .
the subcommittee will spend the next few months gathering and analyzing the documentary trail , and hearings from those subpoenas will be held later in the year , levin said at the news conference .
we 'll do our best to coordinate with our colleagues , " lieberman said .
the problem is there is so much to look at that there may be some pieces not investigated .
in a comment letter , deloitte & touche recommended several changes andersen should undertake but said those items " were not considered to be of sufficient significance to affect the opinion expressed in [ the ] report .
on wednesday , andersen released the results of an independent review that found the company 's work provides " reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards .
the full committee will be looking at what the experts are saying about the collapse and what role various federal agencies had in overseeing enron .
berardino rejected suggestions that fees paid by enron for auditing and consulting may have affected andersen 's work for the houston energy company .
if , as we expect , the transaction does not close before year - end , we will reevaluate the desirability of the transaction based on the then - current circumstances .
lapson applauded mirant 's move to bail out of the deal , saying it will help " bring their resources into balance with the current market situation .
but additional assets sale may prove difficult .
but consumer advocates , while generally agreeing that the texas plan included better safeguards than california 's , expressed skepticism that residential customers would benefit from long - term reductions as energy providers competed for business .
the official start of deregulation in texas was new year 's day , but today was the first business day of operation and , as yet , few of the 4.7 million eligible households had chosen to switch providers away from the longstanding utilities .
and mr. hadley predicted that such appeals would intensify in coming months .
us companies receive generous tax breaks for matching employees ' contributions to retirement plans and using shares makes contributions cheaper .
dallas salisbury , head of the employee benefit research institute , a pension policy group in washington , notes that the defined contribution plans were designed to help workers retire with company stock - not to provide a diversified investment portfolio for retirement .
the new york times page 1 , column 4 c. 2002 new york times company
it 's kind of jelling a little bit -- which is what we were hoping would happen . '
the company 's new charity fund has distributed nearly $ 9 million in gifts -- mr. lutnick and other partners recently offered a $ 5 million matching grant to help the fund raise $ 10 million more -- and cantor has paid roughly $ 45 million in promised bonuses and other benefits to the families since november .
a few weeks ago , i had the incredible pleasure of announcing that espeed would be profitable for the first time , in the fourth quarter of 2001 , ' ' he said .
it is not possible to say how these gains will affect mr. lutnick 's own compensation .
the new suburban office will start with 10 people , but mr. marber hopes it will grow to about 25 if the firm 's stock - trading business continues to thrive .
but i remember thinking , as i picked myself up : ' please , i just want this year to end . ' ''

in response to the " urgent " need for additional gas supplies to serve california 's electric generation markets this summer , kern river gas transmission has announced an emergency open season for 135,000 dth / d firm transportation service expected to be available by july 1 .
they are very interested , and we are very interested to entertain this possibility .
the $ 81 million project would be finalized by april 2 based on whether the necessary permits and licenses for construction have been obtained .
williams could cancel the project if expansion capacity is not fully subscribed .
a portion of the emergency facilities may be incorporated into williams ' 2002 california expansion project , which is currently on file at ferc , or its 2003 new generation expansion project , which recently underwent an open season .
in response to ferc and to the state of california we have located available compression equipment that we could have on site nearly immediately , and we 've come up with a proposal to place those compression units on the very same sites we will be using for our permanent expansions , " said kirk morgan , director of business development for williams gas pipeline west .
these are different units so there are different air quality impacts , but we 're hoping that those sites can be permitted very expeditiously ....
other requirements can be found on the web site at http://www.williams.com or by contacting bev chipman at ( 801)584 - 7048 .

in talking with deseret , they felt that they had a much better chance of pushing a short form isda agreement for this trasaction through the general counsel than they would the long form isda .
that said , i think our best approach is to set up a short form isda agreement for deseret .
as usual , the sooner the better on putting together the short form isda document .
if you have any suggestions , please let me hear from you by mid - day .

jeff , mark elliot in legal here in london is concerned that there may be tax or legal implications depending on how involved in the process london gets .
it would be helpful to mark if you could let him know what the problems you are experiencing with your clearing function are and what exactly london will be doing , this way mark and tax can investigate .
but it might mean that you will have more legal points to finalise .
i tried to contact jeff to get some more information for you
if you could let me now quite swiftly on this issue i would be very grateful as we finalised the legal points on clearing docs a couple of weeks ago
re : documentation from om hi barry , regarding our upcoming pulpex " market maker " role , we 're running into a few problems with the clearing function .
i mentioned to bob that it may make more sense to use one of the existing london office clearing houses .
a new account would be required to separate paper from your other business .
houston office would be responsible for the electronic trading , reporting positions , reconcile trading activity , report profit/(loss ) , etc .
ect pulp & paper would reimburse london office for expenses incurred in connection with support requirements .
maria , would you provide me with a list of the " clearing houses " you use today .
i 'll give this to bob crane to see if he has a preference or other comments .
call or write if you have a chance early next week

if a better understanding of enron 's transactions ( a deal ) that involves enron 's financial as well as commercial participation with another business entity would help you do your job better - this course was designed for you .
the objective of this class is not to teach you how to do a deal , but rather , to help you understand how basic financial principals contribute to the structure of a deal and provide you with insight to enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together .
on another note , i will be send the photos + negatives via fedex today to tracy ralston 's attention .

my concern for this trade was that we brought it to credit 's attention this morning and did not get final word to move the deal to aquilia energy until late in the day ( 4.45pm ) which affects logistics ability to nominate for next day business .

i will inform the ena commercial team that they will need to allocate the total available line with ectric .
though i would appreciate input from legal if we can somehow net vitol s.a. ( swiss ) with its us unit , vitol s.a. inc. under one master and thus set only one , global limit without the need to allocate .
i believe neil is doing the analysis and will input them into cas - credit analysis shortly .

the 120 gpm number is the guarantee from the vendor and at that rate the water quality is better than what we need .

please read so you know what 's going , and can take the lead on implementing these strategies .
thanks , stan due to the relatively weak real - time market during morning hours , we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec .
bidding or buying - back generation that you 've sold forward .
we want to stress that this is a relatively short - term strategy .
we have two strategies that we would like to suggest : 1 .
you are still paid the day - ahead price for the day - ahead quantity , but instead of generating it , you would be buying it from the iso .
in addition to the physical problems this might create , the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow .
this would call for you to reduce your generation , and the energy we buy - back in the real - time market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity .
as in the previous example , if your cost to generate is $ 40 , and you sell day - ahead for $ 50 , you make $ 10/mwh .
if we can buy - back the energy for a price of $ 30 , then you make $ 20/mwh .
you would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced .
also , the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage .
at this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy # 2 , buying - back blocks of energy in the bi - lateral market .
if you have any questions or comments please call myself or chris foster .
thank you for your prompt attention in this matter .

the lower rates will be implemented under kern river 's previously approved extended - term rate program .
williams , which developed a strategy to lower rates in response to customer requests as part of its rate - reduction settlement in 1999 , projects more rate reductions next may , when the costs and revenues of the 2002 expansion are reflected in rates .
the extended - term rate program was designed to provide long - term , firm shippers with an option to pay lower , more market - responsive rates today in return for extending their contract terms , " said kirk morgan , director of business development .
bruce warner , manager of rates and planning for tulsa - based williams , said the company had looked at its " financial situation and found that if customers could live with longer contracts , we could live with lower rates .

both honeywell and united technologies look like irresistible buying opportunities for contrarian investors with a time horizon beyond three years or so .
the stocks got clobbered after sept. 11 because both companies make important components used on commercial aircraft .
from a longer - term perspective , however , demand for aircraft engines and subassemblies should be just dandy .
it 's also important to realize that the commercial market wo n't stay depressed for more than a couple of years .
at a current $ 57 a share , the stock is trading at less than 16 times next year 's earnings , which are projected to be down slightly from this year 's results .
bossidy is making tough restructuring moves that are hurting current results but will leave honeywell even better positioned for the next upturn in aerospace , which accounts for 40 percent of honeywell 's sales and an even larger percentage of earnings .
my work was always appreciated including by visiting audit teams from houston .
i request the above complaint may be investigated by your high office including an opportunity to me to plead my case as requested herein above following the concept of natural justice .
for future reference on the long term deal .

i was n't put on as a reviewer for mike neves , but i wanted to tell you what a good job he has been doing for our group .
during the past year we have had two major projects going on with respect to the databases our group uses .
first , we have had a major upgrade to an existing database , the master swap agreement database ( now called the financial trading agreements database ) .
this upgrade including adding a number of new items within the database , as well as creating security on some of the confidential legal data maintained in the database , so the database could be opened company wide , while maintaining the secure legal information .
second , in response to the online trading system , we needed to immediately create a database to keep track of the legal department 's approvals of the online counterparties .
this need for this database came on quickly ( as has everything associated with online trading ! ) , and having that data available enabled us to quickly respond to our client , the online trading group .
mike has done a wonderful job both upgrading our existing database and helping create the new online database .
his quick turnaround , understanding of our needs , attention to detail ( while at the same time remaining cheerful while we , as i 'm sure other groups pressed him with deadlines ) has helped us meet the needs of our clients .
mike continues to give us prompt attention when needed , and he is certainly a valuable asset to your team !
and we can work around that if you were planning on going .
he started by talking about the edison mou , which he said will be assigned to the senate utility committee for review , the judiciary committee will look at the legal elements , and the natural resources committee will look at issues surrounding easements .
a larger infusion of cash from edison 's parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component .

pg&e bankruptcy keeley 's collective " plan b " sources report that additional details for the plan b have just been ironed out on the assembly side .
the assembly is working to announce a plan " as soon as possible " ; this announcement could come this afternoon .
this dedicated rate component would apply more to " high - end customers .
note , sources report that at this time , a dedicated rate component for socal to pay for power going forward is not included in the plan b that will be announced .
the assembly is not certain whether this additional dedicated rate component will be needed .
by 2003 and 2004 , enough additional generation should be online that power prices should be low .
finally , business customers ( including those that would have to pay the dedicated rate component ) would have the right to apply for direct access to power .
if this plan is passed , ( better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier ) the constitutional challenge from michael sturmwasser is still likely to go forward .

so they may have to upgrade their current network from 10/100 base - t to a fiber network capable of supporting 1 g bit / sec traffic as well as scale to 10 g bit / sec when that is available .
this is important for reducing interoperability issues that can arise .

stan 's day just opened up for this thursday the 4th , or we could do 2:30 to 5:00pm on monday , october 29 , or 2:30 to 5:00pm on tuesday , october 30 .
before considering the future landscape , it is worth reviewing the various phases of the market during the last few years .
nevertheless , despite the lack of highly leveraged structures , companies throughout the region continued to fund long - term local currency investments with shorter term foreign currency (
corporate credit quality is slowly improving and a recent trend has been the increasing use of derivatives by financial institutions - particularly local banks and fund managers .
this is expected to continue as more active portfolio management leads to a focus on yield enhancement and credit risk management .
the emergence of domestic bond markets is having a positive impact on market development , both directly and indirectly .
there is a direct impact where bond issues are swapped into a different currency ( in the case of foreign issuers accessing a market ) , or interest rate ( where issuers wish to alter the interest rate basis ) .
additionally , the increased availability of instruments in the market and greater demand for product from investors is leading to new local currency products , such as options on domestic interest rates and securities .
this in turn requires further regulatory consideration , which has generally been in line with international standards .
going forward , it is reasonable to expect a mend towards regulatory harmonization and increasing adoption of international regulatory standards .
there has been continual progress as the number of users increases , more products become available and regulations put in place to allow healthy market development .
nevertheless , the derivatives markets in asia will continue to develop and mature as end - users grow in number and sophistication , while the range of products continues to expand .
but with the forthcoming fourth financial markets enhancement act there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
it is , however , widely expected - or at least hoped - that the forthcoming fourth financial markets enhancement act will include the introduction of a statutory definition of borsentermingeschafte .
its conceptual scope is controvasial3 and the continuous development of new types of transactions requires a provision which is as comprehensive as possible .
but the meager contribution provided by equity markets masked an impressive 28 per cent increase on volumes from levels last year , and a 14 per cent increase in exchange traded options .
use of forward rate agreements more than doubled during the year to $ 1 trillion making it the fastest growing market segment for the year .
` ` the interest rate market was more volatile this year than last and that means there was greater underlying customer demand for interest rate hedging , ' ' said mr. farrow .
` ` the market has advanced considerably .
bankers who have worked closely with the basle committee on banking supervision say it is likely to recommend three different options for banking supervisors : basic indicators ( that is , a single proxy for the entire bank , such as trading volumes ) ; a business line approach using committee - imposed capital ratio ; or thirdly , internal measurement using a bank 's own loss data within a supervisory specified framework .
the implication is that further and more detailed work on the internal measurement approach may result an the development of appropriate models and a fourth regulatory option , based on internal modelling .
the principal message to regulators is that larger banks with good operational risk measurement and management should achieve lower capital charges .
joseph sabitini , managing director in the corporate risk management group at jp morgan in new york , recognises that a new regulatory framework for operational risk must accommodate banks at all levels of sophistication in terms of risk measurement and management , but that it also includes a risk - based option for " those with the appropriate capability " .
stages three and four move on to using technology for the measurement and management of those risks within a firm .
we have also looked at a number of quantification techniques , but believe their effectiveness will depend on the quality and quantity of the data available .
according to tony peccia , vice - president in the operational risk management division at cibc world markets in toronto , most banks would want to be at the internal measurement stage of the proposed capital charge when implemented - which is dependent on internal data .
the more consortium has agreed to begin sharing data from november 1 2000 and receive the first batch of scrubbed , anonymous data by the end of the year .
the paper highlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach could enable institutions with poor operational risk management processes and controls , but with access to internal loss event data , to achieve a lower capital charge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but no access to internal loss event data .
the paper also highlights fears over the method of calculation of operational risk capital for an institution that has recently experienced serious loss , but where management has reacted and strengthened the control environment in that area , and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence .
the paper argues blat there is strong support in the industry for a regulatory capital assessment model that allows institutions managing operational risk to effectively access a more precise means of calculating an operational risk capital charge - institutions should benefit from more sophisticated controls and the regulatory regime should establish incentives to improve risk management and controls .
insurance and risk transfer will become an important and sophisticated component in an operational risk manager 's tool - box over the next few years .
although some products on the market will provide immediate liquidity to a bank following a disaster , there may be certain arguments after the event .
rachlin also highlights reputational issues : " while insurance may cover the short - term financial impact for some events the longer term reputation impact can be of greater concern .
insurance will play a role as an instrument for managing operational risk , but not in its current form .... we are waiting for the regulators .
victor dowd , an associate involved with operational risk capital charge discussion at the uk 's financial services authority agrees that further and more detailed work on the internal measurement approach may result in the development of appropriate models .

i 'll see if i can get someone to come up and copy this stuff for me .
please read and be prepared to discuss at tomorrow 's task force meeting .
( paul is scheduled to speak to us to help us make a decision .
you may remember in the beginning of this project we discussed piloting autonomy or an unstructured data management tool in order to reach qualitative and quantitative information .
further , we discussed the value in finding a product which could help us identify experts within enron .
however , only 50 % of those interviewed suggested they would tag email for others to search regardless if it could help identify experts .
but , over 90 % of those surveyed agreed an enterprise search engine would be useful .
autonomy provides some feature / functionality to search email ( the full extent of which will be evaluated by the sst ) .
are we prepared to invest in a much more expensive search engine with categorization feature / functionality which may provide a more robust search platform of the future or should we decide to invest in the best value for our current needs ?
this distinction was arrived at after reviewing the characteristics described in the charter and associated survey as to what was meant by an unstructured data management tool .
to stay within the time frame of the overall project , the scope of the search tool evaluation will focus on these three vendors .
we need more direction from the project sponsors as to what priority to place on categorization functionality .
if it is considered a priority then we also need end user groups with specific problems identified that , if solved , could effectively evaluate the tool and justify any additional costs .
but , i think secretly she was looking forward to seeing her friends .

enron can offer customers only as much bandwidth as they need -- and on short notice .
if successful , enron says , the business could prove to be a gold mine .
the global broadband market will expand to as much as $ 388 billion in 2005 from $ 155 billion in 2001 , skilling says , and he estimates it could generate $ 1 billion in annual operating profits in five years .
enron officials spoke of the water business in much the same way they now talk about broadband : it 's a fragmented international market worth $ 300 billion a year , and enron could extend its expertise to this business and win a huge share of that market .
` ` i think our legacy will be that we proved you can build a business on intellectual capital , not physical assets . ' ' a self - described business history buff , skilling argues that the era of corporate success based on gathering assets is over .
when enron created its broadband business , for example , it moved 60 people -- mainly from enron 's energy - trading units -- into the new division in the space of a week .
` ` we have a marketplace now that can provide virtual integration , getting all those components quicker and cheaper .

scottish power has held talks with enron about buying its oregon- based power utility portland general , which industry sources said would be a good geographic fit for the group 's existing us arm , pacificorp .
analysts said the wide range was due to scottish power 's decision last year to move to a different accounting system , and consequent disagreement over how much tax the company will report .
those interviewed said they are hoping for a progress report on the status of the utah - based hunter power plant , owned by scottish power 's pacificorp unit , which has been out of operation since november at a cost of $ 1 million a day .
we have n't had very much news flow , and we want to know what 's happening with hunter .

furthermore , the potential for weakness in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001 .
at some point such a development would have a price supportive effect .
the downward pressure results from the prospect of a larger - than - usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 3.0 mbd - with a cut in opec output .
cera estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small , on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mbd .
in cera 's view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases , this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years , and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition .
supply trends non - opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0.9 mbd over a year earlier at 46.4 mbd .
we can discuss this further on monday .

the firm said it plans to continue with the fund at an undetermined point in the future and expects that its committed limited partners will continue with the firm .
we 're working through the issues with scott and hope to come to a conclusion on the best course of action in the next few weeks .
however , clark county has been found to contribute to nonattainment in other areas ( it is an upwind contributor ) and as a result there are special permitting requirements in this area .
this condition puts a burden on the applicant of demonstrating that the benefits of the project will greatly outweigh any costs imposed by the project ( including environmental costs ) .
we 've heard from a locat permitter that obtaining offsets would be difficult and that a recent exchange of offsets took place at $ 10,000 per ton .
a 500 mw combined cycle would probably require around 185 tons of offsets or more depending on the specifics .

agave energy co. - met with agave this week to discuss potential atoka lateral expansion projects and other efforts to bring more producer gas to tw 's west texas lateral .
in addition , ngpl called to set up a meeting next week to look at bringing more gas to us on a firm basis in eddy county ; there may be some overlapping volume with agave here .
although i prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons , the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the east in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market , we may have settle for a limited lmp , in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion , but proxy buses are created in zones ( 3 - 5 per rto ) for purposes of real - time energy markets .
our views , i believe , are still very much aligned , however , i need to make some progress on the creation of real time energy markets .
i hope this clarifies any misunderstanding .

my understanding from the india cfo ( in response to my query about approvals necessary for any sell - down like we are working on for dabhol ) is that it depends to whom we sell .
a senior trader for a u.s. reinsurance firm in new york , who declined to be named , believes for the foreseeable future insurers will focus on selling credit derivatives to acquire assets rather than buying to them offset liability .
we have seen enquiry from insurers to buy credit protection and that has grown in the last year .
given the significant increase in defaults over the last few months that are out of line with historical experience , the insurers who are comfortable with statistics and mortality are getting a bit concerned , " he said .
as for insurers ' overall use of credit derivatives , he said , " i would n't say they are significant but they are getting to be more important .

more detailed reports can be found on our client link website .
impact on manhattan office reits - could see as much as 25 million sqft of downtown office impacted - companies with major office exposure in nyc brookfield properties has the most significant downtown office exposure ; boston properties , equity office , sl green and vornado have most assets in midtown .
- suburban office companies may see increased demand reckson and mack - cali have the most significant new york metro suburban office exposure ; consequently our rating on cli is under review .
it is logical to expect that new york domicile companies will have higher exposure .
- we are waiting on additional information before adjusting estimates industry fundamentals will likely come under pressure , and estimates will fall materially for several companies .
the housing markets benefit from secular drivers that should help withstand potential impact of the wtc attack on consumer confidence or economic growth .
- patience may still be required in the credit card sector while we 're encouraged by the slowdown in consumer credit growth , we feel it is too early to bet on a turn in the credit cycle .
- providing some perspective on this week 's tragedy details are still coming in , but in the near - term we expect reduced capacity and higher volatility in the brokerage sector .
- near - term tug of war is likely key issues are the unsettled global markets , partially offset by the potential for additional central bank liquidity .
separately , infrastructure and operational issues will make things " choppy " at best .
we think so , but we acknowledge a backlash towards global connectivity could slow capital flows , expansion , and consolidation .
- strong companies will recoup losses through higher rates being adequately capitalized , companies with strong claims - paying ratings will be well - positioned to write profitable business at much higher rates in 2002 .
- investors should try not to overreact when the market opens , we would not sell into panic , and for stocks that you otherwise want to own , we would add on weakness .
to prepare ourselves for all potential outcomes , we conducted a valuation sensitivity analysis showing what levels the stocks should be considered oversold , fairly valued , and over valued .
with little move , we 'd likely be sellers .
electric utilities / unregulated power defensive ports in a storm - electric power stocks should benefit from ' flight to quality ' we expect regulated and unregulated / integrated groups to perform well relative to the market when trading resumes , as investors rotate into defensive stocks .
we would also be buyers of highly liquid , solid , well - diversified integrated utilities .
- unregulateds inherently defensive & may benefit from greater volatility little exposure to consumer confidence as primary end market of electricity sales are highly stable and resistant to economic cycles .
for the near term we see incremental risk for the september quarter since software companies tend to close most of the deals in the last ten days of the quarter .
longer term , these events underscore the need for backup and recovery software and veritas would likely see some benefit over time as well as oracle who 's database has built in features for replication and hot backup capabilities ( in conjunction with veritas ) .
reliability and recovery issues will become more important items on the checklist as will consulting services .
- oracle will go forward with its earnings release this evening after the close of the market .
i 'm watching for some good vacation days , also ...
as you suggested the other day , we have tried to incorporate the important language of ena 's master firm purchase / sale into the red - lined draft so that it will be easier to evaluate .
we would be happy to have a quick conversation with you to explain ena 's draft agreement and to answer any questions that you may have on the proposal .
please note that ena does not approach enron 's upper management and board of directors for their approval of new proposals until a bit later in the typical bid process .
should ena make the " next cut " , this process would have to be completed prior to any execution of edfi 's agreements .
want to avoid pre - packaged p.r . put - offs , i prefer an open give & take session w/ them and the community in one room .

vasant , it seems we have to help them .
can kate help on this project ?
i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals .
previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags .
unfortunately , the group had a rough p&l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof .
from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers / fundamentals .
as was suggested yesterday during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component ( e.g. , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point -- we could then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors ( e.g. , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research .
mark , can you email me or fax me any written documentation we have give to heidi in regard to performance .
have you heard anything from the hr lawyers regarding our ability to fire her in the near future for poor performance ?

we will begin with the march invoices which will be going out shortly .

someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the doe / dod electric load at kirtland had a fairly high load factor .

john , how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a way that we could provide it to dennis langley ?
if we pull the plug on the project , i 'd like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our information on why the turbines we would use ca n't provide acceptable economics .
i do n't expect that we 'd want to disclose the swap value analysis in steve 's memo , however .
thanks again , and i 'd appreciate anyone 's reaction to the above questions .
transmission constraints could create market value in albuquerque that does not exist at four corners .
given the number of power- critical industries in the area , we could look at siting several remote units at different locations in the city .
existing generation already provides ample baseload supply , however , the production of peak and intermediate energy is not necessarily well suited to existing units .
we should also explore the ability to schedule load .
if the doe wants to peak for a test , would it be willing or able to schedule a test for the off - peak hours ?
under those circumstances , we might be able to cut them a break on power and provide reliability of supply .
in order to match these outputs as closely as possible with available equipment , i made the following selections : case 1 equipment 3 x ge lm 2500
i wanted to get your thoughts on articulating the hr risk management area .

have not had a chance to do anything further on the bullet issue .
i 'll work on it today !
i imagine you may have already taken care of this , but just in case , here is the original email i sent you , with the eta and pa from last night pasted in : louise , as discussed , there are a few items for which we will need the approval of the new buyer as soon as possible , in order to ensure we are able to proceed with a relaunch of enrononline ( netcoonline ) without delay .
two of the items for which we need approval as soon as possible are the password application ( pa ) and electronic trading agreement ( eta ) , which work together to provide electronic trading access to the products available on netcoonline .
we will send copies of the pa to likely customers of netcoonline before we launch the site .
customers will specify their initial password in the pa and must change it in the first log - in session .
upon receipt of signed pa , netco will under normal circumstances enable the master user passwords within 24 hours for pre - approved customers .
the eta states that all trades done via netcoonline will be governed by the general terms and conditions ( gtcs ) posted online for a particular product , unless there is a master or any other agreement between netco and the counterparty in place .
customers must accept the terms of the relevant gtc online in order to proceed with a transaction , unless the company has a master agreement in place with netco .
i 'm looking forward to the challenge !
i 'm sure you 'll do a great job , and hope you enjoy your expanded opportunities .
if you need any additional information , please feel free to call .

i would like to walk through each process tomorrow and make sure that everyone understands their roles .
in addition , i feel that everyone needs to understand how to do the other persons job .
i know in some cases this will be harder for some than others .
however , i do expect everyone to know how the scheduling process works and if needed how they can back fill .

securitization might be the perfect win - win solution .

here i 'm attaching the presentation about securitization for you to use it as you wish .
, i will no longer be able to submit application access requests for you .
until now , i have submitted e - requests on your behalf , and i feel that removing myself from this process will help to reduce turn - around times on your requests , as they will no longer have to come through me .
below , i have included detailed instructions on how to submit an e - request for the financial trading agreements database .
going forward , i would be glad to assist you if you have any questions ( on the system and on submitting e - requests ) .
sorry for any inconvenience this may cause .
if this is correct , could you please forward you spreadsheet with the details ?
if you need a copy of the egan statement with this , please let me know , so i can forward a copy to you or whomever may need it .
my daughter said thank you for her candy and pumpkins .
vince - would you have any interest in this candidate ?
probably a bit to techy for me but maybe a good fit for vince kaminski in houston research .
he is looking to move into more of a quantitative role which will utilise his developing skills and also his statistical and theoretical knowledge as well .
the issue is that he is based in chicago and i wondered if there would be any interest from your headquarters there .
i would greatly appreciate your replying to this email to let us know whether you intend to be a party to these agreements at this time .
we need to be forecasting $ 1 mm under plan for the whole of energy ops for the year .
if you want to sit down for a few minutes and discuss , i am happy to do it .
at a minimum , i would like to review what you have down for us before it is final .
2001 forecast we are in the process of looking at the expenses and allocations to other business units that we are expecting for each of enw 's groups for the remainder of the year .
stacey , based on jeremy 's responses below , looks like we can use an alternative interest rate curve and keep the usd without system changes .
let 's assume the following : postid currency - usd postid otc int type crv - alternative arg interest rate curve deal currency - usd deal level interest curve - alternative arg interest rate curve results : the portcalc would be valued using the alternative arg interest rate curve .
with an output currency code of " usd " , and your deals are booked in tagg to " aa int " for int ( interest rate curve ) , then portcalc will use the interest rate curve you specify in your postid .
these 2 books do satisfy the above requirements , so if you specify an alternate interest rate curve in your postid , portcalc will pv with that curve .
due to the high probability that the argentine peso and the usd will not continue to be linked 1 to 1 , we need to begin valuing the portfolios using an argentina interest rate curve .
and i recall that you thought it would require system changes .
at this time we need to be able to specify usd but pv at an alternative curve .
another option i though about was possibly adding a new currency called argusd and having it use the alternative interest rate curve .
can you please look into the status of the execution on our end so that we can begin tracking in cr ag and margin accordingly if need be .
we are really looking forward to our visit and especially to see sam ! !
if you need to contact hotwire customer care , please have your itinerary number available .

dutch : look at this and see if it is a newsletter that you think any of y all would be interested in receiving .
considering the rapid pace at which we are executing documents , it would be very helpful for us if we could resume distribution .
cynthia , sorry about the way i left last night , but i needed to leave abruptly or i felt i would have lost it even more .
i wish i could throw everything i have into a relationship with you , but right now there is just too much anger , mistrust , and hurt in my emotions to allow that .
i fear i am making a big mistake , because i know you wo n't be available long .
cynthia , when we were together on that trip , i felt a lightness that i have n't felt in a long time .
but i know it will be different now .
please know that i do have genuine feelings for you

southwest airlines e - mail update for may 15 , 2001
ken , we are working with a team that is building ethanol plants throughout the southeast and the midwest , and we are in the process of arranging the right capital partner as well as identifying the right strategic partner for that endeavor .
sorry to keep you in suspense !
i thought i would pass this along .. just in case .
henry groppe founding partner groppe , long & littell oil , u.s. policy , and the middle east henry groppe is a partner and founder in 1955 of groppe , long & littell , a houston based consulting form providing long term forecasting , planning and development for the energy industry .
with the u.s. dollar weaking over the last month vs. most major currencies , and forecasts for it to continue to do so , ( which is clearly helpful to enron while we try to sell international assets ) , i was wondering if we should think about selling some long dated ( 6 month - to 1 year depending on when we think we could actually sell something )
we delivered a draft to our trader on 2/7/00 and i believe that you also received a copy .
we would need to re - evaluate given the lapse of time since the prior draft .
also to inquire if there is anything else you may need as part of your eveluation .
hi jon , i guess it is n't critical that we see whether the trades are a buy or a sell .
the reason that i had requested this was to ensure that i has both sides of the trade but in your case you may be long or short depending on the circumstance .
therefore , if you could just include the enron trades so that we have an accruate picture of the volume traded by enron that would fulfill our needs for the pie charts .
i understand your concern regarding your position and do not necessarily need this information if there is another way to get to the place we need to be with the pie chart .
if you have any further concerns please call me on wednesday to discuss .
thursday 16 nov in sf eric letke would like to meet with your group to discuss support for the san diego team .
at your earliest convenience , please email me a copy of the following :
thank you very much for your kind understanding .
i do look forward to receiving your materials .
doug , here are some contacts that i could think of .
hi jamie , tried to call you today to keep in touch but the phone just rang .
with them getting out of international infrastructure it is time to move on .
i am also working to put a database together so we can monitor what contract online we have .
( this new copy is a long - term one similar to the short - term contract we had in december ) .
i am trying to develop similar guidelines for the southern cone regions ( first argentina ) and thought your expertise would be very helpful .
could you send me a set ?
i 'm leaving for sao paulo on saturday but i will be in the office tomorrow .
as per my voice mail , i 'm planning to set up the conference call for wednesday morning .
i will send the demo to milbank , canadian and japanese counsel for them to review in conjunction with their research for us .
from our preliminary advice , i believe that we will need to structure the game similar to the format in the demo to avoid liability in various jurisdictions for violating trademark restrictions on the use of the terms olympics , sydney 2000 and the like .
we will be able to offer the games to most us residents as well as those european residents for which we received the green light during the euro2000 research .
we should also be able to offer the game to japanese residents so long as the prize has a value no greater than 100,000 yen .
we will not be able to offer the game to residents of australia or singapore ( see david minn 's e - mail below re australia ) .
if we try to structure the game so that it complies with australian law , it appears that we will still be required to seek a permit to offer a game such as this ( notwithstanding the olympics issue ) in australia .
can you talk to your commercial guys to determine how many australian eol cps we currently have and whether it is worth the expenditure of the resources necessary to obtain a permit to make this game available to those cps .
the distribution of prizes through chance triggers the requirement for a licence .
there is zero chance of us getting approval to use sydney olympic names and images .
: i certainly appreciate your very prompt feedback on this issue .
enron employees will be permitted to participate although there may be restrictions placed on their ability to win prizes .
if it will be necessary to obtain a permit , we would like to proceed as quickly as possible in trying to obtain one .
names and symbols , we would like to proceed as quickly as possible to obtain a license to use the names .
it appears to be an excellent marketing strategy the caution displayed in researching the law in various jurisdictions is justified .
if this correct then we will need a license .
i should be able to confirm this later today .
japan will also have some issues relating to gaming which i am sure anne at b&m will be able to advise on .
australia i need to know if these jurisdictions impose any restrictions on such a game .
the game will be launched during the first week of september , so your prompt response will be most appreciated .
thank you in advance for your assistance in this matter .
could you please take me off the calgary distribution list .
mr. hyvl , i just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed a couple of items : 1 .
since we do not know at this time what the purchase order number will be , could we delete this .
attached for your review , please find initial drafts of the following documents in connection with the above - referenced transactions :
we will update these throughout the day .
many thanks for agreeing to take the remainder of the var seminar - it is a great help .
but he said that you would be a bigger draw and perhaps better placed .
to this end , i am hoping that you would consider chairing day one 's plenary session and trading stream .
you can blame raymond for recommending you !
i appreciate that this is asking even more of you than you originally signed up for but you seem to be famous in this small market and it would be great if you could do it .
i apologise for imposing once again but look forward to hearing back from you when you get a chance .
and she indicated you wanted an update on my progress for cl matters .
as i completed this late last week and then was called out of town , i have not had the opportunity to fully review it ; however , it will give you the direction i am heading .
if we use the eol gtc 's , we will have to modify them to be applicable to cl , a process that can be accomplished .
- i am still not sure how we need to handle the additional terms and conditions that are necessary for certain products .
we could leave them in the annex and merely indicate that anyone dealing with products in the classes for which additional terms are attached to the annex would be subject to those terms by accepting the annex ; however , this would make the annex quite long .
please let me know if you should need anything else at this time .
i hope to make that short and sweet and be back here as soon as i can .
so i should be able to make the meeting at 4:00 .
jennifer : hope the london trip is going well !
thanks for the suggestion below which was perfect .
mr. thompson called yesterday to confirm that he would be working with me to schedule a conference call with the two kinko 's contacts early next week .
i 'm glad i came in last friday to send out those e - mails to him .
kinko 's had expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to it in the spring 2001 time frame .
kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for ip transit capacity .
storage - as the hubs and branch numbers grow , there may be a need for managed storage .
collocation - there is a substantial opportunity for enron to provide the actual space to be used for the hubs , as well as the ip transport from the hubs .
interactive video - enron 's ipnet connect product will allow high quality h.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768k. utilizing the enron ipnet connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be significantly reduced , and allow much higher video quality .
ward , we currently re - running the may figures with the updated wind speed correction and will forward the may summary with the jan and feb figures from rich .
if we re - run them it will take most of the day , and we may have them for the morning meeting .
and we 'll work on this .
we should be able to provide you with the curtailment numbers by the end of today based on our proposed methodology .
i think this would allow for more imput from cps regarding the calculation of these numbers and future curtailment numbers .
hi vijay have nt spoken to you in the last couple of months .
- i tried hard calling you but could not get through your number .
i am hoping next time i could visit you all in daman .
place these dates on your calendar now so you wo n't miss out on some wonderful opportunities .
i will get another room for you .
i am sorry to ask for a change on this reservation , but a colleague just > mentioned he wanted to get a separate room , so could we have two rooms non > smoking with double beds , i realize this may increase the rate .
john , great to hear that you are still doing the lord 's work on this case !
good luck on this one and please let me know how it turns out
i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner , at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points : 1 .
the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods , both prior to and after october 2 . 3 .
the scope of the hearing has not been determined , but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology .
please prepare a fed ex package to go out tonight , as described below .
and if he has no further changes we can get the documents signed .
also , if you will send the fuel cell document to swanita_99 , i will make sure i download it and review before seeing jerry tomorrow night .
i 'll let you know if anything interesting happens at the mark bar or on channel 35 ( got ta ' love pbs ) .
we 've made alot of progress this week and we should be able to work quickly through the few remaining issues early next week .
regarding the h1250 swaps that are to be written today , please note that the swap group will not be reviewing the underlying asset for confidentiality or securities issues etc .
hope i captured it all correctly - please feel free to make changes liberally . ? ?
sheryl : i think i mentioned to those on the call that the dec 27 call would be a placeholder for a meeting just in
case we need to have a discussion regarding the pge plan , ferc developments or the px plan , all of which will probably have developments over the next few days .
therefore , i propose to leave the scheduled call for 12/27 in place for the moment , with the hope that we can cancel it or limit it to a short call .
i am pleased to note that our calls have gotten shorter , and we have scheduled separate calls from time to time to discuss individual topics when necessary .
i am sure that everyone is busy and brings up items to discuss during the committee meetings only when they think they are important enough to take up the time of the full committee .
at our next meeting , i will propose to schedule the regular calls two weeks apart , with the understanding that we can schedule more frequent meetings when necessary .
before meeting with glen to discuss this further , i want to make sure that enron does not have any objections .
if i were to serve on the board of quicksilver , i expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which i would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board .
i am scheduled to meet with glen and others at quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility .
paul , i 've put out a request to some of them to get together and will follow up .
i think we need to get with some of the other , more sane members of the muni community .
working with ecm and rarc on enron field parking garage project .
we have kicked off the design team to finish construction documents , having shut down work for last 6 months , in order to meet our proposed may 1st construction start .
however we will review next year once enron center 's new garage is complete and we find that demand for reserved allen center garage spaces is not strong .
if this is case , they can have spaces through 5 year balance of their sublease - regardless of enron 's ownership position with azurix .
azurix definitely does not want to take a partial ownership position in any planes but is asking to continue the " time sharing " relationship in which we can only recover 30 - 40 % of our gross cost , depending on plane used .
he said enron should either already have the payment or should be getting it soon .
ecc has an isda master with transalta , but i think it is a different transalta entity .
please review the below and let us know how you want to proceed .
i 'm passing this on to you for handling .
in any event , after considering the time and effort involved ( noting insight usually requires some form of paper to be prepared ) , any potential value , the commercial requirement for our resources , and after discussing it with milnthorp , i decided not to get involved .
if we think it is worthwhile i am open to persuausion .
hope you had a nice weekend p
tana , just to help you out , i did a quick review of the work queue and there are only a few pending for us .
wow , you have been busy !

if there is , you will research whether there was any evidence of actual purchase activity under any of these meters .
with regard to the zapata county contracts in the new global system , which shows all ena - related purchase , sale or transportation contracts from 1999 forward , you will research the contracts that do appear to show ena as a counter - party for actual purchase activity and at what meters .
also , since the report you drew up does not show meter numbers , you will drill down for those as well , and see if there are any meters in addition to those shown in the pcs synergi document .
would like to talk how we proceed .
we are developing an estimate of the processing costs for ect .

below , i would leave this blank for the moment and add in a later draft .

i should be grateful if you would provide us with details of the date of the first trade for each counterparty where enroncredit.com limited has an existing trading relationship with the counterparty .

( 3 ) ideas for new applications to help speed up the process , etc .
debra bailey is going to start listing projects for the 24 hour group , soon .
see if you can open the attachment ...
this sounds like a good idea .
the central points that i believe i would make include the following , among others .
capital costs , having been sunk , can not affect short run pricing ; the differing engineering efficiencies of generating units will be reflected in their market values , and thus the opportunity cost of production .
more efficient units will have lower fuel costs ( for example ) , but higher opportunity costs for employment of the capital assets .
anyway , i 'd like to prepare such a report .
an effort to measure marginal cost correctly would be a good deal more involved and time - consuming , and my sense is that at this stage a refutation is more important .
if it is a two - week project , then i think that $ 15,000 would be reasonable .

after a string of weaker - than - expected economic data , friday 's employment report came in stronger than expected .
on the surface , this suggests strength in the economy ; however , the drop was caused by a decline in the number of people looking for jobs .
* net net , we will see a very positive outlook for jackup oriented companies .
we continue to forecast a long cycle , with strong utilization and rising day rates over the next three or more years and highly attractive valuations .
* as near term business signals are mixed and stocks remain volatile , we 're taking a 12 month view that trends for ems in 02 will be improve significantly .
while we could see further weakness in share prices near term , investors will want to position themselves for the eventual rebound , and calling the bottom has been very difficult .
from a micro sense we believe top - tier ems cos could achieve 20 % top and bottom line growth in 02 , y / y , from new outsourcing wins .
design wins are positioning altera well for a recovery when the inventory is gone but the bigger question is how long will that take and what is the slope of that recovery .
demand during the summer will determine the direction of the next estimate change .
in our view , some of these stocks have begun to discount a fundamental recovery that is not yet fully substantiated by market conditions ; however , the intermediate - term outlook has become somewhat more favorable and ( perhaps more importantly ) current valuations of certain stocks in our coverage universe still leave room for incremental upside appreciation potential over the next year or more , particularly after the modest pull - back that the group experienced over the last week and a half .
we believe that the spx and ndx will build a base with interest rate cuts .
while we believe the company continues to effectively manage its business and have a high level of confidence in ceo paul charron , we recognize that the uncertainty in senior management is unsettling and believe the clarification of the situation could be a catalyst for the shares .
visibility at the company remains good , with backlog continuing to exceed one q of revenue .
everything is fine although i am really looking forward to spending more time out of the house .
i think that bill and i need some space as well .
i am a little frustrated with the schedule that we are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach normalcy in a few weeks .
please mark your calendar for that sunday as i think that we will have something at the house
and i very much want you and ric to come and meet everyone .
hopefully , in a few weeks i acn make some type of proposal to mark but it is too soon now to do so
and i 'm not sure that i could fit it in .
alos , mark mentioned that i should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that i apparently received recently .

pogo 's well will be spud in december with an expected 60 day drill & completion time .
they have an optimistic expectation of the production being close to the eog well - current initial production of 14 mmcf / d , and have plans for additional drilling in the field area .
however , they have indicated a probable second raton expansion project will be announced march 2001 and have suggested that looping of this southern line could be a possible outcome of the project which would provide incremental delivery capacity to transwestern above the current 40 mmcf / d level .
obtaining approval of even a few simple changes i could recommend to the policy ( applicable only to transwestern , not nng ) would have an immediate effect of simplying the officer approval process and would expedite the turn - around time .
a clearer understanding of what the compact is and is not has been reached with kofi annan 's office ( detailed below ) .
please find below communications between the icc and the un that explain , in the clearest terms yet available , what would be expected of companies under the global compact .

i asked the secretary general 's office in new york when i visited last week to clarify this , and below is the message received from his office .
we all feel it is important to keep the global compact initiative on the right track .
we believe that demonstrating progress ahead of the forthcoming millennium assembly in early september is crucial for the viability of the concept of the compact .
we are very pleased that the president of the icc has already accepted to actively participate .
we are yet to hear further from d&b on what data they can provide , with regard to aggregate bankruptcy rate .
i have suggested to use overall mean of the respective variable for now .

with about 145 lawyers in houston , if it were a private firm it would have been the city 's sixth - largest , according to the chronicle 100 survey released in may. energy trader enron 's internal law office has burgeoned along with the huge trading firm , now set to merge with a smaller but stronger local competitor , dynegy .
in the houston market , where big - firm first - year lawyers start at around $ 110,000 a year , the advantages of going to an expanding company like enron were the stock options and the opportunity to grow with the company .
several houston - based law firms said they have recruited a slightly larger starting class of lawyers for 2002 , meaning they do n't expect to scale back their business in the immediate future .
i 'll let you know when i talk with mark , which should be early next week upon his return from london .
during the past year , upon request , i have worked on employment agreements for all of these entities .
here is the message i had sent earlier this evening : i hope to be e - mailing to you shortly a clean copy of the abb transformer purchase and sale agreement , as well as a blackline showing the changes made from the westdeutschelb agreement dated july 14 , 2000 .

i hope to have these remedied shortly .

although shawn made an offer to michelle some time ago , there was a long lead time for her arrival .
since she started a couple of weeks ago , wes and i have asked her to look into several specific findings from the most aa internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some solutions to issues that were raised .
after shawn and i meet ( see below ) , i will briefly summarize for you the roles that all groups will play in the doorstep review process .
before we move forward i want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose , methodology , participants and execution plan for this on - going project .
i am asking via this note for my assistant to set up a meeting for the two of us to spend some time reviewing the timeline , methodology , and the involvement of rac , andersen , operations and your team .
i will be working the week between christmas and new year 's , so if you are in the office we can plan on getting together that week .
hello all , i would greatly appreciate it if you could take 30 minutes out of your busy schedule to inform our marketing agency d'arcy , who we have on retainer , about your view of enron and the direction your business is moving .
while this wo n't encompass specific marketing initiatives for your group , it will help with projects like the annual report and corp marketing .
please let me know when you would be able to speak with him .
we want to work around your schedule , so please reply to mireya olsen so she can set up the calls .
although i would be comfortable to leave the workload division up to you , i would like to suggest the following ( bearing in mind that there is never a clear understanding about " where you draw the line " ) :
also , both of you should be involved in energy finance as i believe such deals would arise from wholesale and retail origination transactions .
in short , both of you would do legal support to " origination " , however , andrea would focus on trading and fabian would concentrate in ees type of deals .
in addition , fabian would manage luiz watanabe 's workload in argentina , but i would leave this to luiz to structure and implement .
kindly let me know if my thoughts make sense to you and please return to me with your comments asap .
as a final note , please be advised that our baby should arrive on thursday , july 23 .

as previously noted in 5.03 , company should have the option to provide alternative surety - as referenced in the term sheet .
as the new bc energy strategy further develops , we will provide a more detailed follow - up reports .
however , he reportedly may be planning to split the energy and mines portfolio off from northern development , forming two separate positions .
it is also possible that energy and mines could be combined with other positions to form a larger natural resources portfolio .
not sure if we had room in the 12 open positions or if we were able to add headcount at this point ( i believe we added an admin spot in legal ) .

at the same time , ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation .
massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the industry to better predict commission actions .
like commissioner breathitt , massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants to point to other factors when concentration appears too high .
in sum , he averred that the order will provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into consideration the rapid changes in the industry .
because the rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to preserve competition .
hebert faulted the commission for squandering an opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls .
hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack of the iso 's progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted .

thanks for all your help , and have a great weekend !
hopefully , this will take care of this .
as mark mentioned , i would recommend edward barker .
i also would n't be concerned about whether ca is relevant - it is a major issue here and on the continent as the eu states begin to look at security of supply and how they can avoid " doing a california " .
based on the exchange of correspondence below , i will get back to ian fletcher and ask for edward 's cv etc and indicate that we would be prepared to consider a role in san francisco ( with some flexibility ) .
please confirm that you are happy for me to progress this further with the dti .
you should also ask ian for a copy of his cv .
i 'd like to see his resume .
i do n't know that california work will be particularly informative -- given the uniqueness of that great state , but we no doubt can find a use for his skills .
i would want to see his cv .
however , the travel could be 3 - 4 days a week --
they want a relevant job / work experience for him .
i think it would be good for enron ( paul d. may have views on this ) , not only for endearing enron to key relationships at dti , but exposing a uk civil servant to the transparency of our regulation , us - style , can not hurt either , as that is something paul is on a long march to improve in the uk .
i would think challenging research , attendance at settlement conferences , some memo writing , etc . would be sufficient ( actually , that would be a bit below the policy - formation role he now occupies ) , but do you have any thoughts ?
i can get his cv when you need it .
scott , structuring got back to us with some issues we need to clarify to get the pricing from a trader .
capacity - will calpine be able to get manufacturer 's guarantee for net capacity ( or can we re - sell turbines to third party ? )

i understand that the hedge will be structured as a price return swap and the initial equity notional amount of the swap will be based on the book value of the equity interest .
it would be helpful to see the latest financial statements showing that book value .
we will also need to investigate whether any contractual or other legal restrictions may affect our ability to enter into these hedges .
i 'll be reviewing this with sara later today and will supplement this email as necessary .

i came up with a new idea of eog to make their life easier and the ministry was interested : the director general of hydrocarbons is the " regulatory agency " that is interfering in more than regulating the production sharing contracts ( pscs ) .

is it fair to suggest that langdon was brought on board by el paso simply for name recognition and the possibility that he may have some positive , collateral impact on the commission 's ultimate decision in this case ?
his final report to wise wo n't be ready for several weeks , but langdon shared some of his initial thoughts and findings .
langdon has been looking hard at the circumstances surrounding the operation of three southern california gas co. storage facilities - the montebello and aliso canyon fields in los angeles county and the la goleta field in santa barbara county .
but ferc " historically has been a very record - oriented tribunal , " and " in this case , the record looks very sound , " he said .

unfortunately , given the weaknesses in the statute , the transmission rate increase impact will depend on how the icc rules on our motion to dismiss in the comed rate case .

from a procedural standpoint , we have intervened in this case at ferc and are expecting and order in the next month setting forth the procedural schedule , so there is time to decide what we want to do and develop a strategy .

epsa needs feedback on cal and alliance filings and what position epsa can take .
two issues arose on the weekly conference call today on which we need your assistance and feedback .
please let us know how you would like epsa to proceed .
the filing retains a transco structure , with a 5 percent ownership limitation for individual market participants and a 15 percent ownership limitation on each class of market participants .
while the geographic scope is unchanged , the scope will be larger than any operating rto .
with this latest filing it may be appropriate for epsa to intervene , raising issues of support or opposition to the filing .
to determine how to proceed , however , we need input from those companies that have been more closely involved in the development of the alliance .
please let us know how epsa should proceed with respect to this latest filing .

casey was a first - round draft choice and shaun would have been if he had been healthy .
on special teams , he cited the departure of kris stockton , who handled all the kicking duties last season , and said developing a good kicking game will be a key to having a succesfful season .
tubbs had 5.5 sacks and 10 other tackles for losses and showed great promise for the future .
he and most of the other defensive tackles are smaller and quicker than hampton and rogers , which should help the front four show a lot of improvement in pass rushing .
the tackles this year wo n't be as good against the run as hampton and rogers , who were run - stoppers deluxe , but they will be pretty good at it , and , lets face it , the best teams on the ut regular - season schedule are geared to passing .
but let 's hope some of the walk - on kickers the ut staff rounded up after the spring problems surfaced can kick field goals .
if they ca n't , and if this team is as good as it has a chance to be , brown could find himself in the same boat as florida state coach bobby bowden , who lost a couple of national championships in the 1990s because he did n't have guys who could make a chip - shot field goal when the game was on the line .
i 'll report on them in depth in my next newsletter .
they are supposed to be pretty good , and they will need to be .
brown said the longhorns will have more experience this year and that will help the team .
brown says he is n't going to get caught up in pre - season hype this year because it does n't make sense to try to predict how a team will do when it has n't even started practicing .
the doctors told me i could start working out again in three or four weeks
and , if i miss any games , it should n't be more than the first one or two .
the longhorns were already thin at defensive end , and they could be critically short if mcclintock is out for a significant period of time .
he did a tremendous job making the transition to defensive end ( from linebacker ) in the spring and is a guy we have high hopes for this season .
he said he wanted to go to a school where he has a better chance to log some playing time .
if the injury does cost mcclintock significant playing time , the coaches will make some moves to provide more depth .
incoming freshman eric hall , who had been ticketed forfullback , would be a good candidate for a switch to defensive end .
but we 've got to do a better job day to day and week to week .
if benson lives up to all the hype and if none of the other tailbacks emerge quickly , i think he 'll play and play a lot early in the season .
we were just checking to see if you are back and ready to go to georgetown .
hope you trip was a success .
we will be back next saturday .
all communication going forward are to go through me , and i will make the decision as to who needs to be in to the process .

bob - we may want to consider an informal meeting with the cftc staff to get their suggestions on how best to clarify this issue .
bill has asked if we want him to research legislative history or approach the staff directly
these are not ideal solutions , but they are the best i can think of , especially given that the ag group would like to roll out softs products on eol in the next couple of months or so .
; i think your analysis is well - reasoned .
like you , i can not find a definition of agricultural commodity , although the term is used elsewhere , see sec .
for those transactions that will be traded with eligible commercial entities on an electronic trading facility under subsection ( 3 ) , there is a notice requirement .
therefore if enron wishes to conduct such business , a good way to raise the issue with the cftc would be to prepare such a notice and then provide it to the staff for prior review .
absent a cftc regulation , which may not come for some time , the best way to deal with the issue as definitively as possible would be to raise it with the staff directly .
otherwise we could do more research to see if there is any legislative history to shed light on the issue .
please let us know if you want us either to approach the staff or research the legislative history ( to the extent it is available ) .
thanks vince - i 'll give him a try .

as a practical matter , i believe that it will be difficult to maintain an updated inventory of confidential information on an ongoing basis .
i do agree that we need to put some protocols in place with regard to how enron handles different levels of confidential information ( including trade secrets ) .
for example , trading positions and curves would have one standard for access and disclosure , while personnel information would have a different one .
the benefit to this approach is that we can set the guidelines and manage on a periodic basis to make sure that they are followed , rather than create updated inventories .
i would not view this type of approach as requiring much , if any , assistance from outside counsel .

i am happy that you are tony 's friend , and it was a great pleasure for me to get to know you also .

he warned that you will need to confirm whether they still do residential .
i also think this is a great idea - there would be a tremendous benefit if the eei contract became the standard for on - line trading platforms .
i would fully support and provide any assistance to pursue this idea with and through eei .
another " group " to which i believe that we should emphasize our marketing efforts includes the online trading platforms .
in fact , according to published sources , houston street , redmeteor , and others have been working with others for several months on developing industry standards .
this draft only addresses eei transactions , but could easily be expanded to transactions under other master agreements .
randy osteen & i plan to meet next w/ week to start planning the workshop in atlanta we plan to hold at the end of january .
if anyone has ideas for the program please let us know .
we would like to shorten our meeting to two days .

i think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work , an answer in the faq section , a line for the ' failed transaction ' screen and a script for the help desk .
i 'm thinking of something to the effect of : once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty , that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order .
sorry , but for headcount purposes , please let me know if you " will " be attending the dinner via e - mail .
they again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station .
since they could deliver volume back to mustang which could then flow to nng or epng -- this might relieve the volume in the hobbs system where other producers could increase their volumes .
sherry has visited with matt chance , dynegy , along with debra tower , scheduler who monitors the volumes at warren eunice ( poi # 6751 ) .
i am not sure this is the best structure for effectuating this transaction and would like your thoughts .

good luck in the new rotation .
happy new year jeff , it was a pleasure seeing you at the ena party earlier this month .
thank you for your help and advice with regards to my new rotation .
i am enjoying the new work immensely and have the opportunity to review all sort of new technologies and business plans .
we recently came up with the idea of creating a separate program aimed at the big energy companies in houston whereby the generation of new ideas and technologies aimed at the energy industry could be outsourced to the houston technology center and therefore benefit from a level of freedom and flexibility that is difficult to achieve within the hierarchical structures of most big energy players in town .
i assume that enron would not be particularly interested given its own internal entrepreneurial spirit although it could benefit from the exposure to such new ventures and potentially find candidates with technologies it might want to invest in .
this idea was just recently floated and no real steps have been taken in any direction which is why i am wondering if i can ask you for your opinion .
please let me know of any questions you might have and have a wonderful holiday .
again thank you and my best wishes for the new year massimo

vector delay confirms market 's suspicions future shippers on the new chicago - to - dawn vector pipeline had their fears confirmed tuesday when pipeline officials announced that the start - up date for the project , which was scheduled for nov. 1 to coincide with the start - up of the long - awaited alliance pipeline , would be delayed until dec. 1 .
vector officials blamed the delay on the excessive rainfall that has hampered construction of the pipeline , which --- when completed --- would provide initial takeaway for about 700 mmcf / d of the 1.3 bcf / d of western canadian gas that will be shipped to the chicago market by alliance .
alliance officials noted the line has connections with existing pipelines and ldcs serving the chicago hub that could pick up the slack between oct. 31 and dec. 1 .
we do n't think [ there will be ] much effect at all .
we have been working closely with vector .
that is contradictory to what you would think would occur , said a chicago trader for a large marketing company .
you would think that with the excess gas on the market starting nov 1 , the basis would have come off .
the only thing i can think is that people are betting on cold weather showing up in the chicago market on nov. 1 as well .
the vector pipeline would transport much of the alliance gas from the market hub in chicago to the hub at dawn , on , as well as provide access to markets and storage in the upper midwest .
the line eventually will carry 1 bcf / d , but its initial start - up delivery capacity will be 700 mmcf / d .
shippers were notified of the delay along with the rest of the market tuesday , although many already had suspected the pipeline would n't be able to adhere to its scheduled start - up date .
the dec. 1 start - up date includes adequate time for any further weather impacts and for the extensive commissioning and testing programs necessary , it said , adding vector is scheduled to begin filling the system in late october to complete the commissioning of facilities .
for instance , geof suggested some changes to the design last friday .
the suggestion requires some re - work on the user interface and some changes in the daily risk management process .

sally , could you please give me a call regarding our discussion about the above .
based on conversations with bob wason and cathey baker on the sec staff , we believe that this approach could be approved by delegated authority .
it is unclear how good these numbers are .
in other matters , the sec staff has indicated that it would give " credit " toward equity capitalization if the company has executed definitive agreements for sale of the subject assets , such as the sierra water business and its generation assets .
it is important to know when such sales may be announced so that we can factor them into our calculations .
assuming that sierra can establish , based on these types of definitive agreements , that the merged company will be at 28.5 % ( once the underlying sales close ) and nevada has indicated that it will withdraw its intervention and oregon has indicated that it will approve the merger , we would be in a position to meet with the sec staff and ask for a year - end order based on our ability to settle with the california intervenors .
this tremendous accomplishment is due to several factors including the success of the tw commercial team in fully subscribing all capacity including daily firm and lft ( there is no more space ! ) .
in addition , the significant effort put forth by market services , gas control , facility planning and operations to identify all capacity and make it flow should be recognized .
thanks for a job well done and supporting the team effort !

direct cp issuance new product lets issuers build real - time market picture by susan kelly last december , julie nickoley , senior manager of commercial paper operations at daimlerchrysler , agreed to work with prescient markets to develop a web - based subscription technology service to help companies price and manage their commercial paper issuance .

cp rates and what investors are looking for in the market on a real - time basis .
trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into funding desk , and prescient says it is working on a link with bloomberg that will bring in data on trades done on bloomberg 's cp platform .
but given the ease of electronic issuance and the support available on funding desk , paulhac expects more companies will move toward direct issuance via the web .

this is just a short update on the conference call just completed with michael adewumi of penn state , concerning the pcb pipeline modeling project proposed for the transwestern mainline system .
he felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline segement selected for the study ( between c / s 4 and c / s3 ) this information could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected .
david roensch and i will be available to feed technical and operational information to adewumi for his modeling input .
it may also be in the best interest of this project to see a team of technical and operational experts from enron and transwestern begin a brain stroming of this project during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning trials , both of the pipeline system and the c / s piping .
by working through the process , we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns and increase the cleaning success .
although transwestern has been involved in this type of cleaning for a number of years , based upon the liquids data results , the system has met with variable success .
the more technical and operational information we can incorporate into the model , the better will be the modeling conclusions and results of the cleaning activity .
group , when entering a physical annuity ( for example , for the sale of st - cali length in sp-15 ) , we need to make that the annuity starts and ends for 2 days from now , for 1 mw , for he 1 , for the appropriate dollar amount .
i would like to observe this 2 day difference on every annuity that we make .
extra comments in the comment sections can only help .
let me know if you have any questions and/or if you would like a different format or need additional information listed .
we will post the capacity for five business days ( ending monday 03/26 at 5 pm ) because the replacing contract is for term greater than 1 year .
if other shippers come in with a request during the 5 posting days , capacity will need to be prorated or allocated in a lottery .
this may be an opportunity for transwestern to indirectly have an option on storage or for mavrix to directly lease storage .
socal gas believes it can have the new facilities in place within 8 - 10 months .
tw will continue discussions with socal gas to identify additional projects to further increase take - away capacity beyond the 50 mmcf / d contemplated in this first expansion .
the changes would enable high pressure field gas to avoid being compressed into the low pressure side of the atoka lateral .
they are sending us an updated system map to see if any asset synergies exist .
we told them we would keep them updated as our expansion conversations with socal progress .
if we have the new contract in hand , i can enter the new contract & hopefully move these deals over ( the ones for which gas has not yet flowed ) - - - - - - we can split & move any deals for which gas is currently flowing - - - - - -
- we will need the confirm group to reconfirm .

chip schneider and i have agreed that this approach allows us to get to ntp on the project ( up until august 20 ) , or determine a higher - valued use for the turbine in the event the development does not get finalized for some reason .
i am highly confident that this will result in a 2001 gain of $ 15mm-$20mm .
for information purposes i am attaching a spreadsheet showing what the potential value of this transaction may be given various terms and volumes .
given the scenario outlined in the recent draft decision from the cpuc regarding back payments , there may be an oportunity on behald of the qfs to negotiate a modified agreement with dispatch in return for relief on payables by the ious .
the structure is the same as we tried 4 years ago with no success .
at the time , we were going to shut down the qf and pay them more pv than they would have gotten by running , the " grease " coming from the relatively high o&m , which could be extinguished with the proposed structure .
this structure sounds like a strict option , but should still work great .
i could call him for you .
for that right , enron would be able to pay for / absorb most of the past due receivables owed to the qf .
we could not do this for the whole qf group , but we could do it for 500mw+ , which could save everyone $ 200mm+ in past due receivables .

i am sure this will be discussed at length at the next intrastate pipeline association meeting on june 22 ( to be hosted by redmond at enron's / hpl 's offices ) .
if this version passes , you will have one additional year to apply for a voluntary emissions reduction permit ( verp ) .
note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly cindy morphew of txoga and celina romero of atingp - that it looks as though we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted without having to use today 's bact .
if that attempt is successful , the opportunity to apply for a verp will be gone on september 1 .
i am not certain how long this opportunity will continue to exist .
in addition , i 've appended some information on 10-year old bact for gas - fired ic engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to get a verp now .
if while processing the application , the commission determines that additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on the application , the commission may request the information and set a reasonable deadline for a response .
the commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site .
the commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than in other areas , but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate may be required in any area .
because control technology for nox emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited , it is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit system at this time .
i believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the trncc will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for 10-year bact for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the verp program .
grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review .
grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram range may be permittable under a verp if there is test data to validate the old ( pre - modification ) and new ( post - modification ) emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved .
also needed would be a representation of the cost of the controls and even though additional modifications are available , the additional cost is prohibitive .
i hope all of this is helpful .
if you need another copy please let me know .
, you asked for an example of what we would consider " significant emission reductions " that would be acceptable in a case - by - case review when the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level could not be achieved .
also needed in the case - by - case review would be a representation of what the cost of the controls would be with a discussion of why the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level could not be achieved .
this may be due to technical limitations such as no additional controls or modifications are possible , or you may identify cost in dollars per ton of nox controlled to show that even though additional modifications are available , the cost is prohibitive .
after my first read , it looks pretty good .
at that time older rich burn engines could have been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g / hp - hr limit for nox .
the 10 year old bact review on these engines and turbines will have to be done on a case - by - case basis just as we would have done 10 years ago .
we hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they will be able to either exempt or permit under the verp program and submit their letters of intent to participate in the verp program by december 7 , 2000 .
for each engine or turbine , please submit a , table 29 or 31 as applicable , and other technical information that will support the standard exemption claim .
for engines that will be authorized by a verp permit , please identify each engine by unit number , epn , air quality account number , and plant name , and provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a result of participation in the verp program .
when the verp applications are submitted , information should be provided to show that nox emissions will be in the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr range .
information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved , even when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g / hp - hr can not be met , will be helpful in staff review of the application .
we appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the verp program a success .
it has some good background on the firm .

the san diego and cpuc data requests were for november - december , 2000 and january - april , 2001 , respectively , and this request is for information from may 1999 for any contracts in effect on may 10 , 2001 .
i am still waiting for the files with the actual data , and i will forward them as soon as available .
a controversial issue in these proceedings has been whether the costs of transco 's twelve incrementally - priced leidy and southern expansion projects should be rolled into transco 's system - wide rates .
the 1999 policy statement , however , has a threshold requirement for expansion projects requiring that there can be no subsidization from existing customers - in other words , no increase in costs of any kind .
the pgt order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs could increase for existing shippers ; therefore , pgt had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that would apply absent the new compression .
this sounds very suspicious - can you please investigate ?

a good friend of mine runs the pro bono c - bar service .
thank you for the very nice message .
hope we can get down to houston soon .
by the way , i finally got to make a c - bar presentation to bracewell in houston , which marcy organizated , and the firm is now actively involved .
we work very closely with v&e and are still very interested in the partnership model .
attached is additional info for corporate counsel and the role they can play in c - bar .
on the advisory board front , we are currently looking for transactional attorneys to serve on a new houston advisory board for c - bar as well as a newly restructured statewide operating board .
the quick and easy low down is that the advisory board is a very minimal commitment with 1 - 2 meetings a year in houston , and the operating board will serve as a more traditional operating board , with 4 meetings a year .
now that texas c - bar has gotten off the ground , we are working on building 3 regional advisory boards as well as a new statewide operating board to help us build on our first - year successes and explore ways to expand our pro bono opportunities for transactional lawyers .
as the only statewide business law project in texas , attorneys who serve on our boards will be able to play an influential role in the future of business law pro bono and have a long - term , positive impact on low income neighborhoods throughout the state .
hope all is well in austin .

you will recall at the wspp meeting in colorado i asked mike small if he would n't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups .
i would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture enron policy on wspp approach .
every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements , one that is almost like the other one .
the wspp should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for rto west , dealing with the emerging california changes , and open access in oregon and nevada .
therefore , this policy would let our marketers praise the wspp for being a great organization , but at the same time , advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects .
rosman should say : enron loves the wspp , it has done a great job with the contract reformation , that task is done , we now should move on to bigger and better tasks .

it was also good to hear that both of you are optimistic about the outlook with ubs .

having considered the opportunities relative to the outlook for my consulting business , i am not interested in pursuing the ubs opportunity at this time .
i would be interested in a follow up meeting with you and tim , but i think my intent would be framed from exploring potential opportunities to provide consulting services to ubs rather than exploring employment opportunities .

we concentrated on the filterable dirt spec , an area in which we believed we had the best chance of proving our case .
there are three possible explanations that we are considering regarding the difference between sgs 's results at loadport and the results during the joint testing this week : 1 .
sgs 's results are not credible ( unfortunately , this would tend to be supported by the pre - sale analysis by ect of the same or similar product that , if my memory is correct , was somewhat off spec for filterable dirt ) ; 2 . the age of the samples ( which were taken mid - year last year ) may be a factor ; and 3 . the " bug " earlier reported by sgs , if it exists , may be a factor .
it would also give him time to hopefully liaise with paul henking and have paul arrange an interview with the sgs surveyor who suggested that the cargo might have a " bug " in it .

thanks for particpating last year name the charity(s ) , a worthy cause type thing state
the vendor name will be announced at the party , good advertising attach the article from last year
since we will be using the merge feature we can insert the name of the vendor in the body of the letter .
since our system only has a product specific sigma , if we try to calculate a 90 day sigma factor we will see significant results which will not represent reality .
for example , if you take the 1 day sigma factor for west power ( 18.97 ) over a 90 day period you will get results that are unreasonable for any short position .
we need to think how we can build this given the limitations in the current eol system .

the exchange , enron says , acts as a sort of middleman for carriers to find short - term contracts or quick fixes as they complete network construction or try to manage heavier - than - expected network traffic .

this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second - quarter results .

to deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in today 's environment , companies must focus on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers , customers , employees and investors -- while working with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market , " according to smith .
a major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed , but california 's political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks .
the confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decision - making will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis .
contributing factor in economic softening -- uncertain energy reliability and higher costs can drive - out marginal businesses , cause healthy companies to constrain expansion , and lead new entrants to question whether to make new investments .
in addition , limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy .
this makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems , from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability .
however , many have expanded their risk management programs , reduced spot market purchases , begun emphasizing long - term supply contracts , planning new power generation capacity , and started hedging with futures trades .
-- plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures -- companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider .
innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customer 's price to the real cost of supply will better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions .
in addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supply - demand equilibrium , companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs .
these programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier .
assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions -- companies must take a broader view -- beyond typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of generation and related business decisions in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices .
-- develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity --
in the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages , companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand , including for example dsm , flexible pricing and distributed generation .
in addition , they should explore efficiency - improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate near - term construction plans .
-- prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions .
-- provide special incentives for rto investment , formation and development .

hi marc - i just got back from london last night .
hi louise , i tried to call a moment ago , but unfortunately you were engaged in a meeting .
i wanted to let you know that the message from you below has caused some concern with my team , as they are struggling to see how they can accomplish this to your satisfaction by end of this week , and geoff storey himself was wondering how we could even get to transport valuation in erms in that time frame .
they are heading for a draft by the end of the week , but feel extremely uncomfortable about committing to timing and full scope untill they have had more time to work through it .
could you please let me know if you are expecting a signed document at the end of this week? ......
i hope that this is fine with you .
i am more than happy to populate the spreadsheet as soon as i get it .
the florida supreme court may force a decision on the election before thanksgiving -- or the legal wrangling may continue for several weeks .
either way , we 're looking at gridlock in washington .
the swelling surplus could reduce the outstanding volume of treasury bonds by as much as 15 percent over the next couple of years .
that could mean more earnings disappointments from economically sensitive companies over the next couple of months .
in the long run , though , gridlock could lay the foundation for a resumption of the stock market boom .
debt reduction and an economic slowdown will probably encourage fed chairman alan greenspan to cut interest rates substantially next year , which would be a boon to the overall market .
i imagine that there will be a great buying opportunity for these stocks -- but they could get cheaper still .
i would think because of the history he has , we should , but i wanted to get your input .
eric , i think it would be good for you to join us for this meeting .
i 'm not sure that this subject is within your turf down there , but your historical experience may be useful .
but we should get together for a beer before you go to banff on the friday .

it will be interesting to see if electrabel still give us a price , since there have been cpte / electrabel discussions on the matter since we raised it .
as a simple example , we face the ludicrous situation that cpte allows us to wheel power through belgium from fr to nl ( et vv ) but refuses to allow us to buy from or sell to electrabel - with significant implications for the dutch as well as belgium markets , given electrabel 's strong position in both markets .
we insisted that in the short -term , capacity should be available on a uioli bases , block exchanges should be put in place asap .
they also seem to fend off any offer for us to consult on any issues other than draft decrees and certain " indicative plans " that are envisage ( see below ) .
in the long term leanne explained that the preferred solution would be market splitting .
changes to the existing proposed grid code to incorporate the new law .
inc. hi tana , profile manager is pending your approval for seminole electric cooperative ,
based upon the number of favorable preannouncements that greatly outnumbered the number of negative preannouncements , we remain confident that the third quarter reports should be relatively strong for most electric utilities and ipps .
we continue to recommend an overweighting in the electric stocks .
the ceo of pnm also said that pnm believes that the current agreement must be restructured if there is any chance of the merger going ahead .
kansas regulators want changes to be made to the corporate separation plan in order to provide a stronger balance sheet for the utility post separation .
the sec still needs to approve the merger , which is expected to be completed in the spring of 2002 .
could not have been done without you .
looks like we were looking at the right cameras .
we could probably get a group together , but clearly it would not include all of the earlier group .
we may be better to wait for an opportunity to speak with unanimity .
dr. kaminski , thank you very much .
of course , i 'll be happy to have an opportunity to work at such a wonderful company .
for the period of working , i still need to coordinate with my advisor and may need to adjust according to that .
please let me know whether i should keep contacting with deal bench team , for working period and for misc .
i appreciate you so much again , for arranging such meetings and giving me an opportunity .
all this opportunity will not be available to me , without your kind help .

, i 've been following your travails at enron with great sadness .

since i m sure you are up to your eyeballs in i - bankers and lawyers .
once you get the decks cleared , i hope we can find some time again for carribean cruises or whatever .
i hope it goes without saying that if there is anything i can do personally or professionally to help .
the ceo from lower valley electric asked how wyoming can benefit from competition in commodity and noted how walmart uses predatory pricing to kill off smaller local competitors .
the gov. gave a number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite rto west , etc .
i affirmed your interest in meeting with the governor and indicated we would be contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient .
i really think we can do this more systematically .
i look forward to working with you on interconnection and other power transmission issues .

clinton said $ 2.6 million will be earmarked to help low - income families and seniors pay for electricity bills that have more than doubled .
we 'll do what we can to help you , " the president said during a televised news conference at the white house in washington .
test case yields public outcry the san diego area is a test case for the rest of the country over the feasibility of electric industry deregulation .
new york , new england and mid - atlantic states are following suit , and they 're watching california carefully .
after a public outcry , the california public utilities commission on monday approved a plan that would cap customers ' electric bills for normal use , but they 'll pay market rates for anything extra .
in other words , if the electric company ca n't pass along the entire cost of buying the energy for now , they 'll be able to pass it along months later .
with competition , rates should come down and service should improve .
for one , the hope that consumers and businesses could one day shop for electricity as they shop for better deals among long - distance carriers was dashed , at least for now .
but supply did n't grow with it because no new electric generation plants have been built in the state for 10 years .
last year , the state approved five applications to build new plants , but they 're years away from becoming operational .
also , if you will be able to help in addition to the times listed beside your name , please let me know -- the more tuesday interviewers we have , the better !
we plan to finish round 2 by noon on tuesday so that we can all return home to trick - or - treat ! ! ! !

ken , thanks for your message .
i shall send you a copy today .
in case you are interested , i attach this paper on gas storage value modeling .
nerc wanted to be linked with it and not be left out , ( where this effort may be re - directed to eisb for continuation )
the next step will be at ferc to decide how the oasis 2 work is to continue and under whose leadership .
next week ( tuesday ) i would like to review all the interconnected issues so that we provide guidance to espa jose resolution on the role of nerc in developing market interface or commercial practice standards
whereas , reliability standards developed by nerc , relying on the expertise of industry experts , have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems in north america for over 30 years ; and whereas , with the opening of the transmission systems , the vertical disaggregating of the former monopoly utilities , and the introduction of marketers and independent power producers , nerc has moved proactively to make its standards process more fair , open , balanced and inclusive ; and whereas , to support the evolution of competitive electricity markets , the formation of large rtos , and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission grids , it is vitally important to standardize and make mandatory both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards ; and whereas
, nerc has taken a number of proactive steps to deal with the linkages between reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards , including spearheading the oasis " what " and " how " working groups that developed the standards and communications protocols followed by all transmission providers ; formed a market interface committee as a new standing committee of nerc to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability ; and initiated the formation of and facilitates the electronic scheduling collaborative ( esc ) , which recently filed with ferc a report on their efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling ( oasis phase 2 ) ; and whereas , the electric business practice standards being developed by the electronic scheduling collaborative ( esc ) are a complement to the new nerc reliability model on which nerc 's future organization standards will be based ; and whereas , nerc is recognized and respected as the industry 's developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission grids throughout north america , and whereas , the board of trustees recognizes the urgent need for uniform wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated with reliability standards ; and whereas , the nerc stakeholders committee has expressed a strong preference for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards ; be it therefore resolved , that nerc : 1 .
interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operational issues that may affect wholesale electric operations .
build on the results of activities to date regarding the new reliability model and new organization standards development process .
urge ferc to make use of the esc , which will use the new sector weighted voting model approved by the nerc board , for further development of wholesale electric business practice standards , including standards necessary for certain aspects of rto design such as congestion management and ancillary services .
commit to continuing to support the work of the esc until such time as an industry consensus is achieved on how to develop wholesale electric business practice standards within the nerc framework .
i would like to put some fire under this issue , as the " new sector weighted voting model " seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility .
however , i do n't know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot .
of course , those comments may have already been made at the board , and may have been addressed there .
these will be watched for the remainder of the day , but it is possible that these sites will be problematic over the weekend .
the comments are not helping in identifying what transaction it goes with .

i will be in route to houston on friday - catching a 9:00am flight ( told the kids that i would be at the airport at 2:00 am houston time to start back home ) .
we will only communicate needs improvement and issues .
there will be differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus ( may need to find another role within or outside enron which is a better fit ) .
message to someone new to enron in that category should be different .
glad they are here ; believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they will be able to make significant contributions ; doing the right thing to learn the business , but that contributions to date are not significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus ...
thanks for getting everyone on the same page on this .
hope you had a good flight to london and that the trip is going well .

to better know how much credit npc needs , i thought it would be good to see how much ft ces gets on each pipe .
there have been major changes to accounting standards in japan which , by the time they have all been implemented will have brought japanese accounting standards broadly into line with international norms .
hence there has been much talk about how best to unwind these cross shareholdings without further depressing the market .
this may get the banks at least part way out of the short - term crunch they are under from greater disclosure requirements , but with the japanese economy continuing to deteriorate , with serious consequences for the size of the non - performing loans problem , the japanese financial system will have to face the music sometime .
ifr - november 17 , 2001 standard documentation aimed at clarifying which company should serve as reference entity for credit default swaps in the event of a demerger or other structural change , such as a consolidation , will be put forward by the international swaps and derivatives association this week .
while the successor issue has been debated since the break - up of national power of the uk , the imminent break - ups of at&t and bt into smaller entities has underscored the need for improved documentation .
no successor will be appointed if the original reference entity continues to exist .
it came almost exactly a year after a similar decision by the most active new york dealers to drop restructuring as a standard credit event for us corporate default swaps .
the new definition was agreed at the end of april and released in may , but liquidity in the default swap market was hit in the early months of the year by the uncertainty caused by the debate .
the issue of obligation acceleration had not been a great concern for dealers until moody 's indicated that it was uncomfortable with the inclusion of what it viewed as a " soft " credit event in the default swaps that back credit - linked notes and collateralised debt obligations .
this might trigger exercise on a default swap , when there was still a chance that the covenant could be made whole before the fundamental default event - failure to make a debt payment - had taken place .
derivatives dealing heads in new york echo this sentiment and point out that buyers of credit protection will still be able to request that obligation acceleration is included as a feature in a swap .
the international swaps and derivatives association last week announced plans to incorporate fpml.org , a non - profit industry body dedicated to developing a business information exchange standard for electronic dealing and processing of financial derivative transactions .
in theory , liquidity should also receive a boost from a move to greater automation .
for smaller end users it means that there is less work involved in entering into a transaction , " said lynn .
no decision on linking fpml 's transaction standards with isda master and netting agreements has been made yet , but such a move is likely in the future .
joining forces with isda will also help raise the profile of fpml , but awareness of its potential is not a problem said lynn .
fpml.org 's architectural working group , and its working groups covering interest rate , foreign exchange and equity derivatives , will continue to exist as sub - groups of isda 's new fpml committee .
isda 's fpml committee will retain responsibility for approving new versions of the standard .
fpml standards currently exist for interest rate derivative products and forward rate agreements .
proposed rate structure from trader nav is $ 13,750 year 1 + an additional $ 250/day for each subsequent year .

i received a call from the confirm desk looking for paperwork on this deal .
they want our comments by close of business today , but we do have until tomorrow morning if you need more time .
chris , as per our discussion , i just want to confirm that we have the ability to break the contract with the epc provider at any time .
further , i want to confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process ( ie putting a number on a term sheet ) has been based on trying to maximize the short run value of the project .
in my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ena could create significant value from a project that we have very little invested .
please let me know if you would like this formatted another way .
as you may know , for the past several months the response and production
this request should be accorded high priority and given immediate attention .
regards , and i 'll be laughing with you .

: i talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in having our class build a shed for you .
we pretty much make whatever you would like to the specifications that you prefer .

we will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs .
with the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build , but if you let me know right away , by monday october 22 , that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time .
have a good one and take with you later .

the chief benefit of the hourly balancing market is that it would push both generators and distributors to develop more sophisticated purchasing and risk management strategies , which in turn would increase trading volumes on the polish power exchange , or polpx , analysts said .
the introduction of a fully functioning hourly balancing market would end pse 's current practice of setting monthly prices for balancing market electricity on the basis of estimated demand for the following month .
however , zerka said there were some technical teething problems with polpx 's software , and uncertainties related to the compatibility of software used by different entities .
this transaction is expected to close today ( friday , june 1 ) and the release would follow the completion of the deal .

according to sources , when enron releases the details of its sale today , it will say it is giving its trading business to ubs and hoping for a return in the future .
enron once hoped the trading unit -- which at one point accounted for more than 90 % of its revenue -- would fetch nearly $ 1 billion in an auction , with enron retaining an equity stake in the revival .
instead , the trading business is penniless , leaving enron looking more and more like a corporate pauper .
and with enron holding no ongoing ownership interest , ubs may have a chance to leave enron 's tarnished past behind .
and creditors are n't likely to make it any easier .

and as the coffee continues to trickle onto the market the gradual erosion in prices is set to continue , with $ 450 a metric ton a possible target .
some analysts had predicted that the low prices would cause producers to cut back or to move out of coffee production , but with the vast increase in vietnamese production in the past 10 years , little impact is expected if there are any cut backs , said others .
there are plans to remove less productive trees in vietnam , but this is likely to be offset by younger trees in more productive areas reaching maturity , said one analyst .
in the long term , participants believe the low prices will see producers being less able to add inputs , such as fertilizers and pesticides , which may help to stabilize production , but this is unlikely to cause the dramatic shift in supplies that is needed to lift world prices .
although the move has been widely predicted , such substantial stock builds will still have a bearish effect on prices short term , an lme floor dealer said .
unconfirmed talk is that major trade house enron is behind much of the stock build , in an effort to reduce the market 's nearby supply tightness and alleviate the large short positions they are thought to have built up on the july - for - a - week spread .

i was in somewhat of a rush yesterday evening and neglected to make the changes you had advised me about .
gus : are you able to assistance me in answering # 2 .
unless enron is providing significantly more disclosure to the buyer than to the rest of the world , i do n't see how a buyer could get comfortable . " said an arbitrageur with a new york hedge fund .
what worries takeover traders is the likelihood that any agreement would likely have extensive material adverse change , or mac , clauses , providing plenty of room for dynergy to exit the deal should more problems arise at enron .
the stock was buoyed by the reported bid from dynergy as well as a new credit rating from moody 's .
wall street may be biting its collective lip in the hopes that dynegy signs the contracts to buy enron and brings in a critical injection of cash .
but dynegy might be getting more than it 's bargaining for , particularly regarding enron 's numerous obligations to deliver its own shares in the future at minimum values .
stock any company that acquires enron may have to make good on those commitments to issue stock pegged to values much higher than $ 9.50 a share , or perhaps to make up the difference in cash .
a significant amount of debt coming due in the near term , and the potential for increased margin requirements from its counterparties in wholesale trading operation also puts further pressure on enron , the ratings agency said .
the company may not be able to retain investment - grade characteristics , " moody 's said .
energy and oil services stocks helped carry the market higher , getting a boost after russia 's prime minister indicated russian companies will join the organization of exporting petroleum countries , the oil cartel , in cutting production to lift oil prices .
the current profit profit picture , i think everybody knows , is pretty weak , but the focus is turning to 2002 , and that definitely is going to be a rebound year , " paull added .
heinz warned profits would likely be lower than expected .
the hope is that lower borrowing rates will prompt companies to spend and expand , in turn expanding global economies and corporate earnings .
enron corp. was most active on the new york stock exchange for the 10th session of the past 13 .
in what would be the implausible end to a remarkable corporate collapse .
i think in that case it might have been better to say , we`re just looking into it .
this is a business that is very heavily depend on looking good to counterparts , looking like its not much of a risk .
the deal could be announced friday and would include an immediate infusion of about dlrs 1.5 billion from chevrontexaco corp. , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , the source said on condition of anonymity .
chevrontexaco would contribute an additional dlrs 1 billion upon completion of the deal , though the source said talks could still fall apart .
neither company could immediately be reached for comment on friday .
the deal would also include an immediate injection of $ 1.5 billion for enron from chevrontexaco corp. , which holds a 26.5 percent stake in dynegy , and an injection of additional $ 1 billion when the deal closes , the journal said .
this would basically quadruple dynegy 's size with a very accretive earnings contribution , too .
suits a scheduling conference is set for jan. 25 and a judge will then determine if all the lawsuits should be consolidated and if the case should be certified as a class action lawsuit .
the fate of enron may turn , lawyers said , on whether it tried to cover up the transactions and their impact or whether it has sincerely tried to expose them and fix the damage .
the company has from the outset , and will continue to cooperate fully with the sec .
the deal , likely to be announced later on friday , calls for dynegy to offer 0.27 of its shares for each enron share , the journal said , citing people familiar with the matter .
the deal will also include an immediate injection of $ 1.5 billion for enron from chevrontexaco corp. , which holds a 26.5 percent stake in dynegy , with a similar injection of $ 1 billion when the deal closes , the journal said .
but enron has been able to get people to change their way of thinking about how bandwidth has traded in the past and how it will trade in the future , he said .
i think they realized there was n't going to be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , or ... they realized they were n't going to reach ( it ) anytime soon .
some are looking to dynegy to rescue the bandwidth market just as it is expected to rescue enron .
i think they 've been much more willing to help this market move along , " he said .
( enron ) thought they had the model for the way the world should work and the carriers would have to accept it .
while the carrier ca n't hedge its entire position in the bandwidth market , it can structure deals so it is n't giving away services that customers would be willing to pay for .
it can also make sure it has the proper credit procedures in place .
if enron disappears and the bandwidth market does develop , there will be more opportunity for the survivors , he said .
the first phase of enron 's controversial indian project has been completed , but work on the second phase was abruptly stopped in june following a bitter dispute between enron and the local utility , the plant 's sole buyer .
in that case , it may be forced to terminate the contract , and file for damages in the international court of arbitration in london .
but the bombay high court has said it will hear the case again on december 3 .
based on current trading prices on the new york stock exchange , that would value enron at about $ 9.50 a share .
enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies .
late last month , fitch put enron on review for a possible downgrade , while another , standard & poor 's , changed enron 's credit outlook to negative from stable .
dynegy has asked for an expedited review from moody 's and standard & poor 's on how the merger would affect its ratings .
enron drew down its bank credit facilities in order to shore up near - term liquidity , but faces significant debt maturities over the near term , as well as the potential for increased margin requirements from counterparties of its wholesale trading operation .
however , the rating agency concludes that the company may not be able to retain investment grade characteristics .
moody 's review will focus on enron 's ability to further improve its liquidity and capital position .
the two companies are " very close to reaching a deal ... they could make an announcement very soon " , said cnbc 's david faber .
yesterday , the companies confirmed they were in talks over a possible tie - up but said they would refrain from making any further statements until a definitive agreement is reached .
and , i guess all we can say is you have better opportunities in united states than many other places in the world too have a viable job and to make some return .
dynegy 's board is waiting for word from the major credit rating agencies to determine whether the acquisition would result in a significant downgrade of enron 's debt .
a deal with dynegy could ` ` end up with a capital structures that would be improved over time , and we would look at that liquidity structure . ' ' on dynegy 's credit ratings : when people talk about dynegy , they should look at the ` ` baa2 ' ' rating , which belongs to dynegy holdings .
it will be difficult to make it work . '
it would have an impact on the short - term . ' ' ` ` the markets will continue to function but there would be less churn , that 's transactions between traders .
and i 'm sure most traders would be happy to see enron continue . '
it 's one of the rare outcomes for a troubled situation like this , where the bondholders come out in better shape the equity holders . '
it looks like more money will have to go into enron . ' '
we can now look at the whole energy sector with a much greater degree of confidence going into winter .
new york , nov. 9 ( bloomberg ) -- kathleen vuchetich , an analyst at w.h. reaves & co. who helps manage the $ 1.3 billion strong american utilities fund , comments on dynegy inc. 's possible purchase of enron corp. dynegy shares make up 5 percent of the fund 's assets .
they 'll take the best businesses acquired from purchasing enron , and make them hum and sing . ' ' ` ` enron has three wonderful businesses that have been overshadowed by recent concern about some of the others : energy trading , energy management and their pipelines .
` ` it 's a wonderful acquisition for dynegy , ' ' said kathleen vuchetich , who helps manage the $ 1.3 billion strong american utilities fund .
according to average commissions calculated by dealogic , the firms could reap about $ 28 million in fees .
` ` this would make them far and a way
the biggest energy trading operation , and a dramatic rescue would help the approval process , which might have been difficult in other circumstances , ' ' said hamilton .
we 're frankly glad to be out of it . ' ' ` ` we do n't think the acquisition of enron by some other player would bring too much market concentration into one party 's hands . ' ' ` ` we think there are many other players in the gas marketing and trading arena that are very capable of growing their businesses and making sure competition will be there . '

send me some details for some fun weekend reading .
i think we could get everyone together at the same time as soon as monday .
janet , between you , laura and frank / gil you should be able to field a one enron team on this one .
laura / frank - this is an important one for the team - please work together constructively .
it sounds like their meeting went very well as they spent a few hours discussing keyspan 's situation in the northeast market and how an enron / keyspan " jv " would work .
chuck knows tom patrick and it would be a great way to show him how well our chicago jv has worked for both people 's and enron .
but i 'm confident that with laura luce / bill morrow and gil , chuck , and myself , it will work .
we may want to consider getting out with keyspan and people 's together in a more social setting sometime in march ( maybe the master 's would work ) .
i think keyspan has the ability to get out of the coral relationship early if they really wanted to ( it currently goes through april , 2002 ) although i think it will probably take the better part of next year to formulate the entire structure around this jv .
i think the potential is to have a commercial structure in place and effective going into next winter or coinciding with the termination of the keyspan / coral relationship in april 2002 .
gil will need to lean on laura 's expertise in how she set up the chicago jv throughout the process .
michael has excellent relationships with all the folks at keyspan and his knowledge of keyspan 's power portfolio and that power market will be critical .
although it is still unclear as to whether keyspan will decide to request proposals from several players , it is clear that with our overall capabilities and genuine desire to be flexible on the commercial structure in what we put together with them , chuck devario is very interested in pursuing more detailed discussions in the very near future .
and i 'll coordinate with kay on that .
i 'll be here all next week .

i am concerned about the proposed azurix project with the houston area water corporation and the city of houston .
they wanted some assurance from ken or jeff that azurix would be around as a part of enron if it were awarded the northeast water plant project .
last wednesday night i saw the mayor and asked him if his request through me had any results .
he said no , and that he needed to have some better feeling about the future of azurix .
i assume we are working hard to get this project but based on my conversation i would think we need to give some communication to the mayor from someone high up in the enron organization .
hope this looks as you expected .

by louann lofton broadband networking equipment maker adc ( nasdaq : adct ) reported fourth - quarter and fiscal year - end results yesterday after the market 's close .
looking ahead to the next fiscal year , adc expects full - year earnings per share to be between $ 0.68 and $ 0.70 , which is in - line with current estimates .
the company sees its sales for the year coming in between $ 4.15 billion and $ 4.30 billion .
our outstanding employees were key contributors in adc surpassing the significant milestone of one billion dollars in sales for the first time in a quarter .
the company will take a onetime charge in the fourth quarter of between $ 17 million and $ 22 million , or $ 0.08 - 0.11 a share .
the company has about 300 clients , and says it plans to start focusing heavily on its top 75 clients .
possible uses for the proceeds from the sale are debt repayment , acquisitions , and share repurchases , according to the company .
thank you , russell f. hackmann , cfa corporate equity derivatives lehman brothers inc. (

in addition , despite a weak earnings forecast from national semiconductor ( nyse : nsm +3.10 ) for the next quarter , the company commented in its conference call that the improvement in the quarter has come from quick - turnover orders from cell phone companies .

we are in the process of selecting a large number of reference credits to be approved for display on the web site .

with end - of - the - year loads firmly in place , most players expected little in the way of price movement over the next week .
the urgency generated by pressure from the davis administration to sign long - term agreements precluded the planning necessary for projects of such large - scale , according to the report , and resulted in the omission of important details which would have better shielded california in the event of failure by the supplier to deliver the power , or in times of excess demand .
this alone could cost consumers as much as $ 4 billion over the next decade .
temperatures were slightly below normal but above freezing , and expected to remain that way through christmas .
weather forecasts called for temperatures to dip to slightly below normal over the weekend in phoenix , while the latest six - to - ten from the nws was predicting below - normal temperatures for the entire desert region for the last week in december .
temperatures lingered between the mid 20s and the high 30s on friday , but were expected to warm into the high 40s by the end of the weekend , further shaving off heating demand for monday .
the latest six - to - ten predicted temperatures to be near to below normal from december 27 to 31 .
serc traders were scrambling to move what they could before everyone else stampeded from their offices for the christmas holiday , and few had any trades to report .
temperatures were not expected to ratchet up heating demand over the next five days , for despite below - normal temperatures across much of the region , daytime highs were predicted to reach the upper 50s .
and i believe they can do some good work to help you in your quest for world domination .
we are not worried if they want to go that way - the budget plans are way out of line though ( but they do need to tell us to stop the development we are doing for them ) .
richard , rick , and paul : can you please go scope out a spot on 6 in ecn as soon as possible ( today ) .
i could not have done it without you !
thanks for combining your budget spreadsheet with this document to create one concise email for rick .
all : when we spoke with bowen , et al last week , we determined that there were some deliverables that enron needed to pull together before we could get the application in order for filing .
we should probably tread carefully in this area .
however , if the neg dec was only preliminary , then the city has the opportunity to provide comments , and i suppose it 's theoretically possible that the city could seek an injunction .
i will advise everyone should there be any other developments in this area prior to the upcoming meeting with the city .
janie , do you want to work with regulatory to make sure we can comply ?
, thought this might be of interest .
draft statement on high nitrogen please review the proposed posting concerning the high nitrogen issue with el paso , and feel free to make suggestions or comments .

earl stated that we might be able to do this in california rather than the point we 're looking at .
this has the potential to be a big revenue maker for us .
i look forward to working with everyone to see if we can make this happen .
the following is an update on pgg earnings for the 2nd quarter and our ability increase our ebit for pgg from our last current estimate of 58 million to at least 62 million .
i talked with kirk steven 's this afternoon and after looking at our preliminary closing estimates for power cost for may , our june current estimate of power cost , and the amount of overview ( 25 million ) we had targeted for the second quarter here is what we concluded based upon the assumption that prices for june do not continue to degrade from current levels like they have over the last month .
there are two sensitivities to this estimate that could lower this number by a combined 6.5 million .
first we understand that we may be allocated charges for the tomas transaction that ran through the pgg books last year .
we will have to write - off these costs in the second quarter since the software would only have value in a peoplesoft system environment .
we will need to resolve this in the 2nd quarter or take the write - off which would reduce our ebit .
in addition , as we have communicated before with you , we still have an open long power position in june and all of the third quarter for reliability purposes which will continue to cause our earnings to be volatile .
there have been some structural changes in the california market that could tend to dampen the price curves for this summer .
we will continue to keep you informed on what changes we are seeing as we go through june in terms of meeting the 2nd quarter adjusted current estimate ebit numbers discussed above .
if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further feel free to call me at 503 - 464 - 8982 .

however , i would appreciate very much your inputs and opinions .

we previously proposed a transaction to establish a jv which would pursue the wholesale intermediation market for long haul bandwidth ( see attached draft ) .
you seemed interested in our proposal but we have had difficulty in getting a follow up meeting to confirm your interest and get your thoughts on the proposal .
in the meantime , through adventis , we proposed a different structure where at&t would buy enron 's longhaul network and in exchange enron would take back a take or pay ( see attached draft ) .
but instead of at&t receiving value through an equity interest in a jv , at&t would receive value through the take of pay .
the deals proposed to at&t would assist accomplish this repositioning of ebs .

i would like at this time to initiate planning for your colleague vince kaminski 's annual presentation to the ut foundations of energy finance class which i will be presenting as usual the first half of the fall semester .

though japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market , significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure .
based on these changes joe hirl our president of enron japan will move to the global markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our global markets opportunities in japan especially weather , oil , lng , coal , and shipping .
we anticipate that his team 's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the encom power plant development team but he will also continue to provide support for global markets , ebs & industrial markets .

we will clarify what rac views as the current valuation of basic as well as rac 's recommendation with respect to this divestiture and modify the dash as quickly as possible .
is it correct to assume that if we use a typical market liquidity premium of 30 % ( i.e. , future divestiture proceeds are 70 % of the expected terminal value at the divestiture date to account for potential changes in future market conditions ) in a sale deferral scenario and this deferral results in a higher npv at the rac capital price than the proposed sale proceeds , ena would elect to retain the asset ?

much of the same was predicted for the next five days , with a slim rise in temperatures by the weekend .

i was asked the terms under which we were prepared to negotiate and i told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the indian authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the mseb .
i think the usg wants to be on record politically encouraging the indian govt . to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes of working things out before it is too late , even while through opic and exim it is supporting the move towards pnt .
the administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the usg has politically taken a position on the project .
so i anticipate that the usg will shortly be meeting with the indian ambassador here and the us charge in delhiwill likely be directed to make the rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project .
i wanted you to be aware of this ; also any guidance you can provide would be helpful .
you might want to confirm this with richard sanders who worked with us on this issue .

significant changes include : - added definition of counterparty - added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect compliance with 154.202 - included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated rate - added an example of how options will work
i think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option fee explanation i have in this draft , or whether we should instead state the fee will be market based , and include an explanation that , pursuant to the commission 's discussion in order 637 , market based rates are appropriate because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we are n't withholding capacity from the market .

dear sara hayes , i needed a clarification regarding the trading season .
i thought the trading season starts from may 01 to sep 30 of each year for nox sip call .
the month of may is not included in the trading season , so by giving allowances during that month , ohio would effectively be giving an extra month 's worth of allowances for free .
the allowances in may are in addition to epa 's approved nox budget for the state .
epa has expressed " extreme dissatisfaction " with the approach and ohio officials expect that it will have to be removed from the plan .

for example prior to making adecision we may try to assign ourselves a score from 1 to 5 on our perceptionof the influence of the anchoring trap on our decision .
say ifthe result turned out to be as we had hoped to , we would put 1 , and otherwise0 .
at some point of time we will be in asituation in which we will have quantitative information on our biases at thepoint of making a decision and the results on our decision .
there are mathematical techniques ( saylogistic regression , neural networks , etc . ) that can help us combine the differentpieces of < i priori information into asingle index that is associated to the largest possible extent with thebeneficial final result .
at the very least we willbe able to put some weights on our pre - decision perceptions .
if we subscribe under the statement thattrading is not only a mechanical manipulation of statistical data , but alsojudgment , insight and human psychology , we may want to use and benefit fromsuch information .
the never - ending questfor designing an objective score based on publicly available information thattells us how the market will behave in the future may be quite doomed .

we need to tackile better and we need to do a better job of recognizing what the other team is doing .
linebackers have to do a good job on williams or he has a big day .
since linebacker play is not a strength on this longhorn team , we need to hope the texas offense has a great day .
brown said johnson and rb cedric benson are potentially great players , but he said both " have only been going to class in college for about two or three weekis .
he said johnson and benson will see more action as the season progresses and they learn more about their assignments .
i think texas can get both of them if the horns beat ou and a&m and if byrdsong continues to make some progress in the classroom . . .
it looks like dt earl anderson of san marcos has a good chance to keep his longhorn scholarship .
i want to give you the true picture , but i ca n't if you do n't cooperate on this .
i found a job starting after the first of the year , and i would like to put my son back in enron kids .
and i would really not have to start him over in another daycare , if possible .

the partnership marks the third acquisition of a u.s. electric utility by a foreign company , following scottishpower 's purchase of pacificorp and national grid 's purchase of the new england electric system ( nees ) , both in 1999 .
consequently , companies like powergen have developed unique skills both in the united kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through opportunities abroad .
lg&e should be a good partner for powergen , as the latter gains access to approximately 3.7 million customers .
altogether , lg&e 's two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about $ 5 billion in assets , which should support any further expansion that powergen might have in mind .
during the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition , standard & poor 's kept powergen 's debt position under scrutiny , although its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any significant downgrades in its ratings .
it is possible that powergen will continue to secure assets in the midwest since it has claimed that this will be a key area of expansion .
thus , speculation has been raised that the company may develop this area of its business in the united states as well .
consequently , many eyes will remain on the powergen / lge combination as it should be a good indicator of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be .
however all units should be available , but offline with the following exception :
also , thanks for your help with the omnibus forms .

there were a few companies that had exceptional december quarters and raised guidance for the march quarter and the year .
key discussion points 1 ) thoughts on competition and supply chain in general
the best gauge we have for looking at market share is license revenue comparisons for the last few quarters .
on the flip side , manu has better vertical diversification with a focus on transportation management and has won deals of late in high tech .
however , given its vertical focus , we would argue that itwo has more upside potential if high tech and industrial rebound more quickly than other vertical areas .
here are a few high level thoughts on the sector in general .
new products are important for 2002 growth - all the vendors are hoping that new products will be able to spark growth in the next 4 quarters both with new customers and with the current installed base .
today is options expiration , so this afternoon might be a little busy , i will attend just as soon as it slows down .
i pulled the latest confirm that we entered into with your company and did n't see any chnages .
could you please call me to discuss ?
miguel , please make sure mark is in the loop .
according to facilities the 4th floor of three allen will be available starting april 1st .
i just finished a walk through of the space and have the following comments about possibly moving hpl on to the floor : it is a mezzanine type floor which has overhangs which are open to the elevator lobby down below .
we 'd need to stick trading and logistics into some of the large offices or joining conference rooms to keep them away from the lobby noise .
we 'd need to pull additional cable to handle the approximately 150 people that would need to be on the floor .
if we decide so to use the floor we could get this done within a couple of weeks at most .
we 'd need to put together several people in each office to fit everyone into the space .
that means to make this work as is hpl would have to remain on our network and depend on us for telecom service via our nortel switch during the stay in three allen since there would be nowhere for aep to put servers or switches on the floor without any major build out .
the good news is that keith dziadek and his team have figured out a way to make the eol connection with aep work that will have minimal impact to eol .
i will be receiving a floor plan today and will kindly forward a copy on to someone within your group to work with bill donovans group to see if there is anyway to get 150 people on the floor .
there will be some costs to set things up like additional cabling and installing some additional desks or workstations .
if we decide to do this we may need to purchase an ipc switch , system and phones .
i will also check to see if we have a switch anywhere that we could borrow for a few months .
we need to decide very quickly if this is what we want to do if we are shooting for having people over in three allen for the april bid week for may production .
the bigger issue would be the interface with aep 's peoplesoft system since they would be generating payments via this application .
the good news is that may production for physical trades will not settle until june giving them extra time to finish the interface .
our side of the interfaces are pretty simple and i feel confident we will be ready to test in april .
louisville gas & electric general terms & cond 's for call options
please advise at your earliest convenience as they are looking to do something as early as this week .
please let me know if i can provide you with additional information .
chris balmer , pam jaynes , and i will be giving you a call on tuesday to discuss lg&e 's hedging plan , seek your comments , and address any issues or concerns you may have in advance of actually sending out the bid letters .
we believe it will be useful to seek your input and answer any questions you may have at this point , since once regulatory approval is received the time to implement the program , seek bids , and consummate transactions will all have very short turn around times .
the first is a draft bid letter and the second is the general terms and conditions under which the call options will be purchased .
please review the attachment and pass them along to whomever may need to be involved at your company .

the decision to send the notice of termination was made after we were informed by the hhsc of a new individual member premium rate that would cause the already substantial losses we have incurred from the chip program to grow even more rapidly .
the new rate is predicted to cause an additional $ 16 million loss over the next year .
we are relatively confident that both our past loss , which is 25 percent of the total , statewide chip loss , as well as our projected losses are larger than those of any other program .
we know it can be improved in many aspects and will dedicate ourselves to helping identify those improvements .
thank you very much for your continued support .

george , i ve read through your stuff on the gomez remediation and need some help .

i d like to get to that position as quickly as possible .
as we discussed earlier the approach taken will require two additional fields in our financial confirmations .
since we are continuing to prepare these written financial confirmations the normal back office procedures will apply to their issuance , and thus this requirement should not have any direct impact on the on line systems .
it does however introduce a requirement to make a change to the confirmation templates which needs to be in place ready for the first on line transactions in september .
i believe there are different templates in use for the different financial businesses .
i suggest that the two new fields required in the financial confirmations are included under the section outlining the general terms of the swap .
if different to 1 , insert country in which the office through which the counterparty will make payment is located >
once new customers are established ( and also for existing customer base - would this be a good way of approaching dealing with the existing customer base with the aim of eliminating annex a which are different only because of the tax reps ? )
perhaps a good way of maintaining this data would be to set it up on a spreadsheet [ or the counterparty database ? ]
thus the decision on which countries to insert would only need to be made once on setting up a new counterparty .
for example the spreadsheet could look like this : counterparty description counterparty payor jurisdiction counterparty payee jurisdiction
the responses to the 3 legal information requirements set out on the new customer registration form [ will link directly to the counterparty payor jurisdiction and the counterparty payee jurisdiction fields on the relevant financial confirmation ] or [ should be entered into the counterparty database ] or [ should be entered into the spreadsheet for maintaing tax representation
[ the onus is on the customer to identify errors , but we should probably act in good faith in assisting to identify obvious errors].

deed restrictions are the best tool that the property owners in the houston heights have to curb over - development and the encroachment of commercial businesses .
as a volunteer - based 501(c)(3 ) charitable organization , the hha is dependent upon volunteers to donate time and effort to maintain community assets and services that improve our quality of life ; these include donovan park , marmion park , the fire station at 12th and yale and the esplanade of heights boulevard .
the hha recently revised the restrictions to protect the neighborhood from dense townhouse construction and encourage preservation of some of the few remaining larger lots in the houston heights .
by early 2002 the revised restrictions will be voted on by those properties that are currently restricted .
their passage is vitally important to encourage development that suits the character of the houston heights .

i wanted you to review this summary of the current state of affairs and compare it to your team 's opinion on the situation .
we do not want the situation to become an " us v. them " mentality , so i am taking this opportunity to solicit your feedback .
dennis and i are hoping we can work diligently to make up this time and resolve these issues in a joint effort .
we look forward to your comments and completing this link once and for all .
please let me know if i can provide any other input .
concerns with status of enron integration testing chris , dennis asked that i send you a note expressing our concern with the delays that we have been experiencing with the enron integration testing .
we have been continuing to research the problem on our side and so far it looks to us like the data is arriving on our server without the spaces .
last friday they were not able to spend any time working with us because they were getting ready for their maintenance window .
part of the reason for some of the delay on enron 's side may be that the group that is involved in the testing has had to go back to the developer group for assistance each time they have encountered a problem ( at least that 's our understanding ) .
the reality of this situation is that we have one project but many different disconnected teams working on the project .
as we move forward we would like to make the following recommendations to improve the speed of our testing activities : 1 ) rather than working as two disconnected teams ( testing via conference call ) , it would be helpful if we had an enron person here in our office each time we test and communicate back to enron the results that we are getting .
the enron resource should have as their priority to work with the necessary groups within enron to resolve issues as quickly as possible .
the developers group needs to address problems that are reported by the testers as quickly as possible .
we welcome any other suggestions that you or andy have to improve the speed of our testing and implementation process .
please let me know once you 've had a chance to speak to andy if there is anything that he can do to provide us resources to proceed with our testing more expeditiously .

the impact on large industrial users , he warned , could " provide an impetus for a statewide economic downturn " in california , which accounts for about 12 % of the united states gdp .
the bad news for california is that the list includes many silicon valley enterprises or " wannabes " whose growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the dependability of future electric supply delivery .
and they said , yes , we can introduce you to company after company after company .
the u.s. department of energy last month announced that the energy conservation measures could save consumers and businesses more than $ 19 billion over the next 30 years .
though the energy saved would eliminate the need for 40,000 mw of new power generation , the new standards would n't be phased in until between 2003 and 2007 .
stan thomas , director of business planning and growth strategies for sierra pacific power co. , nevada 's dominant energy company , said his business has " experienced great success " at moving silicon valley - based firms ' divisions into nevada , albeit in a limited way .
both developments are significant because the company has switched its strategy to become more of a power transmission distribution company than a generator .

while the new day trading rules offer increased leverage , they also present the opportunity for greater losses .
we ask that you take the time to understand how the new day trading rules will affect your account .
however , we still ask that all margin account holders be educated on the new rules as they may affect your account .
should your account be tagged as a pattern day trading account in the future , datek will notify you of the designation .
as an added benefit , we will display your day trading buying power in real - time on your portfolio and trading pages as soon as the new rules go into effect .
since our systems have no way of determining whether you will hold the position overnight or just for the day , it 's your responsibility to enter trades that remain within the buying power for the type of trade you 're making .
should you need to meet a day trading margin call , the fastest way is by wiring funds to your account or sending an overnight check .
for help with mailing addresses and wire instructions , go to .
we are ready for these changes and are taking all the right steps to make sure you are ready as well .
fully understanding your risk tolerance and the new nasd / nyse margin requirements allows you to better manage your margin account .

re : regulatory support mark , thanks for your note .
our focus will be on the efficient operation of the assets , cleaning up problems , finishing projects etc .
the sales efforts will be conducted through cliff baxter 's group with support from us .
so , i do n't believe that i will need the type of effort that you believe david can provide and i have no other need for him at this juncture .
cliff may feel that he has the need for david .
by the way , my experience with david when he worked for apachi was that he had not learned much about the business and therefore was not terribly helpful to us as we were restructuring the group or when we were in a build mode in thailand .
, i expect that you will have issues that will require support from my team , covering everything outside the americas
any thoughts either of you have regarding what your requirements might be would be helpful .
my understanding is that a fair bit of your effort will be focussed on asset disposition .

within five years , the bandwidth market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets , " he says .
so for us , it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business .
but critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas , especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications .
and critics add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell capacity , they might prefer to do it through some channel that 's independent of the control of a single market maker like enron .

accordingly , in addition to persons having the titles listed in article 262 ( above ) , the general view is that persons having titles such as general manager and division manager ( bucho ) , will be deemed to have the authority to represent the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the company 's business for which they are responsible .
in formulating an approach for enron to take on the basis of the above law , the following factors are relevant : ( a ) practice regarding representative director seal
as in many other countries , the answer depends on factors such as those noted in ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) below , which vary company by company .
( e ) degree of exposure to the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to expose the counterparty to considerable liability , the possibility of a counterparty in the future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant a reasonably conservative approach .
for example , if it was sent to the general manager of the relevant department , but the application came from a section chief , there would be strong argument that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary authority .
since the law concerning execution by a representative director can be considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in some countries , and by two directors in for example
accordingly , it should be necessary for enron to take a more stringent approach to japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in other countries .
the procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient for japan as well , although some adjustment will need to be made for japan 's unique regime of company titles .
less conservative approach major companies for major japanese trading companies , banks , insurance companies and other companies of equivalent size , the following approach could be adopted which would not be out of line with market practice :
smaller companies for other companies the approach would be as set out in 6 . above .
perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark for dividing between small and large companies .
we 're seeing enron sell off just like a lot of other companies .

we are a national contractor with - what we like to call - a local presence because we are capable of doing the largest projects as evidenced by a recently awarded $ 13 million contract with con edison and trc companies , but we are also able to respond very quickly to even the smallest projects in the $ 10,000 to $ 50,000 range .

i trust this meets with your understanding .
additionally , the experience was a good one simply because it offered an opportunity to better educate other group members on ebs and telecommunications in general .
i would not recommend re - forming the group at this time .
i think many of the goals the group was initially formed for are actually being achieved now through better organizational structures and closer collaboration between ebs support personnel and international group members .
i am a little unclear on what personal feedback you want on group members .
suffice to say , everyone was helpful during the brief time the working group was in effect .
but i can give more detail on individuals if you would like .
thanks for the opportunity to lead a working group ( even for such a short time ! )
and please let me know if i can provide any additional information .

our position with westlb is that we do not reach commercial operations until we reach the start date of the petrobras contract .

please see the following prototype sheet that i have made , i have checked with bill and greg , and they both agree that this format will give real time the hourly shapes that they need , with tag numbers referenced for use only if problems occurr .
this sheet could be created and sent after the e - tag deadline has passed , giving epe 's group ample time to get all the information that they need before real time would ever need it .
by comparing the e - tags that epe recieves to the volumes they have with other counterparties , epe has the benefit of a cross check without adding a layer of work to themselves .
enron would benefit by still understanding the quantity of generation and load that the real time desk needs to see , without adding a burden of repetitive work to our already overloaded preschedulers .
having epe generate this abbreviated sheet for epmi real time would still give excellent quality of information without many of the logistics hurdles that we currently have .
please take a look at this sheet , and see how you like it .
i welcome any questions or comments :

with respect to future enron guarantees , there are at least three issues to be addressed in addition to the pervasive objective of transitioning out of the parent guarantee : 1 .
i believe this is already being done for new bids .
negotiating transferability of the guarantee , i.e. the guarantee can be assumed by another credit - worthy entity with at least investment grade or , if necessary , at least a rating equal to enron 's at the time of assumption .
logically , owners and project lenders should be willing to accept these structures -- even though there undoubtedly would be strong initial pushback .
discussion of these issues should be included in the dash .
in any event , each new contract requiring an enron guarantee will have to be approved by rick buy personally .

enron 's projected volumes for newsprint sales and purchases form a small portion of the total annual sales estimated at roughly 15 million tons for the north american region .
in any case , when more production managers start to get convinced of enron 's ability to provide product that will satisfy their printing presses ' specifications , " that 's where the evolution starts to happen , " said mcmahon .
another way mcmahon believes his company can accomplish its goals is to create a pricing benchmark .
` ` we ultimately expect this company to be successful .

sme lenders ' initial concerns included the steepness of basel 's credit risk weighting curve for the internal ratings - based ( irb ) approach , its insistence that expected loss provisions should be made in addition to typical unexpected loss provisions , confusion over which sme loans could be included under the retail approach , and the extent to which physical collateral could be used as a risk mitigant .
the basel committee has since issued a paper , ' potential modifications to the committee 's proposals ' , which outlines current thinking within the committee and indicates that it will make key concessions to sme lenders .
we have got very long maturities , this would put german banks at an enormous competitive disadvantage compared with other countries , " says winkler .
what kills a bank is deterioration of value , and it has got to provide for a lot of things on the books , so you ca n't wait for final default , " said a basel committee member .
he said his hands were all but tied on the maturity debate , and confirmed that the german side would be prepared to scupper basel ii 's timetable should a deal fail to be reached .
i have difficulties imagining that we would introduce basel ii in europe and not have a level playing field on a g-10 basis .
while hofmann said the matter was " very serious " , he remained confident that all sides could reach a solution .
asked if the us team would agree such a concession , he added , " i could n't say that we would , but it would depend on the whole package .
another area of potential compromise is to allow banks with loan maturities of less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment , while banks with loans of more than three years would be capped at the three - year level - as factored into the current proposed standardised credit approach .

the paper proposes that a function based on the relationship between asset correlation and size should be added to the irb risk - weight curve methodology based on the relationship between asset correlation and probability of default .
retail businesses and wholesale businesses may have similar turnover , but the characteristics and the way you would manage them in risk terms would be quite different , " says colin jennings , senior manager , non - retail related risk at lloyds tsb , the uk 's third largest bank .
the committee believes banks should put aside capital for expected losses in addition to the current practice of making capital charges against unexpected losses - credit risk .
we fear that this could lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for german banks because of tax regulations , so we are very much against covering expected losses with regulatory capital .
we will be able to use isda resources which will speed up the implementation of version 2.0 and the development of version 3.0 , ' he says . '
the standards committee ended up doing a lot of the administration work to run the fpml symposiums , and we hope to leverage off isda conferences ( for future symposiums ) .
since we have been working on isda documentation then converting that into xml , our work has a natural fit with isda , " says meinel , operating from inside isda will help the development of fpml be better aligned with the documentation of new products as it comes along .
strain robert pickel , isda 's chief executive officer , says the merger will allow members of fpml to focus on technical development .
we envision adding some extra staff , and we project that we will be able to find the extra funding needed through due - based revenues ' says pickel .
creating fpml is as important as the isda master swap agreement , because it will strengthen the framework for the swap negotiation .
brickell says blackbird was the first company to offer fpml confirmations to its customers , and he believes isda will accelerate the adoption of 2.0 and expand fpml further to cover more kinds of transactions more quickly .
observers say the success of the project depends on recruiting .

due to the speed at which enron filed for bankruptcy , respect for loyal employees that were let go , the general state of the economy , and time of year , it would be appreciated if someone within the company could work with the court to assist employees in providing relief in the form of the severance package rather than each of us having to petition the court .
george , it is probably worth speaking to them about the us assets - probably the smaller virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great brownfield sites .
i 'm not sure we would have an interest in uk coal fired assets .
however , i would caution that real value is created through rapid brownfield development leveraging on enron 's development , electricity , coal and emissions talents .
so it may be worthwhile ; however , i think it may be difficult to arb these guys .
as well , i think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them -
we should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core virginia assets .
we should consider contacting them to determine their interest to divest any part of their us generation asset portfolio as well .
it may be possible to pick up one or more coal fired generation assets from mission , and expand their existing capacity .
this may be another approach to pursue as well .
let me know if you think we need to work eme .

new cost centers have been set up due to the reorganization and we would like to begin using these as soon as possible .
i look forward to meeting you and working with you very soon .
i do n't want to say that we were premature in beginning the open season , " said pg&e spokeswoman christy dennis , who noted that the company simply " has pulled back for the moment " due to the " huge reorganization process " related to the company 's chapter 11 bankruptcy .
dennis could not cite a specific date when the open season would resume , but she said " it should be reinstituted within the next few months .
the utility first announced the open season in late may , saying that it planned to offer more than 1.2 bcf / d of backbone capacity on the redwood , baja and silverado paths on which gas from malin , or ; topock , az , and california in - state gas production is delivered to pg&e 's local transmission system and other pipelines .
the utility , which currently transports more than 3 bcf / d of gas in central and northern california , projected that the additional in - state pipeline capacity would be in service by jan. 1 , 2003 , but the open season suspension could very well push back the date .
it is will be strictly technical to technical professional meeting to get to know each others group .
we will have to sort all this out when we have a chance to talk to john & scott .
two senior executives to retire in company split fyi eastman has announced senior executives for the two new companies .

russel would be a great guy to cover those guys for egm for crude and products .
also , when we talk about other grm products , it will help to have more fund coverage .
if for some reason that relationship does n't work out , we can revisit it with her at that time .
that person should work for gm and work in partnership with ena , kind of a jv between our groups , but with the origination for each product staying with the appropriate business unit , as you plan to do .
given that , i would recommend putting russell dyk in that role , have him spend the next 2 months working on the crude desk to kick start the coverage and then move him to ny .
if we need more support , we can add an associate to work for them jointly in ny .
overall , we 're leveraging our hedge fund relationships to generate more origination income for enron .
there is , of course , some risk that counterparties will want these provisions to be bi - lateral , which could introduce the ability for the counterparty to use these concepts to avoid the transaction if , for example , the market moves against them .
the spanish power market could be headed for a shortage in capacity for the next several years .
` ` we have worked in very good faith with the state , selling voluntarily into the market , negotiating with them for long - term contracts and working with them to solve the problem . ' '
buying the grid davis said at the meeting that negotiations to buy pg&e corp. 's power transmission system may take another 30 days , though he was optimistic an agreement could be reached within two weeks , analysts said .
the governor said he was optimistic an agreement with pg&e could be reached in two weeks , but negotiations could drag on longer , fetter said .
davis said at a news conference after the analysts meeting at the cornell club on the east side of manhattan .
` ` we are close to a final agreement with ( edison ) and relatively close with sempra . ' '
the governor told analysts he 's confident he can get a utility rescue plan that does n't require an immediate rate increase , but davis did say that rate increases are going to be needed at some unspecified time in the future , fetter said .
as i understand it , that wo n't preclude a clean opinion on nng this year , but the paje will continue in future years ' audits until the asset is approved for recovery in northern 's next general rate case .
therefore , if we have additional northern paje 's in future years , the combined effect would be used to determine whether or not a clean opinion would be appropriate in those years .

( dow jones)--after several tight summers , new generation and a new transmission line in texas should push the power region 's summer reserve above 20 % , according to a projections from the electric reliability council of texas .
while drought conditions have eased since last summer , the report warns that ercot 's peak could jump to 58,550 mw if forecasts provided by investor - owned utilities have n't included a possible shift in demand from customers participating in a retail pilot project that begins june 1 .
even so , more than 3,350 mw of new generation is expected to be online compared with last summer , pushing ercot 's net capacity resources to 65,064 mw , according to the report .
the ercot assessment says the new generation should keep the region 's reserve margin above 20 % in august when demand is expected to peak .
it includes 2,870 mw of interruptible demand , slightly below last summer 's 3,000 mw of available load that could be curtailed .
the current interregional transfer limit is 785 mw across the state 's two direct - current ties with spp although there is expected to be some limitation this summer due to a breaker problem near the east dc tie .
because ercot lacks synchronous interconnection with the rest of the u.s. power grid , the region has limited ability to import electricity in times of high demand .

in addition to the expansion , a new syrup batching system and water system will be installed along with utilities upgrades to handle the increase in volume .
( salt lake city , ut ) will provide general contracting services on the project and is expected to be completed by may 2002 .
the expansion represents the third major investment in the plant since it was built in 1990 .

the u.s. bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for enron 's trading business , once the most profitable unit of the company .
the motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale .
included in the auction are assets from its enrononline operation , which enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash - rich company .
under enron 's proposal , a 51 % joint venture partner would form a new company with enron to be called new energy trading co. , or netco .
enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things , in exchange for a 49 % stake .

to the extent we want to eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters , we will need their agreement .
from a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms for gtc - governed transactions without asking the customer first .
since some customers seem to want this pretty badly , you might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally available ......
create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for elimination of confirmations - large number of transactions , those that have asked for paper - relief , etc .

south african president thabo mbeki 's may visit to washington was marked by an anxiety that the next administration may reduce its contact with africa .
while the gore - mbeki binational commission proved that high - level intervention is essential to move forward on key issues , lacking was serious cooperation at the diplomatic level to respond to crises such as those in congo , angola , zimbabwe , sudan , nigeria , or sierra leone .
it remains to be seen if the south african private sector will seize this opportunity .
morrison says that in the future , the relationship will be evaluated according to the level of development of joint diplomatic initiatives in zimbabwe and congo , collaboration on the aids epidemic , security enhancement , trade and investment , and debt relief .

i certainly concur on the idea of pulling a short document together ; could you forward whatever is developed to sally and me , so we 'll be in the loop on that ?
i think jeff and kari will have a very productive meeting next wed.--not to say she is in a position to overrule others with different perspectives and agendas , but she is smart , a good listener , and was very impressed with steve and jeff last monday , so really does want to hear more on what enron thinks should and can be done to address all of the issues .
anyway , thanks again , and look forward to being in touch regularly on this and other matters .
the legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature returns next week , and the governor will be putting forth several legislative proposals in the next couple of weeks .
the meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of new information .
that leaves generators ... who they might want to either agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going - forward prices .
i think we should prepare a document for distribution to staff , legislators ( and anyone else ) that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forward ( eg in belden 's presentation and the seabron adamson whitepaper ) and wraps them in a more political context .
jeff will follow up with one of the staff members in particular ( kari dohn ) and i would suggest that jeff and sandi work together on putting the necessary political rhetoric around the solutions we have proposed .
do n't worry about the conference call , but thought it might be useful to review the proposals prior to monday 's meeting .
please advise us as to whether your have been invited , and who you are sending .

i think what he is trying to say is that you are calculating the historical vol correctly but to compare this ( historical vol ) to an implied vol from either the marketplace or as calculated by yourself , there will be an underlying assumption of a calendar year as the basis for option maturity .
therefore you would have to use the sqrt of 365.25 in order to make a comparison to the historical vol .

i was trying to clarify needs for the institute with other planning committee members , and then was involved in an unfortunate accident which has had be out of the office for a major portion of the last 2 weeks .
as previously discussed through your assistant , we would be interested in your participation as a panelist in a discussion to take place as part of the power institute to take place on june 7 and 8 , 2001 at south texas college of law ( downtown houston ) .
the segment i would like to solicit your participation in is entitled " e - commerce in the new energy world " at 1:00 pm - 1:45 pm which was originally structured as a " speech " , but the planners would like to restructure as a round - table discussion including legal representatives from pantellos ( confirmed ) , the newly - defunct petrocosm and yourself ( enron on - line ) .
the panel would be moderated with some " canned questions " that we 'd give you ahead of time , and some time for questions and answers from the audience .
there would be little preparation other than sharing your experiences .
if you are unavailable , we would welcome one of your attorneys from your staff .
it 's a great opportunity to " sell " enron on - line to a captive audience of industry participants .
thanks , bret bret l. strong winstead sechrest & minick

they would also benefit from knowing the skills that are important to those seeking employment with enron .

the project , under ispat energy , was to be a captive plant for ispat industries and would have significantly brought down the production cost for the steel major .
residents ' reaction has forced the regional government ( generalitat ) to halt the project , which should be given the go - ahead in the next couple of days , for two to three months .
williams cos . , the tulsa - based energy trader and gas pipeline operator , said monday that its fourth - quarter earnings from continuing operations jumped almost 300 percent thanks , in part , to the sky - high prices the company has been able to charge for electricity in california and other western states .
el paso said it hopes to have its project running six months before enron 's .
the rival projects underscore surging u.s. demand for lng , a process that allows natural gas to be shipped but that generally adds significantly to the cost .
while lng has been a vital part of the gas supply in asia , particularly in japan , it has never enjoyed sustained success in the u.s. , mostly because it has been too costly to compete with low u.s. natural gas prices .
to make el paso 's lng bet worth the effort , natural - gas prices have to stay above $ 3 per thousand cubic feet over the next decade , said ralph eads , el paso 's president for merchant energy .
; would you like me to work on the europe , asia and australia budgets since those are now under your control ; if so , are we looking for savings opportunities there as well

hi pete , wanted to recap our conversation yesterday , update you on our timing and get you my contact information .
once we have agreed on the universe of transactions , you and i will discuss and finalize a settlement amount that we are comfortable will be approved by the creditor committee and bankruptcy judge .
please seek bankruptcy council to determine if it will be necessary for a representative from your company to attend and , as well , to be comfortable with the process .
finally , we will provide you a sample release letter for your review .
we will seek your comments , if any , prior to the hearing date .
please call me if you have any questions regarding this .
i have included my contact information at the end of this email-- if you could return this email with your mailing address , i would appreciate it .
also , i look forward to working with you through this process , and finally , thank you for your time and attention to this matter .
thanks carolyn for forwarding it along .
eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a korea lng opportunity .
i certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my thoughts .
they are very good and i have a lot of faith in them and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects .
we have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot .
my very sincere hope is that he will stay in the lng group and perform a very important role especially in this type of development or deal making role .
especially in a big deal in japan , korea or something in the asian area .
but he can not be focuses as much as you need in korea or joe needs in japan .
please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail .
thanks , mike ps - frevert also likes this role for rick .
have a great time ..... and definitely hang out in the lounge of the hotel .
alfredo collaborated with the commercial team to make this possible .
to the extent the > request includes a request for information that is listed in iso tariff > section
peter just wanted to let you know that all the great work in blue range is paying off in the us - citing blue range , a houston bankruptcy court correctly decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the us safe harbor provisions .
this project , of all that have been proposed recently , probably has a better chance of success .
as such , they are probably a prime candidate for either phase i or phase ii of kern river 's expansion .
also , keep an eye out for el paso moving forward with commercial plans for the california leg of all american pipeline .
a large end - use plant like this could be the basis for an " en - rate " type transport program on el paso - all american , particularly if they get their allocation problems resolved at ferc .
as far as another article in gd , i 'll check with john , but i think it 's a good idea .

just thought i would let you know that we are too .
as a slight surprise , construction investment was flat in q3 rather than falling further .
as far as the outlook is concerned , there is good and bad news , with the bad news more associated to the near term and the good news to the more distant future .
the fall in the ifo index of business confidence suggests that equipment investment is likely to continue to fall in q4 and in the first half of next year .
we also believe that private households will remain cautious in the christmas season and increase savings , also taking the introduction of new private pension schemes next year into account .
we also expect both the negative inventory and the positive net export contribution to growth to be reversed , but this should have no significant net effect .
on the positive side , the ongoing decline in energy prices , which is likely to be accompanied by lower core inflation next year , is expected to boost real disposable income next year .
in addition , at some stage , precautionary saving is likely to be reduced both of which argues for a consumption recovery , even in the absence of employment growth .
as you can appreciate , time is of the essence .

it seems to us to be difficult in those circumstances for the inspector to conclude that a particular test result is reliable .
it would be prudent in those circumstances for enron to have commissioned a number of tests using d3605 methodology in order to present an average ( and hopefully on - spec ) result to counteract the test results produced by the buyer .
enron may want try to renegotiate the contract .
it may be that the point we have raised in 7 concerning the risk of an unlawful rejection by the buyer may be helpful in any such renegotiation .
if approved , ferc 's proposed revisions would affect enron by requiring electronic posting of certain transactional data by power marketers and entities selling at wholesale pursuant to market - based rate authority .
the effect of these requirements would be that enron 's competitors will now have quicker , easier access to not only the usual reported information but also to the transaction execution date which will disclose a place and time for the transaction .
i do not know whether we will be joining epsa 's comments or filing on our own .
please let me know your thoughts and call me if you would like to discuss .

if we wisht o offer a clarification , we could have gary send a short e - mail saying our inquiry into the june 99 data is continuing
you will note that harvey did reinterpret the 1999 request slightly from whether we would go back that far to how long it would take .
for example , per your request , we will review the electronic data base you provide us on the various transactions before we decide whether we will insist on the confidential financial records addressing any of the enron entities ' profits or losses in the purchase and sale of electricity in the wscc .
you also stated that we would receive the electronic data base for 2000 on oct.27 , 2000 and that you will check with your clients as to how soon you can get us the data for the transactions from june through december , 1999 .

given that interpretation , we tentatively decided the advice letter protest would be drafted to say at least these things - 1 ) the pe credit should include the 4 cents of surcharge ( the 1 from january plus the latest 3 now subject to rate design hearings ) 2 )
if the commission approves this advice letter , it should say sce has no further claim to stranded costs on its generation ; 4 ) as an interim measure until the commission fully looks at px credit calculations , we recommend that sce adopt a px proxy , such as dow jones .
bob , i know you 're getting a call together ; i 'll call you to confirm .
as you can see from below , i do n't see how we can support the pe advice letter .
i think we should clarify that sce will acknowledge our full claim ( $ 124 million ) without any offset in exchange for our cooperation with the mou .
let 's discuss further , but i believe that the tariff would be a " generic " one for network service , with the price , terms and conditions dependent upon the size and other attributes of the customer .

they all bought in that this was a sophisticated sourcing tool , that it followed their processes and would help streamline their operation .
shirley jo said that her primary use of this system would be for any purchase over $ 50k , which requires 3 bids .
their transaction fees for using the dealbench system are minor , so our pricing looks high , but that would be comparing apples against oranges .
do n't feel we need to elaborate on this at this point , possibly in future .
- can we utilize a hands - on demo to play with the system ?
we suggested a pilot , but also said that it might be possible to work something out over webex just to test drive a little more before moving into a pilot .

it is a bit long , but i think we need to cover the several points that it addresses .
no strings attached , you can do whatever you want with it ) , i think this is the way to go since ( 1 ) this industry is so sensitive to antitrust issues , and ( 2 ) tying provision of the pc to clickpaper usage implies a closer relationship with the customer than we really want , and we could n't monitor or enforce it in any event .
as soon as i hear back from him i will call you .

using data compiled by rdi , a data division of platts , the report estimates the u.s. will require 296,000 mw of capacity additions by 2015 to meet growing demand and to replace older units likely to retire .
disadvantages of new coal - fired generation are higher initial capital costs and greater risk , which means that new coal - fired plants are susceptible to depressed market prices that could result from overbuilding new capacity .
developers will have two choices in the near term if coal plants are to succeed : wait out the surge of capacity development and be prepared to enter the market later in the decade when the excess capacity is absorbed ; or secure long term power sales agreements and capacity contracts that will provide enough revenue to cover the high development costs of a new coal plant .
nordic to build power plant , ethanol facility in ohio nordic energy plans to develop the first new coal - fired baseload project in ohio in more than a decade , an 850-mw merchant plant in the northeast part of the state , the company said tuesday .

i know this is starting to look like the project that wo n't go away , but the power price number looks very promising to me .
i think its worth scrubbing down the model we 've used to replace the generic capital cost and o&m assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine configuration we 'd be using .
if this price is really as favorable as i think , can we make another run at the ena people and federal solutions guys to see if they have any interest ?

hi john just wanted to let you know that we still have not heard from tva , re dual interconnect with southern .
on the gleason facility , tva has been relatively helpful and has agreed to let us go " commercial " sooner than they otherwise would be required to .
you both may know this but the gas prices in last sunday 's revenue requirement analysis by dwr are still very high compared to current curve .
i assume if you put in the current curve the rr would drop further .
interconnect - mike s. asked why we could n't move ahead on filing for the waiver for the hemphill project .
i told him that before we could move ahead we will need additional information .
landowner " waiver consent " michele , earlier had a conversation with shelley on how filing for waiver may help the overall outcome of landowner notification ruling .

onexchange will start by trading futures on financial markets , but also plans to act as a clearinghouse for energy transactions .
but the changes also point to a more complex energy market , in the near term at least , as well as greater challenges for price discovery .
the cftc 's revised proposals will include more detail , for example , on how exactly to apply for registration .

the items discussed below are focused on the 2 abb turbines enron canada is interested in potentially acquiring .
the aa team for enron has been reviewing a considerable number of both sets of documents and the required language has changed quite a bit on both from early 2000 .
from a financing perspective : * we are currently working at providing a canadian lease structure for project moore .
from a cost perspective it would be best to wait until the structure is in place and have it purchase the turbines from westlb / perc .
the canadian structure should be ready shortly thereafter .
if there is a timing differential , our existing westlb facility for project moore can be expanded to house the perc turbines along with the existing n1s until the canadian vehicle is ready .
although perc would like a firm commitment from enron , this will be difficult without the dash being approved .
at the same time , perc and ena can continue to negotiate a contract for the rest of the potential transactions .
as for the rest of the assignment and option agreement , i apologize for being out of the loop but would someone please update me on how you see these transactions being financed .
i want to insure that finance and accounting are up to speed with these transactions so that if ena does move forward , it is a smooth process and balance sheet favorable .
i look forward to working with the team on finalizing the agreement(s ) for perc 's review on monday .
new deals since november 30 , 2001 also , please furnish a hard copy of all live confirmations under request # 1 above .

the meeting participants agreed on a few crucial elements of a solution to california 's power woes , including the following : development of approaches to promote long - term purchases of power , possibly by the state , from generators at an " attractive fixed rate ; " the willingness of generators and qualifying facilities and marketers to provide on a short - term basis " forebearance of amounts owed by pacific gas & electric and edison " in the context of a comprehensive solution ; the need to find " satisfactory approaches " to the utilities ' obligations to purchase power ; cooperation to " better match supply and demand ; " and review of the existing qualifying facilities payment structures .

it looks like eol will have a full t1 link with aep in place next week .
i will review this with network security and see if there are any issues .
enron should be ready to start testing our side by the end of this month and work out any issues in april .
if they are successful then we will need to see what is currently set up on the floor and come up with the best plan for getting the space up and running asap .
to do so we may need to provide network and telephony services instead of waiting on aep to build out their servers & install a phone switch .
hopefully the routing will be worked out next week .
the only thing left would be to make sure that the eol business folks are ok with using it for this as well as the direct connect to eol .
i believe louise would like to close by may but that would mean needing the link in place by early april so that we could test and be ready to go april bid week for may production .

as a part of that effort , the red mccombs school of business is trying to raise $ 130 million which will help it to achieve its goal to become the next great business school in the world .
however , much more is needed and will only be achieved through participation by a significant number of alumni and friends of the university .
on tuesday , february 6th at 2 pm , dean bob may of the mccombs school will be at the enron building to meet with us about the school 's plans and how we can participate .
this should be a very informal meeting with relatively few attendees ( hopefully around 25 people ) .
it will give you a chance to get to know bob , what is going on at the business school and how you can participate .
we hope the result is that you decide to support the effort .
there is a unique opportunity to participate at this time because , in addition to matching funds from enron , the mccombs gift provides for additional matching funds for contributions of a certain level .
i have found that this matching provides a real opportunity to make endowment level gifts .
the company has made a significant commitment to the school 's programs , we have a very significant presence on campus through our activities and support from administration and faculty , and we have enjoyed great success recruiting for a number of years .
however , enron has never successfully organized its alumni giving in a way which would allow for even greater enron support and presence while optimizing each individual 's contribution .

thanks for the note to david .
we learned in the last couple of days that e - mails were circulating within liquids ( commercial support and commercial ) back to early summer concerning the situation and need to hold the prudency ( first booked in july ) .
the key issue here is that david was asking for the information at the right time but was kept out of the loop ( not that his exposure reports did not include the m - to - m starting in nov. when we learned of the magnitude of the problem ) .
but there is no chance for the next couple of days
so i thought i would send you an e - mail .
we could not produce that result in any other area where we do business .
and i think we need a meeting to discuss these .
it is a good lesson for the rest of the group to amplify how important what we do is .
keep up good work and have a beer .

startup mining company hopes to expand only u.s. fluorspar mine , in an advisory by
located close to cedar city , utah , a start - up mining venture hopes to expand the only fluorspar mine in the u.s.
" price went on to say , " we 've started of on a small scale , but our market shows promise and if all goes well , we may look at expanding in the future . "
it is studying options for the sale of these minerals to new markets .
fluorspar helps to reduce the melting temperature of clinker ( an intermediate product of the cement manufacturing process produced in rotary kilns ) , enabling cement producers to increase throughput without significant equipment additions .
future plans include adding increased crushing , screening , and processing equipment to enable the company to expand service to the cement industry , as well as other metallurgical grade fluorspar users such as the steel or aluminum industries and possibly acid grade fluorspar users at some point in the future .

the company will sell the assets in those partnerships and , in a worse case scenario , will face a $ 1 billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets , enron has said .
the company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock , shares will be trading closer to $ 20 than their current $ 11 .
s&p is confident that enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole , provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company .
that relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely , but the desk has n't been able to transact for three weeks , since the value of enron 's stock and bonds began to plummet , according to another enron employee .
enron did n't respond to a request for comment , but the enron credit division in europe said in a release that lines are " constrained " as the market continues to evaluate the company 's credit position .
the company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want enron to survive .
and any company that moves to lock enron out of the market now could regret doing so if enron survives as the big dog .
in exchange for taking on that small risk , they keep the great market maker in business .
outside of long - term commitments , what worries the banks , which presumably got a good look at enron 's books ?
if enron is to have a chance , it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt .

this will impact us getting started on the hottap redesign project .
we are hoping that we will be able to pickup on the effort at the beginning of february .
just wanted to make sure you all were aware .
as stated below in brads " e " mail the range of deliverability we can expect on the midcon texas interconnects is between a minimum of 75,000 mmbtu / d and the design maximum of 100,000 mmbtu / d .
with the construction of these interconnects i believe there is a high probability of getting a 5 year storage deal done this year .
this would greatly reduce hpl 's spread risk .
i have run some additional flow studies for the east side of town to determine hpl 's ability to deliver gas to midcon texas at the proposed flagstaff interconnect .
therefore , it would be safe to say that with pressures at bammel ranging between 600 - 650 psig , hpl will only be able to deliver around 75 mmcfd to midcon texas .
but mathematical i still have a chance .
billy , it is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in # 2 are incurred , the project will be in e next ( or its successor / take out vehicle ) since construction will be nearly complete .
as a result , we determined that we needed more time for internal discussion in order to give you the level of detail that would allow a more meaningful discussion of the specific recommendations and potential modifications .
this will allow us to address both your questions and your suggested changes .
we apologize for any inconvenience this change has caused you , but believe that taking time to develop more details on these topics will allow more productive discussions .

when i arrived at work on monday morning , shirley asked me if i could call the brazilian consulate in argentina , and she explained the predicament you were facing .
i tried and tried to get through but all the numbers at the consulate were continuously busy .

i understand from her that you have finally been able to get to sao paulo , so i hope that the business you went to discuss has gone successfully .
i imagine that by now you may have been introduced to a good brazilian churrasco , tasted some real coffee , and perhaps sampled some of the many tropical fruits that brazil boasts of ( speaking from a culinary perspective ) .
if you have n't yet been to any of the brazilian restaurants here in houston , i would be happy to introduce you to them when you return .
i wish i could recommend good places to visit in sao paulo , but it is not really a city for tourists .
if you had more time , i could suggest some art museums , a visit to the municipal theatre , or some relaxation in one of sao paulo 's parks ; a trip down to the coast would also be worthwhile .
well , i wish you a safe return journey and look forward to seeing you back safe and sound .

but some said california could find cheaper prices for forward power if it waits .
power prices will continue to be very volatile for the next 12 months to 24 months , but the price of power for delivery in 2002 and beyond is likely to begin falling at the end of this summer , said gerald keenan , a senior partner for pricewaterhousecoopers ' utility consulting group .
it 's not a good bet that gas prices will stay high for such a long time , " he said .
still , california 's inability to find much power for this summer means that the state 's imbalance between supply and demand will have to be solved in the near term on the demand side , according to one perspective .
the current forward market reflects a skepticism that the meters and other conservation efforts will be anywhere near as effective this summer as the governor says .
sean , there have been quite a few name changes from various kn counterparties in the recent past , but no one in the group can remember seeing anything recently or can find any such documentation .

the company has been trying to expand outside new jersey as the state opens its energy markets to competition .
he declined to provide details on the size of the expansion .
before interest and taxes , enron reported a loss for broadband services of $ 35 million for the first quarter of this year compared to a break - even quarter a year ago .
we 're making excellent progress in creating a commodities market , " he said .
enron will seek to make deals with motion picture companies directly .
shares of enron rose $ 1.04 to $ 60.48 in trading tuesday on the new york stock exchange .
enron has consistently said it did not expect its broadband arm to record a profit until 2002 and instead has offered other measures of growth by which to benchmark the unit 's progress .
if you look at most of the large telecom companies right now , you would be hard - pressed to assume they could perform on a contract that is anything more than six months to a year long , " skilling said .
results in the latest quarter include a gain related to the required adoption of new accounting standards .
but the venture reduced its prospective credit exposure in the california market through its agreement with the california department of water resources to provide the state with up to 2,300 megawatts of energy through 2004 .
shares of enron rose $ 1.29 to $ 60.73 in trading tuesday on the new york stock exchange .
the company also earned 47cents a share for its first quarter , 2 pennies better than estimates and 7 cents better than the year ago .
i`m wondering if you feel a need to increase reserves going forward or you`re comfortable with the situation as it is ?
what we had said to investors , as long ago as december , was that we felt very comfortable with the $ 1.70 to $ 1.75 number for this year .
and we feel very comfortable with that number really regardless of what happens with the credit situation in california .
and i think that`s very possible .
it will soak up some of that excess supply and we might see prices coming back .
` ` if you or i were running a factory around new york right now , we 'd be calling enron or a company like them to lock in energy prices , ' ' credit suisse first boston analyst curtis launer said .
enron 's broadband unit , set up to build a u.s. fiber - optic network and help trade space on such networks , had a quarterly loss of $ 35 million on revenue of $ 83 million .
( adds company comment on future earnings and additional generation capacity in the fifth paragraph , closes shares .
next year 's earnings likewise should increase by up to 25 percent as dynegy continues to build or acquire power plants , he said .
` ` what 's driving the train for dynegy for the past few years is the continued adding to our portfolio in generation across the country , and i do n't see that slowing down in 2002 , ' '
northeast dynegy 's electricity sales and production rose 19 percent last quarter to 26.1 million megawatt - hours from a year ago , boosted by the addition of 1,100 megawatts of generation in the 2000 second half and the purchase last quarter of new york state power plants that can produce 1,700 megawatts .
` ` dynegy is in a good position to earn good returns from those plants , ' ' analyst anatol feygin of j.p. morgan securities inc. said .
` ` the press is full of prognostications that the new york area and the northeast are the next california . ' ' new york and new england wo n't have enough generators or power lines to meet demand if temperatures are higher than normal this summer , industry officials have said .

based on iso governing board approval on may 10 , these loads will begin participation in the demand relief program on either june 1 or july 1 , as feasible .
( note that pricing for the discretionary load curtailment program could be modified in the final design ; the iso expects to initiate the program in the $ 250-$500/mwh price range . )
please set up a meeting with all the people shown above and we will discuss how to correctly handle this in our system .
this is what i 'm thinking , everyone please think about this before we meet .

i know that we will want to receive the password very soon .
we have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to sell power onto the grid to epmi .
i 'll let you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers .
ferc decisional precedent indicates that a qf can lawfully sell at market - based rates without seeking market - based rate authorization from ferc , but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a qf to seek ferc acceptance of a market - based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event qf status is lost .

i ve dealt with these individuals before , but the adeq has gone through some reg changes and i want to visit with them on that .
after that meeting , i will decide who should do the applications .
he has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential kinks .
if this was a new station , i probably would nt be allowed to use the 45 number , but seeing as how there will be a major decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine , this should be easy to do .
and it will allow the facilities in az a larger range of operation comfort as opposed to the 25 ppm number that rolls says they can do , but has had trouble reaching .
by permitting at 45 ppm , this will greatly help this .
ill share the emissions numbers with you , when i receive them from rolls and the emissions info i have from the existing units .
based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation , the f-1 report will be completed by march 1 .
we are working on the kickoff documents , and will have them ready soon to present in a kickoff meeting .

the only changes relative to the previous version are as follows : i 'll give you a call shortly .
can you give me some feedback .
steve - when you get a chance , please take time to read david merrill 's status report below .
however , having said that , and before having received his report below , i was going to write you an e - mail indicating that i am afraid we can not continue to keep david in this role .
he was probably only a decent fit with the old enron apachi , when it was asset - focussed , and he could use his diplomatic experience to open doors for projects .
in any event , i simply do not see much prospect of persuading the ebs people to give david a chance , and i think i will be doing myself no favours with them by pushing it .
from where i am , i would prefer to have someone in singapore or tokyo , rather than houston , but the people in houston may want someone closer to them ( i frankly think it is a mistake to try to build a business in asia from houston ) .

rural communities face a new opportunity and challenge to prosper in this new world .
the opportunity - unlike the old economy , new technologies allow economic activity to be geographically farther apart while still functionally tight .
the challenge - much of rural colorado has limited access to high - speed telecommunications technologies , a critical factor in determining business location and expansion decisions .
federal , state and local governments , in partnership with the private sector , must help rural communities adapt and develop innovative , technology - based economies through seed venture programs , technology - incubators , industry - university research partnerships and collaborative technology modernization projects .
much like the digital economy , today 's economic strategies take a strong combination of good hardware and software .
the colorado congressional delegation can help with the " hardware " by pushing for federal funding to co - invest in business applications with rural broadband telecommunications providers .
innovative private - public partnerships like powerup can also help .
among powerup 's notable partners is the corporation for national service 's americorps program , which provides young volunteers who , in exchange for help with college tuition , go into communities to set up and help manage the computer centers .
as non - technical users and innovators , these " digital brigades " help train local students while implementing technology - based projects that improve and help the community .
colorado state and local governments should partner with the private sector and provide matching funds to spur development of rural technology centers .
universities and community colleges can strengthen the competitiveness of rural firms by analyzing the specific needs of local economies and offering consulting services on technology and processes .
public matching funds for joint university - private sector research can be tied to new product development .
new technology clearinghouses can provide data on new patents and ideas relevant to local industries .

i need to speak with you about the isda , omnibus and industrial master templates under revision and whether the drafted language conforms to your proposal .
in that regard , you may recall that swap templates were given to you several months ago .
i 'm glad the conversation helped give you some closure .
i am going to get cleaned up , will probably head out in about 2hrs and stay out .
you can reach me by im or by mobile later .
anyway , i 'm definitely up for a drink tonight > as well as shutting this door behind me and keeping an eye open for the > next one ahead .
please be ready to leave at around 6:00p.m .
i will start reviewing it as well .
dear all , if you recall , several months ago we held a meeting to discuss the bonus planning needs for commercial and commercial support analysts now that they have been combined into one program under the a / a program umbrella .
i was asked to put together some information on how bonuses in 1999 compared between merchant service analysts , commercial analysts and commercial support sr .
so that we could determine if there would be a 2000 bonus compression problem in analysts being placed in commercial support positions and then having lower bonuses .
attached below you will find the results of that research .
the data above is being sent to help you understand the concepts we discussed and put closure to the meeting .
the 2000 bonus planning system allows for a variation within analyst categories ( commercial and commercial support ) and will meet the business needs .
please let me know if you want to discuss further or would like to see the raw data used in the research .
walter , please could you send me any information you have relating to the precise legal nature of this entity .

this line of thinking would appear to favor the super majors , although smaller players may have more to gain and thus more to offer .
ironically , enron has pulled out of dolphin just when the project looks certain to go ahead .

under the proposed decision , qwest would be able to recover $ 17.6 million of its revenue requirement through a combination of rate increases and decreases .
the proposed decision would provide that qwest 's " fair value rate base " for the test year ending dec. 31 , 1999 , is about $ 1.4 million , and a reasonable rate - of - return on that base is 9.61 % .
the alj recommended deleting one provision ( section 4(g ) ) from the settlement that would allow qwest to attain flexible pricing for all services offered within a particular wire center , provided there were other competitors within the wire center .
the alj said the provision could open the door for qwest to price a competitive service " very aggressively " in a targeted area but be able to price the same service or package much higher in areas where it does n't face competition .
under the proposed decision , basket one services could be combined with other services and placed in basket three , provided that the basket one service remain available as a basket one service .
private or public organizations could donate computers that would otherwise be discarded .
sb 1180 also would allow the commissioner to form an agreement with the department of correction whereby inmates would help restore the computers .
the state could purchase any necessary computer parts or tools , or these items could be donated .
for each category , the carrier should present a detailed description of the costs involved together with a dollar amount of the costs associated with the category .

earlier in the year , pge has accumulated the length for the 2001 - 2002 period that appreciated in value significantly as prices were increasing .
in my opinion , the following factors have affected pge 's decision to maintain the length in a bearish market : - bullish or not as bearish sentiment among traders - reliability issues : pge has significant political and financial repercussions for being caught short in a blackout - psychological fears of tight power supplies and potential blackouts / brownouts , mainly because of recent situation in ca
pge could begin discussions with the puc on the structure of a new pca mechanism to limit their risk and rewards ; or move towards greater deregulation .
in retrospect , it would be helpful to analyze the value of the long position against the cost of reliability and make a decision accordingly .
continue to improve trading controls ( missed a deal earlier in the year resulting in a $ 10 mm loss in the spec book ) .
input / coordination with ews on important trading decisions .
insights from the west desk could help pge make better trading decisions .
i would be glad to provide additional details .

just between you and me , i 'm astonished -- delighted but astonished , that they fugured their way through all of those japanese holidays and the aftermath .

our local pr firm has suggested that we translate the basic eol brochure into japanese .
we are moving forward with this .
i do not expect to require any further localization at this point .
given the comments below , could we move the roll out to 10 - 12 may ?
i would recommend that we shoot for may 10 or 11 ( which would conflict with possible high profile participation in an apec meeting , which i 'll be managing ) or preferably the week of may 15 .
we could introduce eol earlier , but publicity would be reduced given rebecca 's schedule for interviews and lead time for printing / mailing promotional packets .
it would be very tight , but we could do it the week of april 24 .
rebecca could provide overview interviews , supplemented by an eol demonstration and your explanation of how this provides a platform to build our business .
i think rick buy liked it this week , and hopefully this will lead us to more conclusions / trends than just reporting incidents that appear random .

louise - just wanted to give you an update on where we stand with this company : as you read from tommy 's due diligence summary there are numerous issues with the technology , but the collection of realtime capacity offers / awards , critical notices and historical database does have value for enron .
the price we are willing to pay to capacity center to provide the operational services needed to run the system ( for one year ) 3 .

further to our recent announcement that we will be hosting a cocktail party at the famous pat o'briens on the river at the end of the first day , sponsored by bloomberg , we confirmed yesterday that enron will also be chairing the conference - find out more here :
2001 eyeforenergy is pleased to announce that enron will be chairing the upcoming conference on energy trading in new orleans , energy exchanges online ii :
from september 10 - 11 , energy traders will be meeting in new orleans to discuss the latest developments in online trading .
we 've had a bit of time to take stock of the fall out from deregulation in places like california and new york .
in addition , it looks like the shake down among the online exchanges is about to go through another round .
i think it 's an ideal time for energy traders to take a good , hard look at who they 're working with and make sure that they 've got the right partners .
perry - we lost you on the original e - mail but definitely need your involvement .
we would like to discuss how to get this changed within the 15 day timeframe that we were given .
as you may know , a group has been convened to develop an industry contract to trade gas .
i have asked them to reconsider this decision and to take the opportunity to " update " the gisb , hopefully , in a manner that could be used cross - border .
i have explained that most of our counterparties supplement the gisb with their own special provisions and we could use these supplements as a starting point for creating an industry standard gisb " update " that could be used cross - border .
in this regard , would you please send me a copy of your company 's special provisions so that i can forward them to ian anderson in canada .
also , would you please put me in touch with someone in your organization that might be interested in participating in this effort .
i think it would be very helpful for the canadians to hear about our experience with gisb and gas trading in general in developing an industry standard contract .
thank you so much for your help on this .
questar is looking at alternative uses for the california portion of the approved interstate pipeline .
it definitely does n't go far enough to remove the obstacles in the way of developing new pipelines in southern california .
we 're at the point where we 're not going to stop trying to market capacity on southern trails , but we 're definitely at the point where we have to consider some alternative uses for the california portion ( of the 700-miles , 16-inch - diameter pipeline ) .
thus , we 're still looking for a large customer who would be willing to break the gridlock in southern california in the name of promoting competition .
the east - of - california portion of the southern trails pipeline is already fully subscribed and will start operations mid - year next year , jones said .
i think it is important to get something out and i believe that people expect some changes thanks , m.
thanks for the kind words , vince .

as for the pooling revisions , dynegy expressed reservations about the proposed changes that included substantial increases in the number of pools available per shipper . ?
dynegy was not able to garner internal approval in time for us to prepare the errata for filing later today , so pooling revisions were taken off the table . ?
since i was unable to get resolution from all of the parties of the outstanding differences , i could not include the revisions that were circulated ( to our dismay ) . ?
for comments on the proposed decision and lobbying on this specific case , i 'm willing to go straight hourly basis , but i will continue to request fixed prices going foward .

we could stop by after christmas shopping if you want .
i think it would be a nice gesture to the parents that previously had kids enrolled there to be able to bring their child(ren ) back instead of having to enroll them into another daycare .
i understand that i will not be able to pay $ 560 a month since enron will not be subsidizing , but it would be nice if enron could lower the rate to $ 600 per child .
enron kids is a wonderful place with wonderful teachers .
it would be very important to several parents if they could have their child(ren ) back downtown at the same daycare .
your schedules are very full so i went ahead and spoke to mark f. about the drift budget for 2001 and my thoughts of keeping drift as a consolidated number ( including europe ) .

i 'm not sure about the legal effect of " signing under protest " in this context but can do some research if you think that useful .
in any event i think that the letter should recite more of the history of this negotiation and the early agreements or representations that are now modified .
but we should try to have as clean a record as possible if we think that we may have to seek relief .

the state agencies responsible for ensuring the reliability of the electricity grid are phasing in customer changes more slowly than first planned to make sure texas is n't beset by errors that could cause the type of power outages routine in parts of california .
the delay wo n't mean much in practice ; -- customers who switch to a new provider probably will get their first new bill in august rather than july .
we want to be fast , but we insist on getting it right .
the new ercot system is expected to be able to handle about 21,000 customer switches each day by july 6 .
switching a customer to a new provider should take about two weeks .

thank goodness he does n't have to be elected in florida .
what he does over the next six months will determine how much the economy slows and what kind of stock market we 'll have over the next four years .

staff writers assemblymen wait for late session on the rescue plan for the state 's utilities to resume .
the measure would " allow us to enter into long - term contracts for electricity which will greatly reduce the cost of power in the future , " davis said in a letter urging lawmakers to adopt the bill .
lawmakers are considering a measure under which the state would issue additional bonds to help the utilities pay off their debts and in return have the public receive a stake -- through a type of stock option -- in the companies .

it requires that the reserve be spread across more units or that special control features be added to agc to allow carrying more reserves on some machines .
as dick indicated in his note , there is some potential for a reduction in system transfer capability .
on the other hand , when more generation comes on - line in california with new construction , then the reserve levels rise and the impact on transfer capability is mitigated .

if you have additional questions , i will dig deeper .

while significant differences remain between the united states and chile over the details of the deal , the administration has stressed the importance of moving toward the establishment of a free trade area of americas , and the chilean pact would help advance that effort .

cox said the new spending should be focused on land kept in production rather than idled in the conservation reserve program .
the increased spending would require a " dramatically expanded " natural resources and conservation service staff to provide technical services , he said .
a larger administrative staff also would be needed to analyze the stewardship " contracts " farmers would have to take out with the government to get the money , cox said .
the proposal envisions large - scale assistance to ranchers with grazing land and to growers of specialty crops .
the interesting fact is that if we add up what the majority of groups asked for in the commodity title , plus what most groups have asked for or are going to ask for in a conservation title , we will have already spent more money than was budgeted for the entire farm bill , " lucas said .
he said the congress would have to grapple with energy issues in a way that is " much more significant than any of us thought .
he said democrats were interested in using the tax code to encourage conservation -- but did not say how they would offset costs of any tax credits the energy bill might include .

leading european and us banks want more information on how new rules on capital adequacy will operate , raising the possibility that final proposals from the basle committee could be delayed .
they are also asking for more information on the way operational risk - unexpected losses - will be treated , and for details on aspects of securitisation , counterparty risk and disclosure .
the letter points out that in a number of important areas the basle committee 's second consultation document has either come up with new proposals or indicated that final proposals are to come .
" taken together these greener areas will have a critical impact on the outcome of the proposals for individual firms and the industry as a whole , " the letter says .
we are very concerned that if the calibration is not done properly , that will go up and it could have a serious effect on the economy , " the european banking federation said .
the basle committee last night welcomed the banks ' feedback but expressed confidence that the year - end timetable would be maintained .
while good progress is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk management and regulatory oversight of highly leveraged institutions ( hli ) , credit providers need to make further improvements in the measurement of credit exposures , a global banking watchdog said friday .
although a separate study that looks to set out a basis for improvements in public disclosure of financial risks has been completed , actual progress toward introducing mandatory public disclosure requirements for hlis and hedge funds has been limited , the fsf report said .
at the same time , improvements have been made by senior management in terms of reporting on hli exposures , general standards of credit analysis , due diligence and documentation , the fsf reported .
and foreign exchange market participants have agreed to a set of so - called good practice guidelines for foreign exchange trading .
this would help address concerns that large and concentrated hli positions could have the potential to materially influence market dynamics in small and medium - sized open economies , according to the fsf report .
while progress is being made in addressing weaknesses in legal documentation practices , it has proven difficult to achieve improvements in the consistency , where appropriate , between different industry standards , the report added .
while good progress is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk , management and regulatory oversight of so - called highly leveraged institutions ( hlis ) , credit providers need to make further improvements in the measurement of credit exposures , the global banking watchdog said .
disclosure of information by hlis to banks and other credit providers has improved in terms of both quality and quantity , the bank for international settlements said last week .
the banks said they feared the legislation would discourage international investors from trading in hong kong shares , undermining the sar 's position as an international market .
however , they will need to do so under the new law as it expands the disclosure requirement from shares to include derivatives .
the stricter disclosure requirement [ in the bill compared with ] international practices would be needed for hong kong to reduce manipulation activities , " she said .
updating the netting provisions to include a wider range of otc products has been a priority for the international swaps and derivatives association and the bond market association ( bma ) since the mid1990s .
in two high - profile reports in 1999 by the president 's working group - one on long - term capital management and one on otc derivatives regulation - us regulators acknowledged that updating the netting law would reduce systemic risk .
the definition of swaps has been stretched to cover forward rate agreements , forward foreign exchange contracts and other instruments .
friction developed between the swaps and securities contracts with regard to netting across them , " says dan cunningham , a partner at allen & overy in new york and isda 's legal counsel .
contracts will have expanded collateral and an array of products to provide for safe harbour " netting and settlement will be much faster and more efficient under the new bill , he adds .
the organizations sought the overturn of a decision rendered late last year in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york .
the three groups contended that because a wide range of factors can affect the market price of a futures contract , the imposition of ' " any continuing duty to furnish all price information and information of all facts likely to affect the market price would be so burdensome as to be unreasonable .
the narrow scope of a broker 's duty to a nondiscretionary account under new york law applies fully to a futures broker , the groups wrote .
the eurobond market was a response to a new withholding tax on interest payments to overseas investors in dollar bonds .
at the start of 2000 , outstanding otc derivatives amounted to $ 2,800bn according to the bank for international settlements , or just over half the value of all outstanding international debt securities .
could there be a limit to the efficiency gains that can be wrung from the global financial system through innovation ?
newer instruments such as credit derivatives are growing fast , although central bankers worry about their robustness in a downturn .
while portfolio regulations for private pensions will encourage regulatory arbitrage via derivatives , the scope for innovation is less obvious than in responding to floating exchange rates and financial liberalisation .
but only a visceral optimist could assume that financial innovation will continue at the pace of the past quarter - century .
airlines , especially those concentrated in a particular hub , could use weather derivatives more actively since inclement weather can prompt many more delays than they are used to , notes claudio ribeiro , head of new products development , weather risk management group , enron .
the way to do that is by entering into swaps and options with limits .
weather has n't presented itself to - date to be sufficiently fungible for us to build a broad market on , yet it 's a pretty big market nonetheless , " adds robert levin , senior vice - president , planning and control development , at the new york mercantile exchange .
since september 1997 , when the first weather derivatives trade occurred , the market has experienced an estimated 4,500 weather transactions worth more than us$ 6bn .
through the otc market , we can create any kind of structure , " ribeiro says .
to compensate , a realistic hourly weather simulation engine is needed that could replicate thousands of multi - regional weather scenarios , said rookley .
initial hopes were that the treasury 's move a fortnight ago would prompt the societies to embrace synthetic securitisations - and thus help fuel credit derivative market growth .
on closer examination , those hopes seem to be fading .
also , the assets suitable for synthetic securitisation are relatively small , " said chris carman , a vice - president within jp morgan 's structured products group in london .
while some smaller building societies may be candidates for synthetic securitisations because they are cheaper and require less documentation than traditional securitisations , others may not have concentrations large enough to warrant the use of synthetic securitisations .
the smaller building societies that may be viable candidates for synthetic securitisations , may not be able to build the infrastructure required to otherwise actively trade credit derivatives , noted janet tavakoli , executive director and head of structuring and engineering for credit derivatives at westlb in london .
building societies would need to be securitising an asset pool of more than e500 m to warrant entering into the transaction because the cost of putting together these transactions is quite sizeable , other industry officials said .
a building society 's ability to use credit derivatives hinges on where it fits on a bsc - created spectrum that assigns eligibility based on criteria such as sufficient experience in using derivatives and adequate systems to capture and handle credit derivatives business .
an institution ranked in the middle of the five - tier spectrum will have to apply and to make a strong case for why it should be able to use credit derivatives .
building societies are most likely to use synthetic securitisations in new product areas as a way to transfer out the risk related to a new product or for transferring the risk of higher - weighted assets , industry officials said .
the changes enabling building societies to use credit derivatives occurred because the bsc 's regulatory jurisdiction over building societies is being transferred to the fsa in november .
according to some industry officials , building societies ' current practice of using insurance to reduce borrower risk may turn out to be what prompts them to enter the credit derivatives market .
theoretically , credit derivatives could take the place of mortgage guarantees .
the societies have been able to use only interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives .
we continue to develop new generating capacity , which provides an inventory of future capacity sales and low - cost , high - value optionality in a highly volatile market - place , " skilling said .
audit david yeres , a partner specialising in derivatives law at clifford chance rogers & wells in new york , says : " a number of our clients have asked us to do a contract audit in response to the scrutiny management is giving to these exposures and the adequacy of the documentation .
he adds : " we work very hard at upgrading our contracts , we 're analysing our contracts in light of market changes and our experience in california .
clifford chance 's yeres expects that i the california crisis will accelerate acceptance of more - sophisticated master agreements .
for instance , you can set up any kind of structure using collateral threshold amounts or guarantees , or any type of credit support mechanism .
i know a lot of the suppliers have added quite a bit of additional language for transactions with the california department of water ,
however , the concepts contained in the eel master that are similar to those in the isda master agreement . which has stood the test of time and been proven in court .
isda itself has an initiative under way that , when complete , could benefit energy marketers operating in california .
it is looking at ways to expand its master agreement to cover both physical and financial transactions .
haedicke , who is an isda board member and chair of the energy and developing products committee looking into this , says : " it would be a much more efficient world if we could find a way to use the isda master for both physically and financially settled transactions , and find a way to net across physical and financial collateral collateral is another area being scrutinised in the wake of the california crisis .
under the concept of " adequate assurances " in new york law , a party to a forward contract with " reasonable " grounds to be insecure about the ability of its counterparty to fulfill its responsibilities may demand performance assurance such as collateral .
depending on documentation , some energy traders [ have ] been able to terminate and close - out transactions at an earlier stage than others using the so - called ' early termination events '
the costs and opportunity costs of working through this debacle should ensure that the lessons of the california crisis are long remembered .
isma said these bodies needed to work together in a constructive way to provide a more harmonised security settlement environment in europe to " substantially reduce " the number of failed transactions .
the organisation 's intervention will increase pressure on europe 's 26 different clearing and settlement systems to speed up co - operation so costs can also be reduced .

i am still optimistic a tie out can be accomplished without major changes to any systems , and the information obtained will be a diagnostic tool for the initiative below ( where are the problems / disconnects ? ) .
it is also an opportunity to quickly access the results of the current process , which may improve management 's opinion re the accuracy of the daily information .
dear wanda , i think a good idea would be to have a pre - kick off meeting with beth
and i first so we can discuss what is currently taking place in regards to grmo initiatives in this area .
we ( sally , bob , beth , debbie etc ) had a meeting yesterday to look at the interfaces between the source systems and risktrac and make the appropriate updates .
please let me know today if you agree with this list and i will move forward getting the meeting scheduled and work on a presentation / agenda for you and beth to approve .

peggy asked that i update you on our earnings forecast for this year .
retail loads were off for the month which created additional length along with strong wholesale prices in the preschedule and real time markets .
recent downward movement in the forward curve has reduced the value of our long position in may and june on a forecast basis .
if this trend continues then we should over perform in both may and june .
for the year , we are still on track to make our plan but a similar situation to the second quarter exists for us in the third and fourth quarter .
the value of that length changes on a forecast basis based upon movement in the forward curve .
however , we continue to see the preschedule and real time market trade higher than the forward curve .
if wholesale prices in the preschedule and real time market continue to be strong then we will move into the dead band and could move into the refund zones .

should you have any questions , please call your help desk or resolution center .
thank you for your cooperation and support .
please make a few minor changes to the scal product .
we also need to take a look at the description , fixed and floating .
looks like we have exposure on the sale of cgas despite the $ 30.2 mm being off balance sheet .
i feel strongly we will beat the $ 31.2 mm carry value .
enron has a obligation to the banks under the total return swap confirm for the $ 30.2mm plus accrued interest ( the only dif .
is there any balance sheet exposure & credit support for the $ 30.2 mm in the total return swap ?
on a related matter , i informed the cgas executive team that enron will initiate a sales process within the next two weeks and will return to columbus in mid - may with our divestment advisor .
therefore , i am confident enron will net $ 2 - 5 mm more than the sale price to cibc of $ 31.2 mm .
they have asked that we try to arrive as early as possible on may 13 so that departure on april 14 can be achieved .
please advise as soon as information is available on the progress of the work .
it is like looking at the market for new automobiles " west of the mississippi " - a pretty meaningless concept as cars are produced on either side of that artificial boundary , and are freely bought and sold across it .
i think if the leadership had not been so abysmal on this there could have been a rational deal between the ca gov't and the generators that would have solved the basic problem , kept the lights on and minimized the economic damage to the california economy and the state 's bond rating .
i should pretty much be around all next week so you can catch me whenever .
how ca gets integrated into a new rto appears to be the key question .
hi bill , i know you have been out

we will use this week to prepare for texas a&m , which i think has been underrated all year , " he said .
but he said the longhorns have improved so much that they have a chance to close strong if they keep working hard .
overall , we felt that it was a very good win for us .
we were able to play everybody that we took on the trip and came out of the game very well .
i have been amazed all year with how these freshmen play as if they are older .
brown said he has been telling the team it needs to keep winning to have a shot at a good bowl game .
that means lee will get a medical redshirt and will be a redshirt freshman next year .
dt shaun rogers played without reinjuring his ankle and should be closer to 100 % for the aggie game than he has been since early this season .
antwan kirk - hughes has been having problems with a shoulder , and it bothered him during the kansas game , but the week off should give him a chance to be ready for the aggie game .
i guess i 'm going to have to learn the hard way , but at least i 'm learning .
much like the debacle in dallas caused texas to bear down and start playing better , the loss to colorado seemed to bring out the best in a&m.
i am forwarding it on to robert jones , vp of hr for the net works group and he will make sure that it gets wide distribution for possible positions .
finally , it is easier to close a small department , and one that is sometimes ( and erroneously ) viewed as duplicating educational efforts in the economics area , than it is to close a larger and more unique department in the college .
still , there is no way of getting around the news that a wonderful educational entity that has been home to so many wonderful people and has contributed so much to education , the state of pennsylvania , and the larger world community , will soon cease to exist .
please know that our department has worked valiantly for many years to amass accomplishments that would stave off such a decision .
i only wish that i could have done more .
thanks , adam rose professor and head
both carlos and harry are pleased with her work .

i am making changes and taking out the word " trading " wherever possible and i will send you a revised copy when it is ready .
sorry that i will miss you the week of dec 18 .
look forward to catching up in the new year .

please let me know when you can meet and i will arrange the logistics .
to determine the appropriate approval level needed , add the expected overrun to the originally approved amount .
then go to the appropriate section ( ie projects not approved in the plan or projects approved in the plan ) and identify the appropriate approval level for the new total .
for example , if a capital project was approved in the plan for $ 1.8mm and it is projected to overrun by $ .2mm , the ets president can approve the overrun .
further , if the project 's new total exceeds the gpg ceo authority , the decision will be made at that level when and how to obtain approval from enron 's office of the chairman .
attached please find the following documents : thank you , gretchen - 58701

ees commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week .
depending upon the savings that ees can offer to facilities , we will determine any " headroom " for rec purchases .
michael initially projected $ 250,000 per year for the requisite number of recs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the building .
i think they 'll go for a $ 1 - 4 dollar range , bringing the cost down to a max of $ 125,000 .
next thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the premium cost for the recs ( ie how much over the cost savings will the recs cost ) .
b. pitching the idea to skilling for buyoff , and payment for the recs ; c. possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change what they are currently paying for power .
mike , we 'll definitely need your continued support and assistance , particularly if this goes to skilling .
i 'll keep you posted on the progress .
the swaption traders can now fit the first 5 - 6 years of the volatility curve to the market - observed baseload swaption implied volatilities ( typically 3 to 12 months duration for the underlying swap ) and then be in a good position to price other swaptions ( including swaptions on individual efa slots ) consistent with the curve .
there may also be an impact on the daily var calculation .
these curves will be reset as the market moves , and allow a mark - to - market approach to be followed for our volatility book .

both your positive and negative responses are essential to guide us in refining the cmr recommendation .

receiving your comments in this format will enable us to understand and respond to your input efficiently .
we will also post this template at under the heading " congestion management reform recommendation - draft .
in the second section , please provide detailed comments on specific sections of the proposal using the template provided .
since section 6 is an overview of the proposal , we have not included a comment section in the template for that section .
we would like to emphasize our need to receive your comments on features of the proposal that you like .
reviews can tend to focus on features with which reviewers are dissatisfied .
without hearing support for features that stakeholders like , it is possible that some broadly supported features could be changed or eliminated , based on others ' stated disagreement .
there will be other opportunities for feedback , but we would like to include a summary of stakeholders ' initial comments in our discussion with the iso governing board on august 1 .
the california iso greatly appreciates the time , effort and expertise stakeholders have contributed to the cmr process .

and we will meet when you are ready .

happy new year to you from your friends at
check out the clean new look at http://www.audioc.com january through may is traditionally our busiest time .
we sincerely hope that 2002 will prove to be a wonderful year for you and all those you care about .
we hoped and desired for our 1st customer - now 25 years later our customer numbers are in the 30,000s and aiming to 40,000 .
but like any 25 year old - we still have much growing and learning for the future .
we hope you 'll continue to grow and learn with us in 2002 .
we 're hoping it will be a great year for our country , for our world , allies , and freedoms , for you and for us .
darron from all of us at aci , may your next year be more pleasant , safe , and fruitful than the last .
well you are gon na have to work out for 2 hours a day .
i want you to stay in top shape .
if it is real estate development i would like to look into it .
i want to see what type of work it is .
i would add that i told them that their role would need to be defined by you , the developer , and technical support .
looks like we are going to try and get this accepted by aa as is .
everything looks good except the recallable factor .
to follow - up with some other thoughts -- 1 .
jeff used the fasb - sec model as an example of what a good relationship could look like .
should just be a standards organization .
jeff explained that the pjm version has a more likeable approach than the nerc version , pjm 's is less prescriptive and relies more on ferc participation in establishing a " sro " .
jeff also would like to make a presentation ( as soon as possible ) to the nerc board of trustees of the key items enron would like to see resolved that would provide enron enough confidence that the nerc / naero organization would be independent enough from the stakeholders and be willing enough to tackle the industry 's toughest issues concerning competitive markets in electricity .
i will be working with the enron - nerc team on a breifing paper of what we want nerc to fix in current nerc rules and processes for nerc to demonstrate it is worthy of the " sro " status .
barry - i 'm not in the office today ( logging in from home ) but will be in tomorrow .
the hr organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population .

since earnings season ended , sentiment about b2b stocks has shifted back to the rose - colored variety in this sector .
but in a possible indication that investors may have just been reaching for any b2b stock , ventro finished up $ 2.69 , or 21 % , at $ 15.50 on no news .
on top of that , covisint , the big auto exchange that commerce one is helping build , is setting up to launch near the end of september .
ready to bolt gavin mlinar , an analyst at sands brothers , says the stock has been setting up for a move for a while .
september is a big month for them ; they have so much on the table for a potential lift , " mlinar says .

tomorrow we will be having a quick 15 min phone conference to update mike hutchins on status ( greg whalley will not be able to attend -
barbara , i think i let you know that ken will not be able to participate .
vince , i have received a call from mit asking if enron would be interested in sponsoring a financial engineering pro - seminar .
with a current mule price of $ 42 in tehran , enron could offer a linked mule swap double derivative tied to the gap between the price of mules delivered in kabul on a given date and the price in tehran on the same date .
sure , you would rather have the quick - and - clean iran sale , instead of the sale in kabul that requires trucking the mules to a foreign market .
but even if you add in $ 4 per mule for transport through militia - held territory and averaged the markets together , you can still clear eight bucks just on the gap alone .
but based on the amazing $ 12 kabul / tehran trading gap , they can easily put together a " delivery in either market " contract that will allow them to ask $ 36 per mule on their mule online internet trading system .
things are not looking good in that part of the world , either .
i believe the cows found me very odd ... they stared at me alot ( as you can see ) .

i was not able to learn when he would be in the market to buy , but i encouraged him to give me a call if he wanted a price quote .
if they do need energy i expect they will keep the term short and shop it pretty hard .
please do not hesitate to call if the situation changes and you need a electricy price quote for a structure you are working on .
our hope is that this new framework will be successful in moderating electricity prices .
we are very pleased with the opportunity the commission has given us to review and comment upon this report , and look forward to providing our comments on november 9 , and throughout this proceeding .
we welcome thoughtful intervention to repair the market .

george , we are pretty sure dealbench is the cheapest in the market place - we are way below others for costs .
as you know , we have used dealbench as our auction platform since inception and have been very pleased with the results .
i would suggest that the more prudent approach is to determine the aggregate demand for such services and to utilize gss to contract and manage a third party service / auction platform for corp. and the commercial business units .
therefore , the question going forward is if several business units in enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002 .
if a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon , that would be great .

jason , after our brief discussion last night i think i should discuss a few of the issues i have with respect to calculating a var on the deal that you are proposing .
the var model , as i illustrated , is set up to accept a term structure of delta positions , prices and vols and it may be difficult to translate the ' silver mine ' position into these inputs .
to do this properly i would need to understand fully how the deal is priced as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in mtm in the future and that is essentially what var is supposed to predict .
if you need me to work on this then you need to contact steve who will help to prioritise my time .
rac will also assist in the process .
please contact me if you have any further questions ,

also contained is a brief discussion of current fcc proceedings , what we are doing to be better informed and some suggested actions .
the biggest take - away from the meeting was that we impressed upon them the effect the issues before them ( eels , access to high capacity circuits ) will have on carriers entering the market who want to provide high - speed data and content services to large customers , as well as to the development of a bandwidth trading environment .
they seemed interested in enron as different than most carriers .
they also informed us of an eels task force at the fcc , with whom we will make contact within the week to arrange a meeting .
we will be doing some background on whether we will want to file in conjunction with other groups or singularly .
we will definitely be soliciting your feedback on the substance of the comments .
we will keep you informed of important developments .
the focus may be the disparity in pricing between unes and special access service .
we will monitor this proceeding for opportunities to weigh in as well .
finally , we expect the industry analysis division to come out with report about the penetration of internet access in the us .
this may be of interest , but may not require any involvement .
please note that paul has indicated that he 'd like to hold the weekly staff meeting & conference call this week on friday , may 11th at 8:30 am pst .
the visit seems likely to showcase the clash between two very different energy strategies and political strategies .
a series of recent polls show that roughly two - thirds of californians believe mr. bush should be doing far more to help the state , though it is unclear exactly what kind of help they have in mind .
so mr. bush 's aides have been struggling for days to choreograph the two - day visit here , trying to find ways to differ with mr. davis without seeming callous about the problem or in conflict with the state .
energy secretary spencer abraham issued an order of chiefly symbolic importance , saying his department would move quickly to determine whether investors were interested in financing and co - owning a new transmission line that could bring more power to the state . '
the level of interest will be a factor in the decision to build the line later this year , ' ' the energy department said .
it said that it would proceed with studies of how the land could be acquired , by eminent domain if necessary , and that it would speed ahead with environmental reviews .
later he will give a trade speech in los angeles , underscoring the message that if california hopes to remain the world 's greatest exporter of high technology -- if it were a nation , california would be the world 's sixth - largest economy -- it must find new ways to produce and deliver electricity .
already , leading silicon valley companies are threatening to build their next - generation chip fabrication plants elsewhere , probably in texas , which has a surplus of generating capacity , a move that would further undermine mr. davis 's stewardship .
if we had thought that we could drive up prices ... we certainly would not have hedged , " eads said .
industry analysts say enron may be willing to reduce the power tariffs if it can find other buyers for its electricity .
indian state officials said another meeting of the panel will be scheduled for later but no date has been fixed yet .
` ` we will play an active role , ' ' in solving the payment dispute , he said .
` ` we will take into account interests of all sides . ' '
we are negotiating on the various issues that are coming in the way of the project , " he told reporters , adding that no date has been fixed for the next meeting .
mseb began buying the 740 mw of power produced by the the project 's first phase in may 1999 , but late last year , it started to default on payments saying the tariffs were too high .
prime new energy ( www.prime-new-energy.com ) said net asset value per share stood at 105.59 swiss francs on may 25 , having set a year high of 106.66 on may 22 .
a solution has to be found out which will have to be both in the national interest as well as acceptable to the investors ... by asking national thermal power corporation to buy power we ca n't have a solution , " he said .
he said there was hope that dpc 's tariff would come down at rs 3.50 per unit after lng use .
geb , which has been facing severe financial crunch for the past few years , will now be worried only about current power purchase bills raised by ipps .
thanks to subsidy payment arrangement in cash on monthly basis facilitated by gujarat electricity regulatory commission , geb now has some liquidity to pay current bills of ipps and so ipps are worried only about the past dues , said sources .
the project is being built at a total cost of $ 2.9 billion , of which $ 2 billion has been funded through loans .
del has said several companies , including its other partner in the project , france 's totalfinaelf , were interested in acquiring enron 's stake .
the plan perhaps was to get some cosmetic changes in tariff and give dpc large benefits such as sales tax exemption for naphtha ; reduction in interest rates of loans ; and third party sales in the hope of getting the centre to make ntpc and other central utilities buy the costly power .
this would look as if the contract has been renegotiated to ease the burden on maharashtra when in fact the burden would have been distributed among several states and the centre .
to win local support and support of the authorities , and contribute to the general improvement of conditions , and contribute to the general improvement of conditions in the area " .
together , these two modern and thrusting companies , soon to be merged , have 6,000 megawatts of generation capacity - 12 per cent of italy 's active production capacity .
projects coming on stream will take that share to about 22 per cent within three years .
much would have gone to montedison , but it may go elsewhere if edf is seen to be in control .
it will also have to put a further 6,000 megawatts , or 6 per cent of production , up for sale later this year as a condition for eu approval of the enbw purchase .
the eu 's commission would dearly like to be able to agree .
commission president romano prodi , a former italian prime minister , uncomfortably admits brussels needs to study what can be done about companies which can buy but can not be bought .
in practice , however , the italian and spanish reactions may be rather more effective at concentrating french minds than lectures from brussels .
after all , a little competition at home may be a relatively small price to pay for the success of an international expansion programme intended to ensure half the company 's sales are generated outside france by 2005 .
perhaps most significant , bush has agreed to meet with davis - at the governor 's request - to discuss their differences over how to resolve the energy crunch .
the consolation prize of minority whip may be opening up .
the chads will stay in kern county for now , since the county found that buying new optical scanners would cost more than its entire annual elections budget . . . .
supporting the term - limited brown for his final two years could pay dividends later .
he would need to establish formal residency in houston to run .
if bell or sanchez wins , defeating either could prove difficult after one term , when problems can still be blamed on the predecessor .
everyone involved will be keeping a keen eye on the polls .
when president bush arrives in california today for the first time since taking office , he will engage gov. gray davis in a private discussion that could become the domestic equivalent of a peace summit .
as tends to be the case with summits , solutions are likely to be elusive , progress incremental .
on the next release ( mid august ) we will add a drop down on the storage deal type which will be a required field .
someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will be a required field - physical facility or synthetic .
( we can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to be converted - as well as results for global conversion )
in the interim time , you may want to identify your synthetic vs. physical storage deals .
re : fw : ena contracts going to aep kathryn , thank you for killing deals 809775 and 809797 , however , deals 812932 , 812937 and 810384 still have a status of validated .

under the current process , enron would need to contribute approximately $ 45 million in equity in the final capital structure of the project assuming the indicative offer we have from perez companc .
commercial operations : upon the completion of testing of the eight unit next week , we are planning to declare the start date under the petrobras agreement such that we can begin receiving the guaranteed payment .
the conflict created with this action is that this could create problems with westlb under the construction financing vehicle .
however , we were presented an offer to buy a used unit with significantly better economics and operating conditions than the lease .
with our current status in the budget , we believe that we can accomplish this and still be under the original construction budget as outlined in the attached table .
we are currently expecting to receive a $ 6.8 million tax rebate , we have been able to defer $ 2.5 million in expenditures contemplated in the original budget ( still included above ) and we have unallocated contingency of $ 4 million .

they may be saying similar things , but the calculations could be entirely different .
tom , thanks for your message .
i shall be glad to attend the meeting ( of course a lot may happen between now and then and we may have many unexpected developments in a company as dynamic as enron ) .
i want to get back to you at some point with comments on your paper .
a colleague and i are hoping to have a panel discussion on energy securities for the coming eastern finance association meetings ( april 25 - 28 , 2001 in charleston , south carolina ) .
i was wondering if you or someone you know at enron would be interested in participating in such a meeting .
i realize that you may not be able to plan this far in advance and would certainly not be offended in the least if you can not participate .
we already appreciate you taking time out of your schedule this past semester to visit lsu .
i hope all is going well and wish you continued success in your ventures , tom arnold
although there are several options , i 'm primarily interested in developing a deeper understanding of enron 's market philosophy .
brad hitch , who i worked with over at enron international , suggested i contact you to discuss your needs as well as new developments in your group .
he thought you would be in an excellent position to assist me with my decision .
as you will see , i have a significant amount of investment banking , and financial industry experience .
i know how busy you must be during this time of year , but i would appreciate a few minutes of your time .
please leave a message if i 'm not in , and i 'll return your call the next day .
if i can get an apartment friday i 'll probably try to fly standby and come back earlier sat .
i do n't normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance .
if you do , something good will happen ...
you will boost another woman 's self - esteem .
i 'm glad that you are promising to come tomorrow night !
i really apperical your help on this stuff and can not thank you enough .
the rest of the week if you have any questions .
thank you for you help isabel elizabeth l hernandez 09/11/2000
president vicente fox recently announced that the cfe would increase the capacity that industrial generators could sell back to the national grid .
the success of the program will depend on three factors :
i just want to thank your for all your efforts during my application to enron last year .
even if it did not work out in the end , but i still appreciate all your help .
i just started my new job at " allegheny energy global markets " in new york city , the company is the trading arm of allegheny energy , and used to be merrill lynch 's energy trading group .
again , thanks for the help , i look forward to talking to you in those conferences in the future .
if anyone has comments on the draft , please send to my attention asap and i will compile a final document .
please email back your take on the regulatory risks in the morning .
overall , i was pleased at how well the interfaces worked today and how fast the sap and unify teams responded to our issues .
as we get bids for project jose , we should keep him informed but move forward with getting the competitive bids .
eecc 's role and mission several developers in your groups have asked questions recently concerning the future of eecc and whether eecc would be there for them in the planning process for future enron turnkeys .
but there 's some uncertainty in their minds whether or not we 'll be allowed to do the project .
lou pai and i have briefed jeff skilling as part of the 2001 budget process and obtained his approval for eecc to continue with the following role : eecc will manage enron 's technical and engineering risk for large asset construction projects .
eecc will leverage its approach to technical engineering and construction risk management to develop new products and services , for example , lender 's engineering due diligence , etc .
eecc will develop an enron construction risk book for all enron projects , including nepco .
( this process is underway with the help of rick buy 's group and should be completed by mid - december . )
i 'm beginning this transition by moving the enron brazil projects and their project teams under the nepco umbrella .
however , nepco can not manage the arcos project in spain , which has already begun engineering , and i will grandfather arcos ( and probably the second project in spain ) inside eecc .
i would like to continue working with your teams to continue looking for the best deal for enron on every project , whether that 's an eecc / nepco epc or an outside epc .
i think we expect to manage the outside contractors when a decision is made that the best choice for a particular project is a third party contractor .
should you have additional promotion nominations , please address them to gina corteselli on the pep prc team , and they will be incorporated into the materials for the upcoming prc meetings .
we would appreciate receiving additional nominations no later than close of business 4 january .
forward confirmation sara : i attach a copy of the confirmation with the trade details for the two outstanding transactions .

both utilities have said they soon will become unable to continue buying power for their customers if the situation persists .
the failure by the cpuc to act in a prompt and constructive way around these two issues could result in the utilities ' ratings being downgraded to below investment grade .
a rate increase and long - term contracts with independent generators at prices they can afford under new rates .
but the company can purchase five - year supply contracts at about $ 78/mwh currently , which it could do with a mere half - cent increase in rates .
still , pg&e could pick up five - year supply contracts at about $ 83/mwh .
the governor 's staff needs to find out the details on the substantial long - term deals pg&e had the foresight to sign back in october .
the governor 's staff may also look at the unexpectedly high profits from sce 's and pg&e 's nuclear power plants .
-- some observers now believe that troubled california utilities edison international and pg&e corp. will get some relief at the start of the new year after state regulators at least opened the door to electricity - rate increases the two utilities said they need to stay in business .
hopefully , the financial community will take the commission action seriously enough to wait until dec. 27 and 28 to make a decision on our credit rating .
standard & poor 's was n't available to comment on how the puc 's action might affect its outlook for the utilities .
southern california edison , which said this week it wo n't be able to pay a power bill that comes due jan. 4 , said in a statement thursday that it will soon adopt a " cash preservation " plan that could involve layoffs and cuts in operations .
a new price is set to be established next week for january .
we hope it holds steady in january , " said smith .
we are doing everything we can .
( dow jones)--if two of california 's largest utilities file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , a move they said this week was possible , it may give the companies some breathing room to allow for a much needed internal reorganization , according to one california bankruptcy attorney .
but if the companies were to try and secure a loan , the loan would have to be approved by a judge .
but the bigger the company , the more likely the company will survive .
it may be long - term contracts and the company would be able to enforce the other part to continue doing business .
some people close to those discussions suggested that 10 percent would be a palatable rate increase , but the utilities are asking for more .
the commission will hold hearings next week , and just how much consumers will have to pay should be decided by jan. 4 .
four years ago , california agreed to deregulate its utilities with the hope that competition would lower rates for households and businesses .
if a suitable rate structure is passed by the cpuc at that time , the utilities ' banks would be more likely to consider additional funding .
legislative action remains possible over the next three months , and could impact debt ratings .
both southern california edison and pacific gas & electric have been warned by standard & poor 's that their ratings might drop below investment grade .
the dc tie is in the north and we should stay aggressive , working with the spp team to secure transmission to and from ercot .
the mou only commits us to jointly study , evaluate and fund a project proposal .
the " alaskan producers " are telling us they want to team - up with someone who can help them get the gas to the markets .
our goal with el paso is to develop a joint market assessment of where the demand for incremental supplies is needed and then develop a total project that would get the gas to the various markets .
i believe our best bet as of now is not to commit to a specific route or project ( i.e. , hoglund 's ) , but work with the producers on a total delivery system ... wellhead to city gate / burner tip .
your thoughts would be appreciated before we move too far in this direction .
i need a number where you can be reached on friday evening .

while certain roles and responsibilities are still being defined , we wanted to share with you some greater detail regarding the company 's organizational structure and management team .
mark muller continues to oversee corporate development activities and will manage all asset sales for enron going forward . ?
once enron 's management team is completely assembled and we begin to finalize the plan to restructure the company , we will be better able to communicate greater detail about the organization 's structure and how each of you will contribute to it .
we appreciate your patience as we work through this challenging , but worthwhile process .
we will need other groups to appoint a lead for their teams as soon as possible ( i will work with evan , legal , and product development to find out the appropriate people ) .
i fully concur with rogers that within all new product development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity .
as important , just because we do n't want to attract new business in a given market does n't mean that our responsibilities have ended .
we need to ensure that our product development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long - term .
to ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations , i would recommend that gloria be on the product development sign - off sheet .
in addition , we have already begun reviewing obligations , etc . for our current market activity ( both wholesale and retail ) .
i will talk with gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced .
i will call you to provide an update on the market review when i have more information .
if you want to talk about this , please call .
thanks , jim ps - i 'll ask gloria to give you an update on the il bonding status .
this is a market entry requirement and should be documented by product development / services upon entering new markets .
will follow up and make sure they are pulling this together .
i have refused to sign any new products until product development can prove the above exists - even for markets where we are already doing business .
i 'd like to have this pulled together within a week .
also , rogers , could you forward to me the status of the bond requirement referred to below- thanks .
other conclusions : conservation will reduce demand on the infrastructure , improved coordination between electric and gas operations can enhance reliability , and the cpuc should continue to evaluate the need for gas infrastructure expansions .

as our response is due on 4/20 , i would appreciate your earliest response .
we thought it may be useful for us to set out in writing our advice in relation to a number of the issues that we discussed at the above meeting and conference call .
on that basis , please find below the following advice on the following issues : 1 .
the legal and privacy statement contains important legal protections for enron that we think should be displayed at the earliest opportunity and in a prominent fashion .
there is little case law to guide us as to the best approach for ensuring that agreements formed online are sufficiently executed to be enforced by courts in england .
to improve enron 's argument that the eta has been sufficiently executed and agreed to by the counterparty , we advise that the eta be available for viewing and printing at all times through a hotlink in the trading section of the website .
we look forward to an opportunity to review the online registration form for new customers .
we also look forward to reviewing the online registration form for view only users of the website .
this process could take the form of a list of changes or double underline or other mark - up procedure .
we have previously noted that this means that an eta may continue to be in force with a counterparty that has ceased to trade or wishes to cease trading with enron .
we will seek further advice from overseas counsel on this issue .
we look forward to an opportunity to review the text and layout of the website to assess the final impact of the layout and text on the contractual obligations formed using the website .
we are currently seeking the further advice of overseas counsel of this issue and will provide further advice to you shortly .
we will provide you with a response on this issue shortly .
we hope the above provides a useful summary of our advice on a number of issues .
mark - eol is embarking on a phase iii project to update the look and feel of the site .
corp. while i plan to use the aps with 2advanced - and have already been working with them on it
, i am curious as to whether or not this needs to be a corp. contract or if i can run it through either net works or enrononline llc .
, the iso notified market participants that the iso was proposing to give market participants the ability to indicate hourly whether resources selected to provide operating reserves should be dispatched in the absence of a contingency or a system emergency .
giving market participants the flexibility to designate hourly whether operating reserves can be dispatched in the absence of a contingency or a system emergency requires changes to iso software as well as changes to the iso tariff .
in order to assist the iso in this assessment , the iso asked market participants to indicate , on an interim basis , whether resources selected to provide operating reserves should be dispatched in the absence of a contingency or a system emergency .
if a market participant elects to so designate a resource , it will be asked to provide certain operational information ( e.g. , the number of available hours of operation , minimum run time , minimum down time , etc . ) .
market participants will not be able to make this designation hourly as proposed in amendment 38 .
rather , if a market participant designates that the dispatch of a resource should be limited to contingencies or a system emergencies , the designation will remain in place until the ferc acts on amendment 38 .
the long - term solution ( as filed in amendment 38 ) , will allow for participants to make hourly elections for contingency only designation .
furthermore , to the extent that a resource has been awarded or , is designated as contingency only , and has additional capacity available , that capacity can be bid into the replacement reserve market or be submitted as a supplemental energy bid .
the reporting of specific operational data will also be required for the long - term solution for any resource awarded contingency only or .
some resources are interested in providing contingency
this information could be used in determining buy - back obligations .
we have saved any reports that we will need to use for p&l 's in o :

we have a whole room to ourselves at the restaurant so amy and alec should be fine .
i talked to grandma and she said julie would n't be able to make it
we are very appreciative to have both our parent 's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive .
however , we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self - sufficient .
we could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a mexican restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the difference .
the bottom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance .
our most important concern is that all our family and friends to have a great time .
if you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because i do n't want them to be offended

i 'm on a 2 hour conference call , so it seems like a good time to write up some of what i know .
i started working on these projects in late may , when ann elizabeth went on vacation , so i do n't have much history .
the price they are offering is less than our purchase price , and getting this settled quickly is critical to getting the plat issues so that we can move forward .
we want to extend the option past its current may 01 expiration .
that contract will be negotiated with the developer friendly part of the county , but it will need to be approved by the county commissioners .
speaking of the county , broward county has enacted a moratorium on power plant development until may 02 ( i think that dates right ) .
ben 's current plans are to get the new option and get this in shape to mothball until the tide turns .
very young project as best i can tell .
we will need a water supply agreement in the near future .
i 'm also working with ben on the sell of the project to teco ( same lawyer as the last teco deal i worked on ) .
i expect that i can still support this one since it is getting to the end .
this gives an overview of what i 've been working on in the past couple of weeks .
thanks to a change in accounting for the company 's film business , news corp. took a non - cash charge of $ 417 million , resulting in a net loss for the quarter of $ 268 million , or $ 0.27 per adr .
the network also reported higher production and marketing costs , which may explain all those promotions for the new series dark angel .
while the film studio 's cash flow almost doubled to $ 119 million , from $ 62 million a year ago -- thanks largely to the success of the movie

finally , footballguy favorite chris chambers got a start and delivered big time with 124 yards on 7 receptions .
charlie garner is a nice target too .
the bye week helped and he 's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while .
jimmy smith is a must start and keenan mccardell deserves a hard look in just about any league .
good for staley owners but not the ideal situation for mcnabb .
the giants may be without jason sehorn this week which would be big .
there 's a lot of talk about letting drew brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we would 've seen him last week if that was the case .
you could do a lot worse for a te .
quincy carter 's given me very little to make me think he 'll do much of anything .
that 's not unusual for a new qb to focus on the shorter routes of a te and it could continue .
few people expected tampa bay to start a track meet with new orleans last week
stats are stats though and brooks owners will take them any way they can get them .
kerry collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week .
their blitzing style can cause young qbs plenty of trouble but collins ' experience should help him .

with this in mind , we have approached westinghouse about resolving the dispute on the damaged generator .
third , while we may have a good claim for lds under the turbine contract , we may have to move into litigation mode to collect them .
we of course want to solicit input from both of you before we proceed too far with either montana or westinghouse .
because of this , we have written the exclusivity agreement with montana to provide that if we can not deliver the generator , we will return the exclusivity payment .
please let us know if you are on board with our approach as regards montana and westinghouse , and i will then follow up with louise on her discussions with calme .
while we hope to resolve this dispute in the context of our exiting the turbine position , there exists the potential of this going into litigation .

the small customer group is currently revising the language and i suggested that it was premature to make a decision on content and on the existence of cross benefits until we see a final draft .
most were neutral , although new energy wanted them listed and apses thought select might object .
we discussed the snipe on the envelope as well and the group came up with " important energy savings opportunities enclosed " .
we agreed that sending it to the attention of the cfo / energy manager might be our best bet .
apses indicated that the brc would need to be better developed for the website to ensure the customer has a place to include their account number and other pertinent information that is being preprinted on the brc in the direct mailer .
they would like our logo in an " eps file format " at our earliest convenience so that they can determine how much additional space will be available for the matrix .
i also requested that they include me in any future correspondence because i would be backing you up when necessary .
they 're positive that the deal should include a 5-cent charge on the sale side ; and mike driscoll said if ees still disputes this , they can call him to verify .

if you are currently an h-1b nonimmigrant in the us and you have not violated your status , such as by beginning work for a different employer , then you may likely be able to take advantage of a new " portability " provision in the 2000 amendments to the immigration & nationality act .
this allows for the new prospective employer to file an amended h-1b petition and for the h-1b temporary worker to begin working with the new employer once the petition is filed , rather than having to wait several months for the case to be approved prior to transferring to the new employer .
you should likely meet with an immigration attorney in person as soon as possible after being laid off so that you are advised of all the possible options that may be open to you .
release date : 05/04/00 new york mercantile exchange announces e - commerce venture for immediate release contact :
nachamah jacobovits ( 212 ) 299 - 2430 maria gonzalez ( 212 ) 299 - 2436 new york , ny , may 4 , 2000 - the board of directors of the new york mercantile exchange last night approved the formation of enymex , an e - commerce venture that is intended to become the premier , global exchange for over - the - counter ( otc ) forward trading and clearing of a wide range of standardized physical commodity contracts .
enymex will provide a single , internet - based interface to both the otc market and the exchange futures market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the nymex accessc electronic trading system , depending on the session .
the exchange 's vision for the venture also includes pursuing strategic partnerships through which enymex would provide clearing services to external organizations and creating a credit structure that will permit floor members to participate in otc markets .
the range of otc products offered will initially focus on swap contracts in crude oil , petroleum products , natural gas , and electricity , with some spot cash market products also offered .
although the initial geographic focus will be on north america , contracts are also expected to be offered for some european and asian locations .
exchange chairman daniel rappaport said , " the global energy and metals community has expressed a strong need for an electronic otc platform that provides an open , independent , and neutral marketplace for trading by all participants , price transparency , counter - party credit risk management , and the liquidity created by simple standardized contracts .
the combination of the existing futures and options markets with the enymex electronic otc market provides an ideal combination of e - commerce with " bricks & mortar " . ?
i will also send you hard copies for your files .
i 'll see if i can push him perhaps by telling them they can speak in houston if they join up ?

they have several books on trading within this industry that you will want to read .
you will need to call information to find out where they are .
would like to change your email address , please visit : http://info.aa.com

at the end of the call , pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible , but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues
we said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then " compare notes .
pirog said cdwr would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects cdwr 's ability to perform under the contract , most particularly its ability to pay for power .
( such an event likely would be a ca legislature or regulatory generated change ) .
right that has been offered , it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that epmi could walk from the deal ( without receiving or paying a termination payment ) up until a date certain ( september 1 and september 30 were mentioned by me as possibilities , although pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window )
pirog said he thought cdwr could work with us on that .
however , he said cdwr would be willing to consider having a downgrade event a " no ld walk right " for epmi and perhaps an event justifying epmi in suspending deliveries .
in other words , a downgrade event would be treated like an event of default , but no termination payment would be owed and epmi would have the flexibility to suspend performance .
however , when asked about the idea of a cross default out w / out a termination payment , he stated that he would like to discuss that further with cdwr .
my sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general .
i would think that the situs issue will be a big one for richard sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise .
pirog offered to provide us sample language , which we said we would look at .
also , he said it was a possibility that the california attorney general would issue the opinion on the bonds , so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from hawkins .
pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him , but need to be discussed internally with cdwr .
pirog said he would follow up with cdwr on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information .
inc. kay or kathleen , i would appreciate your advise .
david : we are very interested in working with you on a nonexclusive basis regarding the disposition of certain equipment we own .

inc. chris , the only problem i have with the ca is that i believe section 7 is in conflict with the confirming email on the commission .
other wise , i do not think that i have any problems .

hope you guys had a wonderful weekend at the dome . ?
the proposal i think we should recommend to aa is the following : opening and closing meeting with front line managers and discussion of all items , regardless of priority ratings ( high , medium , low ) report generated to the business risk managers at the monthly controller meeting in the " project doorstep " style , incorporating existing controls and observations / action steps to be taken on the critical issues ( those with a high rating ) and identify responsible person(s ) and target date follow up matrix report relating to the specific project audited in the manner consistent with the brm database indicating priority ratings ( the high issues should match the issues reported in the monthly controller meetings )
once the " project doorstep " style report presented by aa is received at the monthly controller meeting , compliance will input the issues into the second database to enable the reminder notifications to be sent to the person(s ) responsible for the action step .
in addition , a monthly progress report will be generated from compliance to the business risk managers to show the critical ( high ) issues and implementation detail , if any .
it will be imperative that aa issue final reports on the projects immediately after they have been completed and deliver the matrix within two ( 2 ) weeks after the monthly controller meetings to compliance for inputting to the brm database .
it will also be necessary for you , the business risk managers , to notify your front line personnel that they will be receiving the email notifications on action plans with specific target dates and with the expectation that the responsible persons will be expected to respond to the email with the status report of the issue .
i feel that this process will provide the brm 's the necessary information that you have indicated you want to hear in the controller 's meetings , including the candid discussions as well as provide compliance with the necessary information to maintain the database so the information is available for the corporate needs .
please send a copy to my attention at : amerex 1 sugar creek center blvd ste 700 sl , 77478 we 're looking forward to a successful implementation process , and in working toward the goals we both have for this project .
i got it from a wonderful friend in richmond , va .

they were rewritten by republican staff and cec attorneys to provide a 6-month process for a mitigated negative declaration of environmental impacts that might help those few entities that can start the process in full compliance with local rules .
the bill also includes a provision for four - month approval of amendments to pending applications providing for the installation of temporary peaking generation on sites that will be developed into combined cycle facilities within three years .

we should now ask whether mseb would be able to construct such a project in record time .
they may say enron power is not needed , but you can not even get a new connection easily .
the new state ministries are too big in size west bengals in particular .
the expenditure in lakhs it entails could exceed the total number of fire tenders under the department .
if a favourable judicial decision becomes possible , that should help mitigate the costs of winding up a truly scandalous project .
already , high prices for natural gas and electricity have created incentives for producers to boost supplies .

tiga has an agreement to deliver a maximum 2.6 million tons a year of lng each year to an import terminal enron is building to feed the dabhol power plant .
` ` if they do not work out , we would have to find or make alternative arrangements . ' '
the plant is due to be completed at the end of 2002 with commercial production due to begin in 2003 .
but unless energy companies can expect a commercial return , they will not invest in badly needed new infrastructure .
this will hardly help the country to overcome the power shortages that hinder economic development .
plans for the dolphin project called for houston - based enron to work with elf , a subsidiary of france 's totalfinaelf , and the united arab emirates offsets group to develop and pipe natural gas from a block of the qatar north field .
more than a year ago those involved with the project said it could end up requiring investments of up to $ 10 billion over six or seven years .

however on that question of rate of return and 50 percent versus more i think sdg&e is a little separately situated because i do think there were some encouragement of sdg&e selling off in order to be able to merge .
the rate of return may have been lower than the utilities wanted . . .
but they wanted an up - front guarantee that they would not be second - guessed and
until we can make a market work here we must have some protection for our economy .

barton said he plans to discuss possible legislation with subcommittee ranking member rick boucher ( d - va ) after another panel is heard on march 22 , and ideas will be considered over the weekend .
there seemed to be an uneasy acceptance during the hearing that california will inevitably come up short by several thousand megawatts this summer , and the need for unpleasant temporary mitigation measures has become urgent .
she suggested that ferc 's role in siting new transmission and generation facilities ought to be reconsidered .
i am beginning to believe this may need to be changed .
ferc may need to have a greater role in the siting of new infrastructure , because shortages of generation and transmission likely will no longer be just single state issues .
i believe these shortages could become interstate commerce issues that must be addressed by the federal government .
i should know next week how long this will require .

more to the point , with virtualized storage the storage media can be pooled irrespective of vendors , size and configurations .
this opportunity for an integrated storage management console to manage the entire storage resource offers tremendous opportunities , including the ability to add , shut down or reassign individual elements within the virtualized pool without bringing down the rest of the storage system .
it seems likely that the vendors , many of whom have quite a bit to offer , might make themselves much more viable in this turbulent marketplace if they focused on some of the other benefits they are capable of providing .
in the mean time , these grey days of january and february may be just the opportunity for you to start looking into all of this .

this place looks like it has just the right combination of location ( 8,000 feet , 1 hour from dia in evergreen ) , practical meeting space , a restaurant nearby , and reasonably affordable .
and so the judge who tried to mediate those talks will recommend a plan that would generate " hundreds of millions , and maybe $ 1 billion " worth of refunds , a far cry from the $ 8.9 billion california has demanded .
but wagner 's methodology for determining how those refunds should be calculated tilted toward the power generators ' position in many key respects , hence the wide disparity between his ballpark estimates and california 's claims .
the stoppage will add to overall project cost , lay said , adding this was beyond the company 's control .
` ` we are working hard and are committed to finding a solution for investors ' ' in the project , india 's biggest foreign direct investment yet .
` ` it 's premature to say whether we will pull out ' ' of the project .

indian lenders to enron 's power project are likely to appoint a new engineering consultant to work out the cost of different alternatives to complete the dabhol power project .
sources pointed out that the enron chief had requested the government to firm up a solution within the next two - to - three months to enable the company to take an investment decision on the dabhol project .
dabhol is a difficult problem but we agreed that it needs to resolved quickly .
sources said that lay in his meeting with prabhu discussed various possibilities associated with enron 's future in the dabhol power project .
cline told reporters after the meeting that they wanted to prepare both the sides for the subsequent meeting with the finance minister .
cline said that enron 's plans with the dabhol project would depend on how the government responded to the options outlined by them .
as one of the smaller generators , nrg had " less opportunity to make it up elsewhere , " said gordon howald , utility analyst at credit lyonnais securities .
that should benefit companies like calpine , which sells its production by long - term contracts .
but those that rely on spot market sales across the country could be hit , especially if other deregulated states request similar price caps , analysts said .
but settlement talks end today , and should n't yield results soon enough to affect second - quarter results , howald said .
` ` we 've had a very productive meeting with the minister of finance .
we discussed the problems with the dabhol project ( and ) a number of different avenues to try and resolve the difficulties .
we are very hopeful that the problems can and will be resolved fairly quickly .
` ` the japanese export bank has about $ 350 million invested in the project .
` ` so you have a lot of interest here that would like to see this resolved fairly quickly . '
the second phase of the project ` ` is about 85 percent complete including the lng facility .
` ` this will add additional cost to the project ultimately and delay its start .

( sally , you 're out of the office ) , i wanted to close the loop on some of the discussions we 've all been having on doorstep .
if that is the case , we should select alternative # 1 below , despite the inefficiencies .
cons : - no real need for a 3rd level of " brains " - we just need brawn -involvement by 3 or more people in interviews might be intimidating to target personnel , may be inefficient , etc . - planning and oversight with 3 groups " in charge " is inefficient and could cause accountability question 2 )
assuming buy does not actually plan to transfer responsbility for doorstep to carson 's group , i think shona and i are leaning toward 2a - it depends on what you two think about it -
i think our staff level people would welcome the opportunity to participate and see other offices - the question is can we afford time wise for them to do so .
but if we want to train carson 's group with the idea of them eventually becoming the primary rac doorstep interface , we can do that instead .
let us know what you think so we can finalize our staffing plans .
and we appreciate your continued interest .
we , also were glad to have a short visit with you and neil .
hope paige made it home for your great meal .
we have offered to help out if needed .

re capital cost estimate : 3 . nepco is able to complete the revised capital cost estimate on the n1/n2 case by june 9th at the latest ( they 're looking at moving it up to the 5th or 6th if they work the weekend ) .
they will have a revised estimate on the n1 case by the end of next week - it looks today like the cost savings for no acceleration and winter work and being able to barge the units versus railing them , will all be worth
i 'm assuming we would take the capital costs estimate into our dash as soon as the estimate is ready and go for approval , so that we can meet schedule

if drew , jim or bob could let me know what time would be convenient , i 'll get it set up .

in tapping some of the world 's largest oil companies to help build a multibillion - dollar natural - gas infrastructure , saudi arabia is signaling that bigger really is better in competing on the world stage .
d.c. mr. diwan says the largest companies are willing to take bigger risks , have more capital and can take a longer view .
for saudi arabia , the gas projects promise to bring in foreign investment that will help create jobs for the country 's booming work force .
while oil has been off limits since the mid-1970s , when the saudis nationalized the industry , the international companies are eager to be in position should oil open up again .
after that , negotiations on terms for the three ventures will get under way ; it may be months before final agreements are signed .
chevron bid on the ghawar project and hoped to make exploration and production as well as petrochemical investments , said spokesman fred gorrell .
the project has evolved into a strong upstream and gas transportation and delivery project .
del 's chairman ahmad ali al - sayegh said new partners would be brought into the venture to transport 2 bln cubic feet per day ( 20 mln cubic metres ) of qatari natural gas by undersea pipeline to the uae and on to oman .
the first phase of the gas project has a price tag of between 3.5 - 4 bln usd .
richard bergsieker , the u.s. firm 's middle east managing director , told a news conference in abu dhabi that enron did not believe it could add much to the project in its current stage .
as the project had evolved into a strong upstream gas supply project and gas transport and delivery , we do n't believe there is a lot of value that enron can add , " he explained .
( but ) there will be another partner in the project , " he said .
starting tomorrow , we will begin negotiations with the international firms who have shown interest in acquiring a state .
del has started inviting local , regional and international companies to prequalify for five contracts between may 19 - 23 following the establishment of a technical project team to oversee the implementation of the first cross - border gas pipeline project in the middle east .
energy grps may express interest in montedison 05/21/2001
jones)- electricite de france 's ( f.edf ) purchase of 4 % of montedison spa ( i.mnt ) may soon force other large energy groups to express an interest in the italian holding company , the financial times reported monday .
the latest move is likely to further tarnish india 's poor image as a place to set up power projects .
but the banker said roping in other customers to buy the second phase 's output could be difficult to achieve .
according to the power purchase agreement between the mseb and enron , issuing a ptn would mean fixing a deadline of six months for pulling the final plug on the project . "
while the 740-mw phase i is operational , the second phase of 1,144 mw was expected to be fully operational by the year - end .
sources said the huge cost overruns had been a major deterrent in project completion .
the move triggers an arbitration process that could begin as soon as wednesday between dabhol and the mseb .
but enron 's actions are beginning to look like the first step towards withdrawal from the project , in which it has a 65 per cent stake .
the imbroglio could further deter a barely detectable trickle of foreign direct investment into india .
the enron case has the potential to become , if not another scandal , at least a blight .
( add comments from dolphin 's chairman in the second paragraph , and background throughout )
the announcement comes two months after dolphin , a venture between abu dhabi , enron and total fina elf sa , agreed with qatar to develop its north dome field , the world 's largest natural - gas deposit , and build a pipeline under the persian gulf to the united arab emirates and oman .
the development of the qatari gas field will require investment of $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion , while the pipeline to abu dhabi costs another $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion , dolphin has said .
lenders to enron 's indian unit hoping for solution ( update1 )
( adds comment from lender in seventh paragraph , fund manager comment in ninth paragraph , updates share price in last . )
he also said it was premature to comment on the impact of a possible termination of the dabhol project on the bank 's balance sheet .
` ` the banks will take a big hit on their balance sheet if the dabhol project is stalled , ' ' said deepak malhotra , who helps manage $ 88 million in assets at max india ltd. in new delhi .
the fate of dabhol , the biggest single foreign investment in india , holds the key to further overseas investment in india 's power industry .
` ` lenders will need to ensure that power projects will have a continuing ability to offer competitive tariffs , which would ( give ) incentive ( to ) the state electricity boards to dispatch them . ' ' ` ` lenders will also be cautious about accepting the demand- supply estimates in different states .

dow below is feedback from dow on the presentation that mark palmer did on 1/24 to dow 's global operations leaders .

a girl i know has it on her instant messenger with a little change , and i like her version a lot , too .
epsa has previously forwarded ferc 's press release outlining the major features of the order , along with a brief memo highlighting the $ 74 benchmark for finding forward contracts prudent and the january 2nd filing requirement for forward contract offers .
we need to consider whether epsa should seek rehearing or clarification of any aspect of this order .
the commission hopes that establishing a level at which purchases can be deemed prudent will encourage the california puc to do likewise .
these informational reports should include price , terms and conditions , and amounts .
a proposed plan is due by march 1 , 2001 so that it can be in place by may 1 , 2001 .
in addition it is critical that the california commission move quickly to provide the ious with approval of their forward purchases .
the commission went on : some parties to this proceeding argue that the prices in the forward markets will be affected by last summer 's spiraling spot prices and should therefore be deemed unreasonable .
moreover , suppliers will bargain knowing that the spot market 's size will be greatly reduced and that next summer 's spot prices will therefore not be fueled by frenzied buyers whose over - reliance on last minute purchases have forced them to bid up the prices to obtain needed supply .
in discussing plans for careful market monitoring and review of sales over the breakpoint , the commission announced plans to look at outage rates for the seller 's resources , failure to bid unsold megawatts into the real - time market , and variations in bidding patterns .
the reference to opportunity costs has been deleted from this order , apparently based on a belief that opportunity costs do n't exist in real - time .
if we can make a credible case that sellers can sell out of california into other western markets in a real - time or next - hour market , we may want to ask the commission to reconsider allowing opportunity costs as a justification for prices over the $ 150 breakpoint .
i know i need to set up it contracts in sitara .

i need to go see my cousin in boulder and could work something in around this event .
the warmest maximum temperature was 86 degrees on may 6th .
comment : i think that may of 2001 should have prompted more overall demand than may of 2000 based on the more extreme nature of heat and cool .
forecast : the forecast through june is likely to bring at least 3 and as many as 6 more days with minimum temperatures below 50 .
june 7 through 20 will likely bring fewer than 4 days with a maximum temperature over 80 and 2 or fewer days over 85 .
long range forecasts would indicate that it is unlikely that any significant stretches of heat will impact chicago through the end of june .
comment : with below to much below normal temperatures continuing for much of june 2001 - cooling load will be less than june of 2000 .
let me know if i can help more ...

sun not only guided estimates lower , from 2 - 4 cents per share , down from estimates of 6 cents a share , but the company also refused to provide any forward guidance , meaning that there is still no sign of when the earnings outlook might improve , or at least stabilize .
if there was any hope that the june earnings warning season would be an improvement over march , sun just delivered a bold statement that it likely will not be .
the word among traders is that it was the unexpectedly large addition of reserves via repurchase agreements on may 16 .
the fed began cutting rates on january 3 ; that means they could begin to hit the economy as soon as july .
but should the rest of us be responsible for them ,
below you will find the executive brief for the referenced project for your perusal .
attached to this email you 'll find
we look forward in hearing from you to further facilitate the funding consideration of this project(s ) .
thank you , mr. higgens h. hyacinthe , managing director agape funding 575 madison avenue , 10th floor new york , ny
funding stage : straight - debt funding , equity investment or a combination of both for a start - up without a financial history requiring capital for facility construction .
in order to minimize the overall risk and the time required to achieve a positive cash flow , the client company has developed a multi phase strategic production plan phase
phase i can be completed and show a profit within seven months of initial funding .
phase ii is somewhat larger than phase i and will employ its own unique proprietary technology and a separate geographical facility location .
phase ii can be completed within about twelve to fourteen month after funding and the will show a profit about two months after startup .
the recent dramatic rise in energy prices in the us has caused some generators of the spent solvents that will be the feedstock for this facility to begin using these streams for fuel .
a reevaluation of this situation is underway at the present time and the decision as to the future of this phase will be made in late first quarter of 2001 .
phase iii , although much more capital intensive than phase ii , has been separated from phase iv for several reasons : 1 .
in contrast to this , the permits for the reclamation of the hazardous chlorinated solvents , phase iv , will require between ten and eighteen months if all goes well .
the technology to be employed and the absence of corrosive compounds in the processes for phase iii will allow the equipment and piping to be fabricated out of common carbon steel rather than the exotic alloys , which will be required for the phase iv , chlorinated solvent reclamation process .
the handling of the petroleum feedstocks and products for phase iii are much simpler than the chlorinated solvent feedstocks for phase iv .
phase iv will utilize a location in the us while phase v will probably be located in the caribbean .
in addition the team includes another individual with in excess of 25 years of financial experience in banking , investment banking and financial management .
from the point of the first financial draw approximately 6 to 7 months will be required to construct the phase i plant , go through startup and be ready to commence full - scale production .
while this gas is not suitable for sale as " pipeline " quality gas it is suitable for the production of ammonia .
the client company believes that freight considerations alone will provide sufficient cost differential to insure that it can successfully sell its 50,000 tons per year of product into the local market .
the phase ii operation will face very limited competition because we have been able to identify only one dedicated facility that is doing work similar to what the client company will be doing .
this market is expected to grow about 2 % per year for the foreseeable future .
( the numbers are solid to use at project .
in the loan amount , we have add the pre - funding cost ) asset value of the client company w / facilities technology - within 18 months of initial funding
number 1 & 2 , above , can currently be obtained from uop and phillips petroleum , for example , for about a million dollars per year ( royalty or technology fee ) each .
once we have fully proven these two in long - term plant performance tests , the client company may well elect to market this technology .
mark has tried on several occasions to reach someone at talisman that could put him in touch with their lawyer with no success ?

do i need to schedule a new conference call for tomorrow ?
wi am just getting ready to leave work and head home to denver tomorrow morning for the week .
but i need to get a better paying job because i am broke .
when dan larcamp recently visited he commented that pipelines need to take a look at differences between gas and electric positions and practices .
here is a quick look at the areas that we are comparing : contracting for transportation / transmission capacity .
customers may call or fax pipeline staff to negotiate discounts , although sometimes a pipeline may post a generally available discount on the website .
dan larcamp mentioned that he feels like electric form 1s have more useful market data .
i 'm not sure we 're comparing apples and apples , as the electrics are still integrated utilities and thus the form 1 includes sales data .
but , we 'll put together a comparison nonetheless .
hopefully , the detailed comparison can be completed in the next month .
also , fyi enron government affairs is currently working on their comments to the latest oasis rulemaking and plan to use the comparison work to suggest best pipeline website practices that could be a model for oasis .
i really just wanted to alert you to this new product , especially the physical steel team .
we estimate that your order should be shipped on or before 10 31 01 .
after reviewing the relevant commercial , legal and environmental issues with the respective project managers and development personnel , enron recommends that the following courses of action be undertaken : 1 .
assuming that pgl assumes the role of buyer under the terms of the land purchase agreement executed between pgl and air liquide on 4/11/2000 and pgl plans to proceed to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing , perc and pgl should immediately begin preparation of the documents necessary to achieve the icc approval of any future transfer ( sale , lease , or alternative structure ) of the torrence south parcel from pgl to torrence power llc .
this recommendation is based upon the belief that although the torrence south parcel does hold potential value to perc and enron as a project development site , the overall viability and risk / reward profile of the commercial opportunity has not yet been sufficiently finalized .
the site ( in combination with the calumet project ) represents an integral component of developing a commercial solution to the mission energy / comed 500 mw " in - city " regulatory obligation to the city of the chicago .
the factors contributing to the recommendation for perc and enron not to proceed to closing on 6/26/00 are listed below :
the incomplete status of the overall commercial development opportunity associated with the torrence south parcel .
d. perc and enron 's desire to maintain the flexibility to minimize development costs while further developing the commercial development opportunity and associated value proposition prior to executing an icc - approved land transfer from pgl to torrence power llc .
the south parcel represents a potential power plant development project site upon which perc and enron will continue to conduct due diligence and development activities .
perc and enron shall work to develop risk mitigation strategies including land options , environmental indemnifications , and other structures which protect their respective assets and the overall economic viability of a development project on the torrence south parcel .
perc development personnel have estimated that the icc approval process could require up to 6 months ( the transfer of the calumet parcel was " fast - tracked " and took 3 months to achieve icc approval ) .
this risk could impact the viability of an ' 01 in - service date for a torrence power llc development project .
perc and enron shall work to develop a binding agreement which specifies an approval and cost - sharing mechanism for future development decisions on the torrence south parcel .
such an agreement shall also specify a formula for the sharing of proceeds associated with the marketing / selldown strategy currently under development by perc and enron for all of the chicago development projects .
feel free to contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss the above recommendations and information .
as always , thanks for your help !

i agree - he does look like a good candidate .
no industry experience but plenty of good background .
( i called him to clarify his interests : he is happy for an opportunity to use his bilingual skills , and is therefore interested in enron europe and latin america , as well as houston .
let me know if this resume looks interesting to you .
i would like to introduce myself .
i had a meeting with martha salinas and kornel rost this past weekend and they mentioned that you are looking for bilingual mba 's to help with european operations .
i have several years experience in finance and am looking for something that meets my background .

the source for natural gas capacity information and exchange come see what 's new at capacitycenter .
help us help you by filling out a survey on capacity trading .
our new research center ( check correct name and change if needed ) allows you to access that data for your own purposes .
this new release is ; easier to use has lower prices , and includes automated order processing capacitycenter .
although this may be the last ease this year , recent market moves suggest that the fed has done enough to support hopes of a recovery in h2 .
it turns out that what they really were expecting to see was something more like a formal biological assessment ( ba ) for cs 3 and cs 4 , not a biological survey report like we provided .
he said that only if we were going to have any findings of " may affect " would they maybe feel the need to get additional concurrence from the usfws .
mark , i am pleased to report that everyone has been working extremely hard to collect all of the information that has been requested ( and then some ) for purposes of the upcoming due diligence visit .
while discussing the current situation with awano and seguchi we touched upon your initial reaction to our valuation and came upon a fundamental realization .
recognizing that enron will need to review and evaluate the assumptions we have utilized i still wanted to share some fundamental numbers with you in order to put this value into perspective .
in other words , if we were to flip this project at financial close it would be worth at least this much .
looked at another way , discounting the npv back to 2001 at 15 % results in a current npv of $ 558 million , or more than $ 34 per current encom share !
these numbers may be hard to believe but we are comfortable that your due diligence will bear them out .
looking at just these two projects and placing a ridiculously low 20 % probability of success on them together with the $ 3 per share of cash on our balance sheet gives you nearly $ 20 per share current value .
this is without considering oita or any of the other many projects we are currently working on .
if enron , with all of its significant resources and experience , were to fully support encom on these two projects we believe that the probability of their success would be quite high .
( we have been receiving excellent support from the global lng group by the way )
this is also why i would suggest that we focus our immediate attention on these two projects together with perhaps the oita lng project .
i think that we would agree that reaching a conclusion as quick as possible is in all shareholders interests .
my main concern continues to be that the current infighting between enron japan and e power has limited enron 's ability to recognize 1 ) the quality and significant capabilities of the employees of e power and 2 ) the significant value that has been created through the nearly 2 years of systematic and comparative analysis of all of the potential greenfield sites in japan as well as the significant progress with respect to brownfield developments .
within the next six months we expect to be able to take off of the market nearly three quarters of the most attractive development sites in japan leaving little for the late comers to the japanese market .
we continue to hope that together we can find a way to focus our mutual energies on building value in this exciting market rather than on non - productive bickering and turf wars .
just wondering if you had an opportunity to review the csa and comment .
i 'm glad you guys like the gift .
just to pile on with the issues , i will add a few thoughts of my own for issues that we might want to consider in our november 20 comments .

all are wondering whether deregulation can work - and whether benefits can broadly flow .
the cost to go into a new area and market to new customers is so high while the return on residential customers is so low that the pursuit of residential customers just may not be worth it for non - incumbent utilities .
a fully deregulated market with large numbers of residential and small business customers participating ... remains at least a couple of years away .
you have to offer a discount and by the time you offer a discount , then the spread between the actual price and the wholesale price is too great .
the state has imposed rate caps to help ensure that residential customers ca n't be harmed by volatile prices .
while consumer groups may complain about high rates and some industry insiders may project a darker future for residential customers , other experts saythe current situation is just a matter of a newly deregulated industry experiencing growing pains .
competition should live up to its promise of lower rates for everyone , but residential customers may have to resign themselves to the fact that larger - volume users will see greater savings from deregulation than they will .
while i , too , am frustrated at how things turned out , i 'm glad your content overall with the course .
i really think that we need to get together tomorrow nite to finalize , but i do n't feel like pushing it too much .
however , you are very kind to consider my perspective on the group and project .

enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to support this j.v. texaco will be providing the scada system .
the trading , risk , & perhaps scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21st floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen center once a more permanent spot can be built out .
trading for the new jv will start in early february for march production .
i 've asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it transition and ongoing costs .
i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .
i 'm coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 .
: i 'm waiting on a call back from chris larson from facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .
there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall cubes .
data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin trading for march production .
it may be possible to get an electronic dump of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .
we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios .
i will also need to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the system security .
interface between enron 's unify pop 's application and bridgeline 's scada application : i 've asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .
this will probably mean some manual interfaces between pop 's and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is complete .
the new jv could save on communications costs by switching lrc 's rtu communication to the microwave .
accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be better defined .
we need to talk through this process to see what enhancements may be needed .
at least initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the billing for this one customer .
please let me know if you 'd like to meet on any of these topics .
hopefully this will enable us to get in contact with someone on a weekend if the need arises .
i would only use this number on the weekends as we should be able to contact someone during the week .
i will be out of the office tomorrow on vacation .
if you need immediate assistance , please contact dave hill at x34218 or pager : 888.847.2597 .

all rights reserved when the new york mercantile exchange ( nymex ) announced last may it was building an electronic trading platform , it said its enymex trading system would be up and running by the autumn .
in the event , ice launched on time last october and has since built up trading volumes and attracted new participants .
the chicago - based firm was picked to build the software connection between the trading engine , designed by start - up technology company kiodex , and the web page layout , developed by fry multimedia .
globalview is now preparing a countersuit in new york .
nymex has also dismissed consulting firm accenture ( formerly andersen consulting ) , which had helped manage the new york exchange 's transition to an electronic trading platform from the early days .
despite the setbacks , nymex continues to say that testing of the system will be complete this summer , with a full - scale rollout planned soon after .
instead , enymex will focus on derivatives , new territory for the new york exchange .
nymex has fired early shots at the ice / ipe duo , recently announcing plans to launch a brent futures contract that will compete with the ipe 's flagship product ( ec may 4 , p3 ) .
although nymex 's electronic trading system has yet to launch , the platform has already been picked by us technology consultants forrester research as one of the few energy e - trade winners .

[ w]e believe the natural gas industry could continue its bullish run for another two years or more and the next 18 months look like a ' lay up , ' " the investment banking firm said in its latest quarterly report on natural gas fundamentals .
prudential expects storage to end the injection season at about 2,660 bcf , or 11 % below last year 's level .
over the past few weeks , over 2,400 mw of new merchant capacity has been added to the grid , equating to about 480 mmcf / d of capacity .
may. in aggregate , about 7,800 mw of new summer generation load could collectively consume 1.5 bcf / d , which is likely to be diverted from storage injections .
production from the deep - water gulf of mexico is expected to add 3.6 - 4 bcf / d of new supply , " more than offsetting the deliverability decline , but shy of total expected new demand .
prudential noted that on the books is another 37,000 mw of additional new gas - fired generation capacity to be installed next year and 43,200 mw in 2002 .
electric department has a small ( 50 kw ) turbine part of the generation mix of the utility not sure they would or could resell .

first , though , we need to make sure that we all agree on the meaning of the terms that we are using .
( as for " offset , " i have been under the impression that we have been using that term to describe a deduction that may validly be made from a refund amount that i am deemed to owe another party -- particularly , a deduction occasioned by that other party 's unpaid bill from me . )
that way , we could maintain a unified front of opposition to refunds without being prejudiced in any way from seeking our own refunds if it should come to that .

epa has changed their interpretation of the e & p , t & s mact regulations that would have an impact on the registrations required in june of this year .
previously it was understood that your major source status on june 17 , 2000 would determine if you register a facility .
epa has indicated that your status on june 17 , 1999 would determine whether or not a site is registered .
for dehys regulated under the e & p mact regulations ( this does not impact the t & s mact ) , you determine your major source status by first determining if the dehys at a location exceed 10 tons / year of any one hap or 25 tons / year of all haps .
if they do you must register the location with epa .

i was under the impression that pasadena wanted to resolve some of these months as quickly as possible .
i have sent the spreadsheets for may and june to patti for her to look over before i send them to pasadena .
you may be able to help , though .

the time allocation matrix will be revised during the year if material changes in the work occur .
steve , you requested that i put together a knowledge management working group .
she did a splendid job of coordination and had great ideas of implementation .
a positive discovery was that throughout enron there are a number of efforts that are trying achieve a better situation with respect to information , communication and knowledge .
we have an operational pilot webpage with some interesting content .
i hope to continue with this project by establishing a monthly meeting to arrive to the full launch of ther program in our area a.s.a.p or whenever you set the deadline ( 2nd quarter 2001 ? )
i would recommend implementation but , perhaps due to elizabeth 's and my responsibilities we would need someone else that devotes more time to the implementation of this project .
i think it would be important to develop a working group for training within our area .
they could develop programs , ask for changes in current programs so that they are also focused to what we do .
please call if i can be of assistance .
we wish you the best in reaching your career goals and we look forward to hearing from you in the future .
thank you so much for your email .

also , scrubbed the entire body so it should be in good shape now .
today , thursday , we will refine the glossary and clear any comments from whalley , buy , glisan , etc .. - we should be wrapping up by the end of the day .
that may sound grandiose , but you 've shown that if you do n't aim high , you do n't accomplish very much .
we will need to confirm with the traders if we need to re - confirm these new deals / legs created .
- it looks like you either made changes or added legs to this deal today .
in looking at the spreadsheet that you sent , i found these to be the most incorrectly valued .
in lay speak , the new alternative decision looks like it could lead to a very quick end to the rate freeze and the associated px credit .
simultaneously , the commission will expedite its review of market valuation proceedings to determine the feasibility of lifting the rate freeze as expeditiously as possible , and to evaluate the need for reasonable rate increases .
the decision adopts the accounting changes proposed by turn as a first step in assessing the impacts of electric restructuing on cost recovery .
the commission will continue to monitor the impact on the utilities in future phases of this proceeding or successor proceedings .
this is when the utilities ' cash is expected to run out , as well as the latest there would be a final valuation decision .

the dow closed lower for the second day in a row on tuesday due to light profit taking following the release of today 's dept . of commerce nov. factory orders report for november .
consecutive closes above this resistance level will set the stage for a possible test of last september 's high , which coincides with the 38 % retracement level of the 2000/01 decline crossing at 202.52 later this winter .
however , closes below december 's uptrend line crossing near 20.52 will be needed before this is confirmed .
however , today 's mid- range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on wednesday .
closes below last week 's low of 55.20 would open the door for lower prices into mid - january .

i had a call with trena mcfarland today picking up on earlier discussions with respect to the structure for the softs business to be conducted out of london and new york ( please see e : mail of 2/2/01 for detailed discussion of the alternatives ) .
trena said that there was a strong legal preference to use ena rather than a new us corporation for the trading activity conducted out of new york , and that ectric ( or efet llc ) through eeft would be the principal for uk trading activity .
as a result of this trena is considering establishing parallel books such that , for example , the london based traders would offer prices on nybot look - alike and the nybot / liffe spread trades as well as offering prices on the liffe look - alike trades .
the trouble with this route is that there is the possibility of arbitrage since the products will have overlapping hours of trading .
the possibility of arbitrage would be restricted to those counterparties which are registered both with london and new york via eol and are thus able to see both prices with a bit of collusion - this would be most likely in the case of a global counterparty which is operating through one or more branches .
this is only a very brief summary of the discussion and the issue , because i would like to follow up in more detail in person when i am in houston next week .

one potential answer may be to allocate a de - merging company 's default protection among the newly formed companies according to the percentage of debt that each entity is allocated , said credit derivatives officials in new york .
the issue first rose to prominence last year with the question of the reference entity for credit default swaps on the uk 's national power following the company 's de - merger .
international power was eventually agreed to be the reference entity because it had to take on new debt at the time of the de - merger .

an industry comment period on new global capital rules dubbed " basel 2 " ends on thursday , but the work will just be starting for banks calculating how the sweeping changes will affect their businesses .
one reason for the haste is that the basel committee on banking supervision drafting the new rules worries an industry stalemate could delay adoption of the badly - needed new rules in some key jurisdictions .
unofficial dialogues will likely continue for a long while .
banks complain basel 2 's calibration formulae , as spelled out in a draft published in january , penalise the irb approach , saying set - asides for risky corporates , for example , could be higher than what is called for by a standardised approach applied for less sophisticated banks .
one fear is that this could lead small and mid - sized banks using the standardised approach to wind up with a disproportionately larger exposure to riskier borrowers .
supervisors are expected to work out the kinks , however , and are expected to take into account data collected by the basel committee under a quantitative impact study ( www.bis.org ) .
but now it looks as though it will be changed .
the basel committee could finish analysing these by october , and is likely to incorporate them into the finished version of basel 2 .
some private bankers worry that asking banks to set aside capital for such risk could adversely affect the burgeoning business of wealth management which in theory requires a low capital base compared to lending or trading activities .
by kathleen fitzpatrick dubbed virtual portfolios , risk measurement services that include a ' what - if ' scenario along with the more traditional kind of risk analysis are gaining in importance .
deutsche 's ' what - if positions change ' enhancement , released to clients in mid - may , includes features to determine changes in value at risk ( var ) , tracking error and surplus - at - risk resulting from a variety of hypothetical situations .
managers who incorporate the use of the client risk reporting enhancement would have a better handle on whether a particular position will better correlate a fund to an index , for example .
the current var analysis tools have already been mastered by the fund community , which is now looking for better predictors of risk .
var is tied to a particular probability at present and fails to capture an exceptional move in an index , for example , said guillaume blacher , senior managing director , pricing advisory and risk management .
more managers want to work with the numbers , rather than have a single number that comes out once a day , " she said , referring to the benefits of scenario analysis over traditional risk measurement practices .
the hypothetical scenario tools , along with the traditional var risk measurement systems , are needed by fund managers in a complementary way , stated reech capital 's blacher .
hypothetical analysis tools will assist the risk manager in deciphering what positions are needed to get back within a fund manager 's limit , he added .
he also credits the more educated investor who may be prompting the fund manager to install better risk management and reporting systems , particularly for option based funds , as fuelling the current demand for hypothetical risk analysis .
however , the current risk measurement systems can be expensive for all but the largest trading organisations , and especially for start - up funds .
the fact that these virtual portfolio hypothetical analysis tools are now available is beginning to make it easier for hedge funds to start up , according to imagine 's cannon .
with the right risk analysis tools , a hedge fund could be up and running in a week , instead of hiring an entire it staff , he said .
the fsa said the think tank -- which admits it began with negative preconceptions -- ended up with some positive conclusions .

while volatility levels dropped in the first few months of the year due to supply and demand factors , the past month has seen volatilities begin to move up again .
we would predict , with the current supply and demand imbalance , that vols would rise more significantly than they have , " he says .
the fact that vols have not risen in this way creates good value for those looking to use equity derivatives .

the convertible market continues to offer zeros with many large over night deals being witnessed .
one trader comments that : " the big buyers of convertibles believe that the arbitrage funds are very material to the market , although they would prefer them on a hedge basis with more attractive volatility .

in addition , e.on would take on roughly 7.1 billion euros in debt from powergen 's acquisition of
analysts cautioned that while the deal looks good on paper , carrying it out could prove difficult .
acquiring powergen would give e.on instant access to two markets that present more near - term opportunities than elsewhere in europe .
the u.s. , by contrast , offers " a market with greater growth than in europe and an energy market that is very fragmented with a lot of opportunity for consolidation , " he said .

today 's issuealert sponsors : [ image ] looking for a billing engine to meet your company 's complex billing needs ?
itron has the technology and industry knowledge it takes to deliver an advanced and automated solution .
visit us at the cis conference to learn more about the mv - pbs billing and financial settlement system , the industry proven solution for the critical needs of large revenue customer billing and financial settlements .
much of the buzz throughout the conference focused on the current president 's just - released energy task plan , a 165-page report that outlines approximately 105 steps that the new administration will take to address current energy problems .
having talked with vice president dick cheney last evening , former president bush said he was aware that the new , broad - based plan focused heavily on new supply , along with secondary measures for conservation efforts .
this is an approach that the former president fully supports as he noted that " if you want to lower energy prices , you need to establish more supply .
meanwhile , the energy task plan released by the current president bush this morning holds few surprises but continues to spark a great deal of debate .
as has been the case since the start of the new administration , the continuing criticism of the new bush plan is that it is overly specific and strong on new supply efforts , while remaining vague and noncommittal to conservation efforts .
in addition , president bush has proposed providing tax benefits to co - generation plants , which produce both heat and electricity .
however , democrats have focused more heavily on conservation efforts in their own plan , as illustrated by a series of tax incentives to help consumers build energy efficient homes and purchase hybrid gas and electric automobiles .
that cooperation may be necessary as congress must approve president bush 's energy plan in order for it to take effect .
hi there - hope you are well , and enjoyed the weekend .
it was much too short for us ! !
i was wondering what the next steps are in terms of formalizing the role that you and i discussed in san antonio .
as fernley gets closer and closer to nailing my replacement , i am feeling more and more exposed .
i really do think that i would benefit greatly from more of a middle office focus , and have the management skills to supervise a large team of people .
i know i would bring a new perspective to the role , coming from more of a back office focus , and after my european experience know how to focus on key controls .
depending upon my replacement , it could be sooner .
i would need a few weeks to get things wrapped up in london like moving and packing etc . and re - established in houston -- need to buy cars etc .
but otherwise there should n't be too much downtime between places .
glad to discuss at any time x830

to identify and develop " best practices " reports and guidelines for accessing information in both the r/3 system and the data warehouse and to educate users as to the best solution for each reporting need .
those methods may include road shows and demos , articles in newsletters and on websites , and more individualized measures such as bu specific workshops and floor help sessions where data warehouse personnel are available to answer questions and help users become more comfortable using the data warehouse .
as we talk with the users in each group we believe we can gather information about best practices reports that are available and help to share this knowledge enterprise - wide .
in order to achieve these objectives prior to year end , we need your commitment and assistance .
your responsibilities will be : to assist in setting a strategic direction for improved reporting in each business unit through training , communication , new report development and knowledge sharing .
to provide assistance in the development and implementation of overall communications and training plans for each business unit to effectively reach the widest audience , including evaluation and recommendation of methods to encourage participation .
to provide input into the development of a forum for knowledge sharing among the business units to encourage more effective use of all available reporting tools and to share " best practices " reports .
we expect there will be two meetings per month , and you will be our contact in setting up sessions for your group to communicate information such as best practices and guidelines as to which tools are most effective for which reporting needs .
we will also be asking you to review the listing of essential reports , key metrics and information needs that we have compiled from the sunrise interviews last november and from the isc 's back - office review , to update this information in preparing the list of best practices reports .
to thank you for your participation in this process , the sunrise team will assist each of you in developing a new business objects report of your choice - best case , one that would replace a manual spreadsheet or otherwise help your group retrieve and report on data more effectively .

one of the advantages of a longer book is that the last chapter will be on industry developments a year or two out to see there things really land with or without enron .
what i have in mind is a two - year research and writing project -- or longer .
the history , unlike the books we are likely to see in the next year , would fully develop a number of energy , political economy , and corporate culture themes .
i will be happy to discuss some of my hypotheses of the negatives and sensitivities with you up front .
but i want to discuss what my book would be about in the hopes that i can interview you over the course of the research and writing .
i have about a month to finish a detailed outline of the book and produce some writing samples .
an agent will shop the proposal around , and we will see if the advance is enough to proceed .
i also might get some foundations or investors involved to make the economics work , and the early indication is that there will be support .
a lot of people would be very supportive of a full history rather than what we are likely to see in the next year .
i have a powerpoint presentation on the potential book and will be happy to visit with you .
it might be better to visit at the huntington , but the office is fine also .
here 's the e - mail i sent , thought i 'd try out the address .

` ` we expect to have a final negotiated contract in june and hope to start construction on specific projects by the end of the summer , ' ' lcra spokesman robert cullick said .
projects in the program , which require approval by the texas public utilities commission ( puc ) , include boosting the voltage on existing transmission lines , building new lines , upgrading substations , and hooking up new power plants .
according to the puc , texas currently has 27 new power plants under construction that will put nearly 14,000 megawatts on the grid when completed over the next few years , roughly enough electricity to supply 14 million homes .
earlier this month the north american electric reliability council ( nerc ) warned the texas transmission network -- though in far better shape than california 's struggling system -- was nevertheless in dire need of upgrades , and lumped it together with other potential hot spots like new england and new york city .
by expanding existing lines and building new ones we hope to relieve some of these bottlenecks , ' ' cullick said .

ordinary life - thoughts and ideas to help you live a happier life summary of december 30 , 2001
i hope you find this inspirational and valuable as you reflect on the year just passed and prepare for what is to come .
learning this art is important because we do n't have much time to live , do we ?
i have surrounded myself with countless devices for measuring the passing of time .
i experimented with various sizes and styles .
i think i was hoping that if i found the perfect system , i 'd be able to accomplish all that i wanted to .
i can experience how rapidly it passes and how slowly it drags out .
when i began doing sitting meditation i could experience time as if it were molasses or as a flash of lightening .
think of all the books we read , the instructions we follow , the activities we do just to help us structure time .
what a power we could be !
i said a moment ago that looking at the world spiritually is our only option .
you can look at the world religiously .
i had great hopes for you .
i could beat the daylights out of you .
if his master returns and finds that he has done a good job , there will be a reward ?
but what good does it do to watch and wait if we do n't know what we are looking for and waiting for ?
as you might guess , i 'm in the " historical - metaphorical " camp .
this would be very important to how i would describe my religious posture .
fundamentalism brings with it not only changes in how we view the bible but in how we view so much else .
i grew up being taught that i 'd better be careful because " jesus is coming back like a thief in the night .
and yet , i can say to you , that learning to wait for the second coming , is a large part of the art of living .
the second coming is not some date off out there in the future .
if we turn our backs on the present by concentrating on getting stuff into or keeping stuff out of our lives , we 'll miss god in the now .
you have to develop another way of seeing .
i want what happens in here to be about god in the world now and the urgency of finding god in the world now .
it is n't describing in advance a literal event that you could pick up on a radar screen .
a more accurate translation of it would be " presence .
our actions , whether good or not , have effects of infinite range and scope .
it is expecting something that has n't happened to happen and it is to be looking out for it .
at each moment we are free to change the significance of the past for the present and free to choose a new mode of expressing ourselves in the future .
" years ago , i was planning an event with my son and i asked him when he wanted to do it .
it 's the " happy " that is in this prayer i offer for and about you .
may you be peaceful and at ease .
may no difficulties come to you .
may you always meet with success .
just a tip lets you know if your friends have a problem with you . ?
7 is fine with me ( although i may be a few minutes after 7 ) .
it wo n't let up i 'm ready for summer .
maybe we can get together and grab a margarita sometime whenever i come back in .
if you have any further questions , please call one of the following for assistance :

a draw in oil stocks should deepen in the 1st quarter because of the cuts , and an expected seasonal build in the 2nd quarter should be less than previously expected , the iea said .
the delay could also prove a problem for the governor .
the book contends that the world will not be prepared to deal with the situation when the peak in production occurs .
the book says several events could zap supplies and create an energy crisis , including a big war in the middle east .
it points out that while there still may be a few huge oilfields left to discover , most have , or will shortly reach their maximum output level and begin to dry up .
according to the book , most new discoveries since 1975 have been mediocre .
they acknowledge that there will be a day when the world 's oil output will start to shrivel , but point out that improved technologies and economies will delay the decline .
in addition , new technologies being developed will decrease demand , expanding the timetable for the deterioration of oil supplies .
the shut down of refineries for retooling could mean that gasoline stocks may not build as fast as usual in the near future , but plants should be ready to produce at high levels leading into the peak summer driving season .

gemfire has figured out a way to combine diode arrays and waveguides into optical integrated circuits that can be produced using automated equipment .
gemfire has developed a diode array integrated with eight waveguides that would replace eight separate amplifiers , and thus could amplify eight separate strands of fiber .

vasher , an exceptional athlete who was a rare two - way first - time all - state performer last year , could work his way into the longhorns ' dime package ( six defensive backs ) during the season because he has the speed ( 10.48 100 meters ) to go along with good height at about 5 - 10 or 5 - 11 , that the coaches like in their cornerbacks .
he said the wide receivers the longhorns recruited this year can go a long ways toward beating bump - and - run coverage .

dear market participant , technical bulletin # 67 - automated mitigation procedure for the day - ahead market - and technical bulletin
digital island 's $ 630 million acquisition of sandpiper last week and akamai 's $ 2.2 billion pre - initial public offering valuation are likely to make merger and acquisition artists wonder how much their company would be worth with the inclusion of a sandpiper or akamai .
in a space where a year ago sandpiper was a lone evangelist and akamai a rocket from nowhere , new content distributors are popping up like mushrooms .
enron communications and exodus communications are trying to amend existing business models to take advantage of the new opportunity .

but i think we can get this priced down here inside the day .

yes - but i want you to verify .
thanks for the quick - turnaround on your comments .
as i said on the phone last night , we are working on a short deadline as well .
before making the changes you suggest , it would be helpful to get clarification on a couple of points :
i will also add your comments to the " energy and the venezuelan economy " from the first paper .
either we know what will be in the new law or we do n't .
i believe that what the new law might say is that the royalty scheme for the free gas will apply to the gas associated with oil production ( which is under the scope of the hydrocarbons law ) .
i hope the point above clarifies the issue .
i will definitely add your point about the plans to circulate the law to investors for review and would appreciate clarification on these other points .
i strongly believe that the regulatory risks for the lng projects are less significant than what might be expected .
i think that we fundamentally agree on these points and i will add your comments about the experience of enron people with pdvsa and with respect to enagas " being headed in the right direction .
this methodology should be out in about a month .
political / economic paper- congrats for your superb comments here , which i accept virtually unchanged .
depending on how you count because it was in the works for a long time , but debates on the law that was finally passed lasted about a year .
we believe there 's a real chance that the gas bidding rounds will be completed this year .
i sincerely appreciate your efforts on short notice .

i 'm sure i 've got something on output and probably reliability , but can you give me a thumb nail sketch of what we are looking for on the rest ?
eric , as we discussed , with ensr 's assistance i have developed a projected timeline for developing the ferc
even with the " collaborative approach " and all of the upfront work done with the environmental community to streamline the processing , the schedule is very , very optimistic and assumes that all conflicting issues will be resolved quickly and the processing continue .
the first part of the estimate would be to project the environmental cost , by quarters of preparing the 12 resource reports ( including the necessary field work ) that would get sun devil to an ferc filing in the first quarter of 2002 that would not be rejected .
the second component of the cost estimate would be to complete the field work and permitting phases during the processing of the application .
this would include assisting the third party environmental contractor in working on the eis to expedite the writing as needed .
once we get the " white paper " fatal flaw analysis that ensr is preparing for this project we will have enough information along with the budget to get us to the ferc filing to make some quantifiable decisions on moving forward when comparing those to the commercial advantages that you are developing .
i have asked beth to review the doorstep review plan for all of 2001 and to recommend any changes in timing and approach .
soon after she returns , she will review and update the suggested doorstep review schedule .
after that has been updated , she will review the revised schedule with rick causey for any additional input and concurrence on the selection of key offices / businesses to review and the timing of such .
with beth 's knowledge of the businesses in london , i am sure we will benefit from her eye towards effective scheduling of the reviews .

former oracle president and coo ray lane predicts the future for dot - coms raymond j. lane , former president of oracle corporation and new general partner at the silicon valley venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield & byers ( kpcb ) , will give his vision of the future of the new economy to the haas community on friday , november 3 , at 4:00 p.m.
since his change in positions , lane has been quoted extensively that he believes the venture business is going to shift from just funding companies to playing an even larger role in building those companies .
lane originally joined oracle as president of oracle usa after working as a senior partner in the consulting firm of booz allen & hamilton .
more information on lane can be found at http://www.kpcb.com/. the business faculty research dialogues will be sponsored again this year by the clausen center for international business and policy and california management review .
among his many achievements was establishing awards for outstanding teaching to faculty selected and presented by students .

further , there may be credit issues associated with the transactions and/or master agreements ( in the form of specific credit provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement ) .
see attachment please circulate this information to all interested parties in your group .
lousie , i would be grateful if you could review the transaction below , which will require your approval .
rac is comfortable with the changes , as it will result in a significant saving in storage costs and allow the lpg trader to flatten his book .
further , whilst there maybe the potential of mtm movement between the $ 180 purchase price from borealis and the subsequent sale ( index related price ) back to the counterpart , this will be netted out .
the only issue is whether houston has sufficient resources or are willing to pay the storage costs early , which could range between $ 1,200,000-?1,400,000 .
if this is feasible i will recommend that we negotiate a discount of $ 15 on storage costs ( saving $ 600,000 ) as opposed to $ 10 .
the likely timeframe for selling the product would be jan. 2002 as that is the highest otc swap price mkt which in turn would mean payment to borealis would be due on 30 days past b / l.
ie early feb. borealis are very concerned about enron 's ability to meet it 's payment obligation and has suggested a transaction that in several ways would suit the lpg book .
pls let me know if you need further information .
borealis would purchase the product in tank at an indexed related price which would fit the london lpg book very well 3 .
the contractual obligations to lift the storage tons would be further complicated by the fact that the one physical trader most likely will not be here much longer .

since the nymex has just announced that they are going to continue the shortened trading hours ( 10:45 to 1:45 pm eastern time ) for next week i was wondering what the aga 's plans are for releasing the storage report for the week ending september 21 , 2001 .
the storage information will be very important to the market .
i wanted to express several concerns i have with the circumstances surrounding the decision by the aga to delay the release of the storage survey report for the week ending september 14 , 2001 .
i question what the new york mercantile exchange has to do with supplying the market with needed information .
i interpreted the explanation of the cause of the delay to be nymex wanted to be open for the release of the information .
i would appreciate your comments to the above .
i know i can not come close to understanding the emotions and hurdles the nymex has to overcome in light of the wtc tragedy .

based on your questions and feedback , we want to further clarify the double match and share with you some further modifications we are making to the administration of the match .
doubling the match doubling the match will accelerate the rate at which company matching contributions accumulate .
however , the annual company matching contributions remain limited to 50 percent of an employee 's pre - tax contributions , up to 6 percent of eligible compensation .
truing up " the match for previous contributions many participants in the plan expressed concern that contributions to the plan prior to july were not eligible for the reinstated company match .
if at the end of 2002 , the matched amount falls short of the maximum level possible based on the participant 's annual pre - tax contributions to the plan , the company will " true up " their match for 2002 to ensure the company contributions equal what would have been received had the match not been suspended .
for example , if an active employee 's annual pre - tax contribution to the plan will reach $ 11,000 , and on july 1 the employee has already contributed $ 7,000 , the remaining employee pre - tax contribution allowed will be $ 4000 .
with the double match , the employee will receive $ 4,000 in company matching contributions between july and december , but will be $ 1,500 short of the company matching contributions
however , at the end of the year , they too will receive a true up to reach the maximum company match contributions for their annual pre - tax employee contribution .
the total amount of company matching contributions , including any true up , will be based on year - to - date contributions up to the time the participant is terminated .
if a plan participant resigns voluntarily , he or she is not eligible for a true up , but will receive the double match on any pre - tax contributions made to the plan between july 1 and his or her termination .
please email me with requests for central deals .

/ reg hi jan , i think your suggestion of establishing regular communication between our groups is a very good one .
maybe we should start with a monthly conference call .
the quality of video conferencing between london and houston does n't seem to be very good , and i think it is quite expensive .
should we try just doing a phone conference to see if that is adequate ?
perhaps we could further refine the scope , participation and timeframe for the working groups .

the energy company would pay an additional $ 750,000 to secure naming rights for the entire astrodome complex , including the dome , the astroarena and a new exposition center .
the deal , expected to include a stadium suite for reliant , extensive advertising throughout the facility and rides on the team plane for company executives , would run for 30 years .
if reliant is chosen , the county also would receive $ 400,000 a year for giving the energy company the exclusive right to provide power .
although the naming rights deal encompasses the astrodome and astroarena , the rights to those buildings could be resold if they are refurbished for different purposes , two county sources said .
if the county were to build a new arena at the complex , reliant would be given the first option to bid on the name .
he declined to say how soon the company would arrive at a decision .

nichols ' project , expected to be completed in 2006 , is truly enormous .
nichols is planning to develop the wind farms with clipper llc , a recently formed santa barbara , calif.-based wind development firm .
nichols and ken hach , clipper 's new project developer and a former employee of enron corp. 's ( ene ) wind development unit , hope to support the project by inking long - term power contracts with midwestern utilities like chicago 's
this new project , however , is considerably more complex and faces plenty of potential stumbling blocks .
and new transmission lines will have to be strung , something few utilities have been able to accomplish on any scale in recent years .
although the developers could look to existing plants in the region , the back - up they 're eying is new coal .
according to nichols , some coal companies in wyoming are ready and willing to build six 500-megawatt plants to support the wind power contracts .
florida 's fpl group , ( fpl ) , the largest wind - power operator in the u.s. , is already looking at acquiring land in south dakota , burg said .
we definitely see ( south dakota ) as a place to be in the future , " said fpl spokeswoman cathy scott .
we 've done some development work in the area , " gates said .
and we 've been talking with clipper and other developers on a variety of projects in the area .
but he did say enron has worked with nichols before and has the capability to develop every aspect of a wind generating project .
hach , while acknowledging the difficulties of raising financing for wind projects , said funds could probably be found .

Re: looks like we got an offense coordinator
bob , i want to make sure i keep you in the loop on the ebs / bmc / networks / global strategic sourcing interactions .
ebs has worked out an additional 25 % discount , which brings the total discount structure to enron to a 45%-off pricing level , if ebs and enron aggregate their spend opportunity .
this should come as good news to anyone at net works who might be about to implement a bmc solution .

osman sezgen krishna , osman has informed me that he has been requested to provide research services to a larger number of clients in ees , leaving him less time to contribute to our work here at the eam desk .
while i am happy for him and believe that the company will benefit from his services , i am concerned that he may not be available at a crucial time in the development of the eam option strategy .

i am expecting two of the team members to start in san francisco in the near future .
my request is for osman to be available to this team for one day a week for the next several months , preferably until christmas .

on the other hand , i 've been using e - mail for 20 years or so , so i at least have some context in which to think about it .
a sound backup rotation , with tapes regularly moving to offsite storage , plus an up - to - date logbook in a fireproof safe , will make locating the correct tape fairly easy .

those skills came in handy when el paso got the hammer blow from pg&e in 1996 and 1997 .
then wise set off on a plan to absorb other pipeline companies so he could expand his system of delivering natural gas throughout the united states .
the strategy was that if the state was going to ditch el paso , el paso would make sure its reach became so extended in other directions that it would never be dependent on one market again .
he was just able to see the possibilities that nobody here in california was able to see .
great for anyone with space reserved on the pipeline -- but disastrous for those left out in the cold .
he points to company plans to expand pipelines heading here and to even build a power plant at san francisco international airport .
by the time the el paso merchant energy contract expires may 31 , opening the crucial block of pipeline capacity to what critics say is true competition for the first time in more than three years , it will be far too late , morris said .
